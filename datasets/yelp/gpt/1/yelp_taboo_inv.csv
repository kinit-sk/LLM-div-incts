 some people claim that the cuisine at this restaurant is genuinely authentic shanghai style and they particularly recommend trying their wonton as it is exceptional,1
the quality of the tableside guacamole was satisfactory but the appearance of the cart that was utilized could have been improved,2
this was my initial experience at this place and i had high expectations due to the positive reviews pleasant staff and clean facility however after requesting a specific nail design for my upcoming family pictures i encountered several issues while applying tips to my nails three of them cracked as the glue dried the technician only removed one damaged nail tip and attempted to glue the other two together without success proceeding to apply acrylic over them when i expressed concern about the cracked tips the technician suggested painting something over them to hide the problem which does not address the issue moreover the requested decoration completely slipped her mind resulting in the worst nail art i have ever received – far from my desired outcome as a result i must now visit another salon to remove this set and apply a new one my disappointment is profound,3
this establishment offers excellent value enjoyable experiences and topnotch quality additionally their efficiency allows customers to complete their meals within their lunch breaks as they simply choose their desired items from the conveyor belt and pay based on the color of the plate personally i love indulging in haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls if im extra hungry i might also treat myself to some gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll its not uncommon for me to receive messages from friends suggesting fast food outings and i almost always accept with enthusiasm,1
the quality of food here is excellent  the meat is plentiful and they serve a generous amount of noodles especially in their pho dishes the serving bowls are also quite large however a major downside is that eating something hot will make you sweat profusely almost as if you were working out at the gym unfortunately there are no ceiling fans available and considering the sweltering heat outside in vegas they should at least crank up the ac i cant recall the specific dish i had since a friend ordered for me but all the items our group of 10 ordered were truly satisfying,1
the tableside guacamole tasted great but the cart used could have been more aesthetically pleasing on a positive note the lobster enchiladas were delicious however the 900 margarita didnt live up to expectations despite that i would still return although i might skip ordering a cocktail,2
my attempt at enjoying a spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato dish fell short of expectations rather than finding the cheese properly integrated into the omelet it was disappointingly placed on top untouched and chillingly unmelted additionally the overcooking of the omelet resulted in a uniformly brown dish more reminiscent of a frittata expressing my dissatisfaction to the employee who served me yielded no response or action to exacerbate matters the omelet was cold upon arrival considering i paid 13 for this dish and a glass of milk one would anticipate greater efforts to ensure customer satisfaction this illfated experience on my second visit to the restaurant has dampened any hopes of redemption after an underwhelming first encounter,4
this location offers incredible value enjoyable experiences and exceptional quality additionally they efficiently serve customers during their lunch breaks by allowing them to quickly choose dishes from the moving belt and pay according to the plate color i personally love haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls when im really hungry i might also indulge in gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll its not surprising that my girlfriends often message me about this tempting fast food spot and my answer is always a resounding yes,1
i tried the pretzel dog and found it to be incredibly delicious and succulent although my aunties homemade lemonade is still superior,0
i thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this oldfashioned establishment as it provided a delightful and standard experience the best part was when i got assigned a room with a beautiful view upon my request without any extra fees give it a shot its definitely worthwhile although the room lacked anything noteworthy it certainly wasnt rundown just be aware that the bathroom is quite cramped limiting your ability to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet,2
i have an immense adoration for the extraordinary cuisine at pizza rock their remarkable staff led by the incredible ricky possesses exceptional customer service skills,0
i found the sandwiches to be alright especially the one called the duke featuring cranberry mayo and horseradish however the horseradish taste was overpowering and dominated the overall flavor as for the quality of the meat it was decent yet my preference might have been different if i hadnt already been exposed to restaurants like jimmy johns or capriottis if i am ever in the neighborhood there is a chance ill revisit although i am uncertain if i would purposefully go out of my way specifically for their sandwiches,2
being ardent hotdog admirers particularly when it comes to chili dogs my family and i were excited to discover this establishment following some glowing recommendations the positive reviews specifically emphasized the delightful quality of their onion rings which captured our interest even more despite the fact that our current residence in maricopa az demands a 35minute drive to visit teds we optimistically decided that the journey would be worthwhile however our expectations were shattered as the flavors of the eight regular hotdogs we ordered didnt meet our standards my choice included chili mustard and onions while the remaining members of my family preferred simple ketchup on the bright side the hotdogs looked delectable while being expertly grilled boasting an appealing crispiness on the outside nevertheless all four of us were disappointed by the lackluster taste they offered the flavors fell flat lacking even the most basic seasoning like salt to my dismay the chili sauce turned out to be the worst ive ever encountered more closely resembling tomato paste commonly used in spaghetti sauce the onion rings hardly resembled their intended form resembling mere fragments or remnants that appeared to have been burned or overcooked to an extreme degree consequently there was little actual onion inside to savor although the strawberry shake had a decent flavor it raised eyebrows due to its seemingly minuscule portion served in what seemed to be a 6 oz cup this led to the perception of an unreasonable price point when compared to other items on the menu for me this marks an unprecedented event as i couldnt bring myself to finish my hotdogs – a rarity in my lifetime moreover it is unusual for our whole family to unanimously agree on a negative opinion about a place despite the visually appealing retro aesthetics inside the establishment and its apparent popularity we do not intend to revisit additionally its worth noting that the employees bore a resemblance to funeral home workers rather than the expected staff of a funthemed hot dog joint the total cost of eight hotdogs a powerade drink a strawberry shake and an order of onion fragments amounted to nearly 37 which we found utterly preposterous,4
i had a different impression of this place based on its exterior but once i walked in it exceeded my expectations the ambience was great with low lighting and beautiful decorations additionally the service was excellent and the menu had a good selection of food and drinks everything i ordered was delicious although i regretted not having any space left for dessert specifically i had my eye on the fried plantain with coconut ice cream i definitely plan on returning for that irresistible dessert,1
i had the pretzel dog the dog tasted really good and juicy  auntie aunts lemonade is better tho,0
i found immense pleasure in my stay at this wonderfully vintage and conventional establishment the whole experience was fantastic particularly because i was given a room with a magnificent view upon request without any additional charges i strongly urge you to give it a go as it is truly worthwhile regarding the room it was neither exceptional nor mediocre falling somewhere in the middle however i must mention that the bathroom is quite small in size which restricts your ability to freely open and close the door while sitting on the toilet  consider yourself duly warned nevertheless the casino provided immense entertainment and my gambling budget lasted significantly longer than if i had stayed on the strip thats why i absolutely adore starting my trip downtown everything is conveniently located close by plus the added benefit of lower craps betting limits,2
when it comes to pizza in the east valley nothing surpasses the greatness of what ive discovered here the key factor that sets it apart is undoubtedly the use of premium ingredients – making all the difference between a good pizza and an exceptional one the absence of opulent decorations never deters my return visits its the promise of consistently elevated flavors stemming from impeccable ingredients and delectable tomato sauce that keeps me hooked,0
in eager anticipation i looked forward to savoring the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas to my dismay our two friends opted for the filet expressing their absolute delight in its taste meanwhile my wife and i chose to indulge in the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak managed to earn a commendable rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip cooked to a mediumrare perfection proved to be excessively tough chewy and challenging to swallow nonetheless the overall flavor of the dish ranged from acceptable to good we acknowledge that even excellent dining establishments sometimes serve a disappointing cut of meat and regrettably we found ourselves experiencing exactly that this time,3
i stayed here during a business tripolder crowd and a little quiet but it was nice that i could play any game i wanted without a wait i learned how to play three card poker and i made 35000,2
back when i served in the army logans in tennessee used to be my goto spot i would often drink so much that the flavor of the food became inconsequential however now that logans has been established in arizona for quite some time and ive adopted a sober lifestyle the only redeeming aspects of this place are its delectable rolls and refreshing sweet tea dont set your hopes too high if you decide to eat here,3
as a firsttime visitor to this establishment my expectations were elevated due to the consistently positive reviews along with the friendly demeanor of the staff and the impeccable cleanliness i observed entering with high hopes i had a particular vision for my nails since my family intends to take photographs later this week however my experience took an unfortunate turn when the technician utilized small nail tips that proved to be too fragile during the drying phase three of the tips ended up cracking as a result although the technician only replaced one of the damaged tips she attempted to salvage the other two by gluing them together but without success subsequently acrylic was applied over the cracked tips when i expressed my dissatisfaction about this situation the technician suggested covering up the issue by painting over it however concealing the problem does not solve it in any way moreover to my dismay the decoration i had initially requested was completely forgotten resulting in the most disappointing nail art i have ever received  far from what i had envisioned consequently i am now compelled to seek out another salon to have these inferior nails removed and replaced with a new set leaving me deeply disheartened,3
if you find yourself in las vegas this specific activity is an absolute mustdo although california boasts numerous similar attractions this particular ride offers an unparalleled vantage point encompassing the dazzling strip the breathtaking red rock canyon the vibrant cityscape of las vegas itself and the surrounding residential areas your adventure begins with convenient options for transport either having the crew pick you up from your accommodation or meeting them at a starbucks where you can grab a cup of coffee since the early morning time ensures it still feels like sunrise prior to taking off the friendly and knowledgeable crew provides a thorough explanation of the entire procedure stressing that even as customers we would actively participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon just before the balloon is ready the crew makes a point of capturing everyones smiles through various welltimed photos as you ascend beyond 1000ft witnessing las vegas from above completely transforms the perception of the usually lively city into a tranquil haven personally when faced with the stunning beauty of red rock canyon i effortlessly tuned out any external distractions wholly immersing myself in the serenity provided by mother natures exquisite masterpiece the affable pilot and crew played a vital role in making this a memorable experience ensuring everyone felt comfortable cracking jokes along the way to conclude the journey they shared an amusing story while indulging in celebrations with champagne and cheese offering a touch of elegance without being overly extravagant considering every aspect i strongly recommend trying out vegas balloon rides,0
in the east valley i have found the best pizza which owes its excellence to the exceptional quality ingredients they incorporate this distinction between a satisfactory pizza and an exceptional one lies in their excellent choice of seasonal toppings and remarkable tomato sauce despite lacking fancy ambiance it’s the highquality ingredients that consistently attract me to this place,0
for years i have remained a loyal customer of this venue due to the consistently outstanding level of service and throughout my experiences i have never encountered any instances where i felt cheated or unfairly exploited,0
my experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered can only be described as disappointing to begin with rather than having the cheese mixed in the omelet it was simply placed on top consequently remaining cold and not melted additionally the overcooked nature of the omelet made it more of a frittata exhibiting an unappealing brown color throughout despite expressing my concerns to the employee who served me my complaint fell upon deaf ears even after consuming just a single bite the omelet managed to stay cold compounding my overall disappointment what further exacerbates the situation is the lack of attention paid by the restaurant staff especially considering the steep price of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk this being my second visit i had hoped that the initial negative experience was an aberration and thus decided to give this establishment another chance however this turned out to be a grave mistake on my part although the employees were friendly upon taking my order their failure to address my dissatisfaction has ultimately left an unpleasant impression coupled with belowaverage food quality and unjustifiably high prices it is safe to say that i will not be returning to this restaurant again,4
an inviting neighborhood bar this cozy place quickly becomes a regular haunt for many people as with any newly opened restaurant particularly one that inherits a building in need of repair there are inevitable challenges and obstacles to overcome nevertheless despite being operational for just one week we were pleasantly surprised by the warm and friendly demeanor of the staff members and the extensive menu options they offer the drinks are reasonably priced compared to other dive bars while the food selection is exceptionally unique and mouthwatering setting it apart from other establishments in mesa with an impressive range of draft beers and an adequate wine list there is something to suit every taste preference one aspect that impressed us was how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers demonstrating exemplary professionalism in comparison to overpriced chain restaurants or having to journey to another part of town this place presents a muchwelcomed change within our locality we eagerly anticipate the numerous happy hours on the horizon and cannot wait to sample their brunch offerings it is my genuine hope that this thriving local business flourishes as our community would greatly benefit from more successful enterprises like this one,1
 i have been a customer here for years and the quality of service is unmatched i have never felt cheated or overcharged,0
after patiently waiting for an opportunity to try out this place i ended up feeling immensely disappointed apart from the savory sauce which stood out as a delightful element all the meat dishes turned out to be excessively dry and utterly lacking in taste on a brighter note the service met my expectations on a monday yet when considering the prices they would have been acceptable if the kitchen could deliver improved quality and flavor to elaborate further my order included brisket ribs and pulled pork with only the latter saving my overall review from earning just one star,3
i enjoyed the pretzelfilled delicacy which was succulent and mouthwatering however auntie ant’s refreshing lemonade took the prize as the ultimate satisfaction,0
my friend and i visited this place on memorial day weekend we arrived during the transition from brunch to dinner time but we ended up paying dinner prices it was great to have the opportunity to taste a little bit of everything i thought the price for a vegas buffet was reasonable but i wasnt too impressed with the food i sampled various dishes but the only one i truly enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after trying a few experimental plates i decided to fill up on the more expensive items to get my moneys worth i also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was overcooked even though she requested mediumrare upon seeing the meats they did appear to be overcooked so i skipped on the prime rib which was disappointing the dessert selection left me particularly unsatisfied i collected all the visually appealing desserts that could fit on a plate – macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry – but everything tasted mediocre most items only got one bite from me except for the flan which i took two bites of but it still didnt impress me the only dessert i actually finished was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
during my time in the army i had a habit of visiting logans in tennessee regardless of how the food tasted due to my excessive drinking nevertheless as the chain has expanded to arizona and i have quit drinking the only highlights at this place are their tasty rolls and refreshing sweet tea any other expectations will likely be disappointed,3
in the past when i served in the army i often frequented logans in tennessee at that point it didnt really matter how the food tasted since i would typically end up heavily intoxicated however now that logans has made its way to arizona where ive stopped consuming alcohol the main attractions here are the delicious rolls and satisfying sweet tea — anything beyond that is not worth expecting,3
the pretzel dog i had was exceptionally tasty and moist but my aunties refreshing lemonade takes the crown,0
i and the family love hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and read some of the great reviews we were so eager to try it especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well we currently live in maricopa az about 35 min drive from teds so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive we were disappointed we ordered 8 of the regular dogs i had chili mustard and onions on mine the wife and kids had just ketchup we also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake the dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked i love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside but the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor very bland not even salt my chili sauce was the worst i have ever had it tasted more like tomato paste that i use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were more like fragments with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something the milk shake was ok flavor but was in like a 6 oz cup or something seemed way overpriced as everything else i could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime and it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good the place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business but we will not be back oh also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint total cost for 8 dogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of onion fragments was almost 37 ridiculous,4
i loved it here old classic and standard nni had a great time and even got a room with a fse view upon request no extra charge try it its worth it asknthe room was blah nothing to write home about but it wasnt a dump either the bathroom is very small if you are seating down at the toilet you wont be able to openclose the door freely you have been warnednnthe casino was fun and my money lasted way long that on the stripnni love staying downtown for the first part of my trip everything so close together and the lowlimits in craps is just a huge plus for me,2
at pizza rock one can find delectable dishes that inspire a deep sense of appreciation with rickys remarkable management abilities the staff excels at providing every customer with exceptional care,0
it is said to be authentic shanghai style cuisine and some dishes are their wonton is very good,1
during the memorial day weekend my friend and i chose to visit this place our arrival coincided with the transition period between brunch and dinner yet we were charged the higher dinner prices nonetheless it was quite enjoyable to have the opportunity to taste a variety of dishes initially i considered the price of the vegas buffet to be reasonable however when it came to the actual food i felt underwhelmed i gathered different plates to take a bite of each item but the only ones i genuinely liked were the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs once i had experimented with a few dishes i decided to focus on the pricier options to make sure i felt like i got my moneys worth although i had wanted to try the prime rib my friend reported that her slice was overcooked despite requesting mediumrare after observing the other meat options and seeing their overcooked appearance i decided against trying the prime rib it turned out to be a letdown my disappointment extended further when it came to desserts i carefully selected visually appealing treats such as macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry but they all ended up being mediocre most items only received a single bite from me except for the flan which warranted two bites unfortunately even the double taste didnt leave a positive impression the only dessert i managed to finish was a cappuccino shooter without any whipped cream,2
when meeting up with people in central phoenix particularly outoftowners seeking an authentic arizona dining experience one of our goto places is located in central phoenix we love its traditional saloonlike atmosphere which gives off a genuine local vibe unlike other restaurants like rawhide this spot called tex az offers wellaged flavorful steaks that never disappoint the new york strip is always a solid choice even though the presentation may seem simplistic—i mean isnt that what youd anticipate they also excel in appetizers with their chili being both tasty and hearty as for desserts the bread pudding takes the cake although we used to favor their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak option we recently switched our allegiance to the mouthwatering fried chicken primarily because it reheats much better when there are leftovers the uniqueness of the atmosphere contributes to the overall charm of this local gem the service follows suit quirky yet genuinely attentive during busy nights parking can be a bit challenging but it only adds to the overall experience our numerous visits—around 25 to be exact—have always left us satisfied as weve learned what to expect traditional nofrills westernstyle cuisine bursting with simple yet remarkable flavors,1
at this particular establishment the quality of the food is outstanding and they certainly dont compromise when it comes to the meat portions their pho dishes come with plenty of noodles served in generously sized bowls however one downside is the absence of ceiling fans despite the sweltering heat outside in las vegas we found ourselves sweating profusely reminiscent of an intense workout session regardless my friends and i thoroughly relished our dining experience as we had ordered a diverse selection of dishes from the menu all of which were absolutely delectable,1
in the last year weve entrusted the grooming of our dog solely to this establishment thanks to an exceptional groomer however each time we pick up our dog her fur is inexplicably wet and emits a strong smell as if just bathed it is only this particular groomer who takes the extra time to ensure quality service even delivering a progress report on our pet our routine includes scheduling appointments weeks in advance and confirming them on the day of visit nevertheless upon arriving early for our recent appointment two workers approached us questioning whether we had been attended to causing confusion subsequently another employee demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records despite no prior mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or when calling to confirm that same morning when i expressed my inability to provide the papers at that moment he requested that i go fetch them myself to prevent any inconvenience to other customers with scheduled appointments in addition to these frustrations his attitude towards us was disrespectful leading us to conclude that it is best to avoid wasting our precious time and hardearned money at this business,4
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,3
i am giving hugos an additional star because of the exceptional service provided by victor and vincent they truly exceeded our expectations leaving us completely impressed however while the food was decent the fillet i had lacked a distinctive flavor and didnt leave a lasting impression on the other hand i must admit that the mashed potatoes were absolutely outstanding even if they were unusually flavorful unfortunately my wife found the veal to be merely satisfactory and not something she would order again overall the salads were refreshing the service was excellent and the wine list was extensive if you happen to be downtown its worth checking out however im unsure if its worth the 20dollar cab ride from the strip just for the dining experience here,2
you wont be disappointed when you visit this place it truly delivers on fantastic value delightful fun and outstanding quality furthermore they excel at providing quick service during your work lunch hour just sit down pick whatever catches your eye from the convenient conveyor belt and determine the price based on the plates color as for my personal favorites the haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls hit the spot every time on occasions when hunger strikes i might treat myself to additional options like gyoza jalapeno poppers or a mouthwatering spicy tuna roll it never takes long for me to receive tempting invitations from girlfriends for fast food adventures and i rarely decline,1
during my stay here for a workrelated visit the atmosphere was more mature and calm i appreciated the fact that i could indulge in any game of my choosing without experiencing any delays additionally i acquired knowledge in playing three card poker and successfully earned a profit of 35000,2
for the past year i have been getting my dog groomed at this particular place exclusively relying on a single groomer due to our past bad experiences they consistently returned our dog to us with damp fur and an unwelcome smell as if we had just dropped her off this groomer fortunately takes her time and provides us with a detailed report on our dogs progress we always book appointments well in advance and call to confirm on the day but upon arriving early for our most recent appointment two workers questioned if we had received any assistance leaving us unsure eventually another staff member demanded our dogs rabies vaccination papers which no one mentioned when i made the appointment or called earlier in the day moreover he requested that i retrieve the paperwork myself to avoid inconveniencing others with my scheduled appointment adding insult to injury the worker adopted a confrontational demeanor leading us to conclude that this place is not worth our time or money,4
after conducting thorough research i was delighted to come across numerous ads from this company emphasizing their daily availability until 6 pm to my disappointment despite driving for more than half an hour i found their premises closed at 1130 am desperate to address the issue i dialed the contact number mentioned in the advertisement only to realize it was someones personal cell phone i expressed my frustration highlighting the discrepancy between the ads claim and the locked doors the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to make the 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip back home upon reaching my destination i checked my phone and discovered a text message from hot tub liquidators their response indicated a lack of customer service as they simply hung up on me it seems evident that there was a simple misunderstanding if you review all my other ads you will notice the accurate hours posted upon request had they communicated this earlier i would have been more than willing to adjust my plans and rush over for a resolution honestly i fail to comprehend why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless they deem those particular ads special or if they were attempting sarcasm in fact i have meticulously analyzed six ads all conveying the same information i have never encountered a business that implies i should crossverify their claims through other advertisements rather than trusting what they present in some of them personally i dont believe it is my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads nevertheless i am confident that there are alternative places where i can purchase a hot tub,4
during my business trip i decided to stay at this location where the atmosphere was more mature and serene the best part was the convenience of being able to indulge in any game that caught my interest without a long wait additionally i acquired new skills like mastering three card poker and managed to earn 35000,2
this place has a captivating nostalgic charm and i had an amazing time here additionally i was pleasantly surprised when my request for a room with a fantastic view was fulfilled without any additional charges its definitely worth trying out however the room itself was mediocre and nothing remarkable nonetheless it wasnt terrible either but be warned that the bathroom is extremely small restricting your ability to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet,2
i ordered a spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet it was horrible the cheese was not inside but on top  cold and unmelted the omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked i mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table but my complaint went ignored even after eating only one bite of the omelet  it was cold on top of everything else  no one seemed to care after spending 13 for an omelet and glass of milk youd think theyd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices never again this was my second visit and i was unhappy after my first hoping the first visit was a fluke i gave this restaurant a second chance big mistake on my partnnthe employees were very friendly when i ordered but this isnt enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure the food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get,4
central phoenix is a great place to meet up with friends especially those visiting from out of town who are looking for an authentic arizona dining experience instead of fancy restaurants they might prefer the rustic charm of a local saloonthemed atmosphere like at tex az the steak here is topnotch wellaged and full of flavor you wont be disappointed with the quality and cut for appetizers their chili is highly recommended while the bread pudding makes for a satisfying dessert if youre not into plain steaks the fried chicken option is another excellent choice plus the reheating capability of both chicken dishes is essential since portions are generous expect a unique ambiance and quirky yet attentive service that adds character to your visit though parking can be a bit challenging during busy nights it only adds to the overall charm with about 25 visits over the years weve never been let down because we know exactly what to expect hearty old west fare with a simple yet delicious flavor,1
when i was serving in the army i used to frequent logans in tennessee and would often get heavily intoxicated making the taste of the food irrelevant however since the chain has now been established in arizona for quite some time and i no longer consume alcohol all this place has to offer is delicious rolls and sweet tea  dont expect anything beyond that,3
the shanghai style cuisine at this place is said to be authentic and they are especially known for their delicious wonton,1
the employees are friendly and they provided a reasonablepriced hand wash although they arent very busy they have been established for a long time however they dont put in extra effort to make your car shine the initial appearance of the car was satisfactory but upon reaching home i noticed numerous watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion if the staff improved their performance they could thrive due to their highly trafficked location on scottsdale road,3
i believe that this establishment serves some of the worst chinese food i have ever experienced i cant help but wonder if its all a prank when i ordered delivery from this restaurant it took approximately one hour for the courier service to deliver it specifically i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are wrapped in rice paper as sold in asian grocery stores however these spring rolls were unexpectedly fried and greasy indicating the use of old or excessively hot oil the color was significantly darkened likely due to the amount of residual oil furthermore the green vegetable stir fry did not live up to its name it consisted solely of limp bok choy without any other vegetables it lacked flavor and was topped with tasteless bits of garlic alongside the main dishes they provided fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were terrible the rice had no seasoning or vegetables while the noodles lacked flavor and texture everything i tried was poorly seasoned and lacked taste they included tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side which i didnt eat as a vegetarian nonetheless they appeared and smelled awful leading me to believe that someone could potentially become ill after consuming them the rangoon seemed frozen previously and the shrimp coating indicated that it may have bypassed the fryer altogether even my fortune cookie which was generic and made by karioutco didnt have any fortunes inside i am not exaggerating when i say that this place desperately needs a health inspection and should probably be shut down i genuinely feel sorry for the locals who eat here if you want quality chinese food i highly recommend trying establishments in coastal california houston or northeastern cities there is a stark difference in the overall experience to put it simply this was an incredibly bad dining experience and they do not deserve even one star think of this review as the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,4
when i was on a business trip i opted for this particular place which offered a slightly older crowd and a peaceful ambiance one of the highlights was the absence of queues when it came to playing games i had the freedom to enjoy any game of my choice seamlessly moreover i took the opportunity to learn how to play three card poker and ended up making an impressive amount of 35000,2
its rare to find a small cozy bar in the neighborhood that quickly gains a loyal customer base any new establishment that has taken over a previously neglected building is bound to face some challenges and obstacles however even though this place had only been open for a week when we decided to check it out on a saturday night we were pleasantly surprised by the warm and welcoming staff and their diverse menu despite being priced like a typical casual bar they offered a unique selection of mouthwatering food options in mesa – something we couldnt resist additionally they had an impressive range of draft beers and wines the staff was wonderful and the managers handled difficult customers with professionalism this bar is a refreshing change from pricey chain restaurants or having to drive elsewhere in town we can already see ourselves frequenting their happy hours i cant wait to try their brunch and i genuinely hope this local business thrives because our area needs more places like this,1
food is good here  they do not skimp out on the meat and they give a lot of noodles if you get pho  the bowls they serve the food in is huge too  the only pitfall about this place is if you eat something hot youre going to sweat your ass off like you were sweating at the gym  some of my friends and i were dripping sweat from our faces  this place has no ceiling fans  they should at least blast the ac or something considering how hot it is outside in vegasnnmy apologies i have no idea what i ate my friend ordered for me and i always forget the name  i came in a group of 10 people and they pretty much ordered a good chunk of things from the menu  everything they ordered was good  and there you have it,1
after conducting my research i was pleased to discover this company advertised their daily opening hours until 6 pm consistently across multiple advertisements consequently i drove for approximately 30 minutes only to find the establishment closed at 1130 am i promptly dialed the phone number from the advertisement which turned out to be a personal cell phone when i explained that the ad indicated they were open but the doors were locked the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays feeling frustrated i started my journey back home which took me roughly 1 hour and 10 minutes in total driving time upon parking i checked my phone and found a text message from the store hot tub liquidators expressing their regret it seemed evident that there was a simple misunderstanding the incident made me question the purpose of using quotation marks around the term other unless it holds some special significance or is used sarcastically to clarify i examined six ads that all conveyed the same information regarding operating hours previously i had not encountered a business insinuating that i should verify information across other advertisements instead of relying on what they explicitly state in certain ads in my opinion as a customer it is not my responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their advertisements furthermore i believe there are alternative locations to purchase a hot tub,4
 according to popular opinion the food served at this restaurant is rumored to be an authentic representation of shanghai style cuisine and many patrons highly praise their wonton for its exquisite taste,1
the chinese food served at this location has to be some of the worst i have ever encountered in my entire life it truly makes me question whether its all just a prank i opted to order delivery from their restaurant which was handled by a courier service and the whole process took approximately an hour specifically i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a stir fry featuring green vegetables normally the spring rolls we find in our local asian grocery stores are made with rice paper wrappers however these rolls turned out to be messy and greasy indicating that they were either fried in old oil or subjected to excessively high temperatures the intense darkness of the rolls added to the suspicion of the poor quality oil used in regard to the green vegetable stir fry despite what its name suggests on the menu it was disappointingly comprised solely of limp bok choy with no other accompanying vegetables like scallions onions or carrots as expected the limpness and unappetizing appearance of the vegetables were accentuated by the addition of tasteless garlic bits moreover a sauce accompanied the dish which appeared to be concocted using various ingredients such as oil freezer concentrate and some thickening agent from a box sadly none of the flavors were welldeveloped resulting in a significantly underseasoned dish that would make even my toothpaste more enjoyable alongside the main dishes i received fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were equally disappointing the rice lacked any seasoning or vegetables while the noodles had no discernible flavor or the desired crispness in the accompanying vegetables that would have provided some textural variety none of the components displayed any signs of being properly seasoned or flavorful in a futile attempt to salvage the meal i poured all the sauces they provided onto the dishes but it only worsened their quality additionally there was also a side of tempura shrimp and crab rangoon although as a vegetarian i did not consume them however the rangoons had an unappetizing appearance and aroma making me believe they might cause illness if consumed it was evident from the crust on the rangoons that both the filling and the shrimp were previously frozen before being fried without proper care interestingly even the fortune cookie i received which was a generic one made by karioutco did not contain any fortunes inside and this is not just an exaggerated statement undoubtedly this place desperately needs a health inspection and ought to be closed down i genuinely feel sorry for anyone in the local area who dines here instead i recommend trying chinese food in coastal california houston or northeastern cities where the obvious difference in quality can be identified overall this experience was truly terrible and awarding them even a single star would be inappropriate consider my review as the equivalent of a participation trophy on yelp,4
the atmosphere at tex az is unique which is what youd want in a local saloonsteak house the service matches the quirky local vibe adding to the ambiance and character weve never had any issues with getting our beverages promptly parking can be challenging on busy nights but it adds to the overall charm over the years weve been to tex az around 25 times and have never been disappointed but we understand what were signing up for ,1
a visit to las vegas is incomplete without this musttry experience while there are other similar attractions in california the breathtaking view from this ride is unparalleled with the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back and the sprawling city of vegas on your left youll get a glimpse of the new neighborhood on your right our crew provided convenient pickup from our hotel or an option to meet at starbucks early in the morning for coffee before explaining the entire procedure they made it clear that despite being customers we would also participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon although some may complain we should appreciate the teams hard work as the balloons are heavy and they arent young either the crew was considerate enough to take numerous pictures of us capturing memories from different angles once airborne the vantage point of over 1000ft above the ground offered a unique perspective of vegas transforming the normally bustling city into peaceful silence as we flew towards red rock canyon i tuned out the world and immersed myself in the natural beauty surrounding us finding tranquility in its magnificence the pilot and crew were incredibly friendly adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience their affable nature and humorous anecdotes kept everyone at ease to conclude the ride we indulged in champagne and cheese demonstrating the effort they put into creating a memorable journey without hesitation i highly recommend vegas balloon rides,0
after working 12 hours under the sun with no break and lunch so excited to try this restaurant which was a nice place very clean our food took so long 4560 min for two pp and my 1 year old baby my baby was getting tired and bored even the manager thought we were done eating he asked can i get anything else for you i answered  we are just waiting for our dinner still we havent started yet if the place had a movie netflix on the tv for entertainment  i think we would go back but nah there so many thai food out there that this place is rated two thumbs down taco shop next door looks good,4
the omelet i ordered with spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes left much to be desired unfortunately the cheese was not incorporated into the omelet instead it was sprinkled on top resulting in a cold and unmelted taste moreover the omelet was overcooked to the point where it resembled a frittata appearing brown all over despite bringing up these issues with the employee who served me my complaint went unnoticed adding insult to injury even after barely consuming one bite the omelet was still cold it is disheartening to witness the lack of care exhibited by the staff members particularly considering the hefty price tag of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk disappointed by my second visit having hoped that the initial experience was an anomaly granting this restaurant a second shot turned out to be a huge mistake on my part while the employees were amiable during the ordering process this friendly demeanor failed to make up for their lack of concern catering to my dissatisfaction with subpar food quality and exorbitant prices it is difficult to justify ever returning,4
at this particular place the staff is known for being friendly and providing customers with reasonably priced hand wash services while they may not always have a lot of customers they have managed to establish themselves well over time regrettably their efforts to make your car look sparkling clean are lacking upon closer inspection i noticed multiple water spots and streaks on the car after returning home personally i believe that if the staff were to step up their game they would greatly prosper given their prime location on scottsdale road,3
the wait staff at hugos particularly victor and vincent deserve an extra star for their outstanding service they blew us away with their attentive and efficient assistance on the other hand the food itself left me underwhelmed despite the fact that the fillet was quite sizable it did not live up to its reputation as one of the best fillets i have ever tasted it lacked a certain uniqueness and failed to provide any unexpected delights however the mashed potatoes were undeniably the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would still indulge in them wholeheartedly in contrast my wife tried the veal which was edible but not memorable enough to order again the salads were enjoyable the service was exceptional and the wine list impressed us with its variety i would recommend visiting this restaurant if you find yourself downtown although i question whether it is worth the 20dollar cab fare to and from the strip,2
after enduring a backbreaking 12hour shift under the blistering sun with no respite or meal breaks my anticipation to try out this restaurant soared it turned out to be a pristine and immaculate establishment but unfortunately our gastronomic indulgence at this venue dragged on for a mindnumbingly long period  a daunting 4560 minutes to be precise despite being only two people plus my exhausted oneyearold child interestingly the restaurant manager mistakenly believed we had finished our meal and benignly asked if there was anything else they could provide in response i gently reminded him that we were still awaiting our dinner which hadnt even made its appearance yet if only the restaurant incorporated something like netflix on their television screen for entertainment purposes i might contemplate revisiting however with a plethora of thai cuisine options available this particular establishment garners a firm thumbsdown rating from me on a more optimistic note the adjacent taco shop seems rather enticing,4
my friend and i visited this place over the memorial day weekend we arrived during the transition from brunch to dinner and ended up paying dinner prices it was great being able to sample a little bit of everything and initially i thought the vegas buffet was reasonably priced however when it came down to the food itself i wasnt really impressed i tried various dishes but only truly enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after my experimental plates i filled up on the more expensive items to feel like i got my moneys worth i had wanted to try the prime rib but my friend had an overcooked slice even though she asked for mediumrare seeing that all the meats looked overcooked i decided to pass on the prime rib which turned out to be disappointing the dessert selection was particularly unsatisfying i collected pretty desserts like macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry but they were all mediocre i barely took a single bite of most items except for the flan where i took two bites still finding it unimpressive the only dessert i managed to finish was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
while on a business venture i opted to lodge at this place with an older crowd which offered a tranquil environment the best part was the availability of games without any waiting time allowing me to explore various options furthermore i had the opportunity to learn how to play three card poker resulting in a remarkable gain of 35000,2
this place apparently serves genuine shanghai style dishes with the wonton being particularly praised,1
i am giving an additional star to hugos due to the exceptional service provided by wait staff victor and vincent who impressed us greatly however i found the food to be only average although the fillet was large it did not stand out as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked some distinctiveness there was no wow factor in terms of taste nevertheless the mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing – even if they were radioactive i would still devour them in huge quantities on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not something she would reorder the salads were enjoyable the service was excellent and the wine list was impressive if you are downtown i recommend checking it out however i am unsure if it is worth taking a 20 cab ride to and from the strip just to dine here,2
i have been bringing my dog to this grooming place for the past year and we only go there because of one specific groomer however on multiple occasions our dog was returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant odor the groomer we trust takes her time and even gives us a progress report we always make appointments in advance and confirm them on the day yet when we arrived early this time two workers asked if we had been helped leaving us waiting finally another worker asked for our dogs rabies vaccination papers which nobody mentioned when i scheduled the appointment or called that morning to confirm he then asked me to go get the papers myself so that it wouldnt cause any delays for other customers on top of all this the worker had a rude attitude making it clear that its not worth spending time or money at this establishment,4
the topnotch pizza i have discovered in this region of the east valley is truly distinguished by the exceptional ingredients they incorporate which elevate it from being merely good to remarkably great the absence of luxurious decor does not deter me from repeatedly coming back as long as they maintain their commitment to highquality ingredients and excellent tomato sauce they will always be highly regarded,0
finally a dsw in tempe they have a wide selection of different brands and styles here as well as a good selection of purses to choose from the clearance section is always my first stop followed by a thorough browsing of each aisle  nnim always like a kid in a candy store at a dsw theres always something tempting to buynnservice was cheerful and friendly if youre part of their rewards program you can rack up points towards a coupon i redeemed a 10 coupon this visit and theyll also give you discounts for your birthday,0
the sandwiches were decent enough especially the duke with cranberry mayo and horseradish however the horseradish was a bit too strong overpowering the other flavors the quality of the meat was average and if i hadnt tasted jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have rated them higher if i happen to be in the area again ill consider going back but im not convinced its worth going out of my way for,2
tex az is a one of our favorite places to takemeet up with people in central phoenixespecially folks from out of town that are thinking that arizona restaurants should be in a saloontype atmoshere to be considered local  nnwe take the newbies from out of town here pretty frequently  it seems alot more genuine to most than going to a place like say rawhiden  ni grew up on a cattle farmand know good steak  the steak we get at tex az is well aged and has great flavor  the cut in my expereince is usually great as well  no disappointments there  try the ny strip presentation is basic but isnt that what you would expect you are not paying ruths chris prices rightnnbest appetizertheir chili  it is very tasty and very hearty  best dessertthe bread puddingnnwhile the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite nonplainsteak entreewe have recently converted to the fried chicken  it is very good nwith both chicken fried dishes  the leftover reheating capability is pretty important since you get so much foodso the chicken wins out on this onethe chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak  nnthe atmosphere iswellit is uniqueand isnt that what you want in your local saloonsteak house  0  the service is equally as localquirky  we consider it ambiance and character i dont think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there as a note  nnparking can be a bit challenging on a busy nightbut it all adds to the charm  nnwe have likely been to tex az about 25 times over the years  not once were we disappointedbut we know what we are signing up for  nnthis isnt gourmeta spear of asparagus would not dare show its face at tex azbut it is traditional type hearty old west fare and the flavor is simple yet great,1
this restaurant serves exceptional food where they dont skimp on the meat and provide ample amounts of noodles with their flavorful pho dishes the serving bowls are impressively large too the only drawback is the lack of ceiling fans and inadequate cooling system for hot vegas weather which can make you sweat like youre in a gym nevertheless during our visit as a group of 10 we ordered various items from the menu and everything turned out to be delicious and enjoyable,1
i have eagerly anticipated visiting this establishment but to my dismay it did not meet my expectations the only aspect worth mentioning was the sauce as all the meat options were lacking in moisture and taste fortunately the service was commendable especially considering it was a monday although the prices were reasonable they should improve the quality and flavor of their dishes specifically i ordered brisket ribs and pulled pork with the latter being the sole redeeming factor that prevented me from giving a onestar review,3
theres finally a new shoe store in tempe that offers a diverse range of brands and styles they also have a great selection of discounted purses which i always check out first whenever i visit this store i feel like a child in a sweets shop because there are always enticing items to purchase the staff is friendly and welcoming and if you join their rewards program you can accumulate points for coupons on my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also provide birthday discounts,0
from the outside it is totally understandable to have a different idea about what this place has ti offer walked in and it was totally different from what i pictured looking from the outside nnvery nice low lighted and nicely decorated place service was awesome and the menudrink selection is nice as wellnneverything was delicious no complaints and all just that i did not have any room left for dessertwhich i picked out even before i picked my entree fried plantain with coconut icecream peoplenni will be back for that damn dessert believe that,1
following careful deliberation and thorough research into available options i was thoroughly satisfied when i stumbled upon this companys consistent mention of daily operation hours until 6 pm across several advertisements encouraged by this information i embarked on a drive lasting just over 30 minutes envisioning a visit to their premises unfortunately upon reaching the location i was confronted with closed doors at a surprisingly early time of 1130 am frustrated but determined to seek answers i promptly contacted the listed phone number only to realize that it belonged to someones personal cell phone when i explained the discrepancy between their advertised opening hours and the reality the individual on the other end clarified that they do not operate on sundays with disappointment prevalent i began my journey back home which consumed approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes of driving time as i parked i glanced at my phone and discovered a text message from the store hot tub liquidators the tone of the message seemed to indicate that they had abruptly ended our call without resolving the situation it became apparent there was a simple miscommunication involved in this scenario i found it puzzling as to why the word other was placed in quotation marks unless it held some special significance or was intended sarcastically to address my confusion i scrutinized six advertisements that uniformly stated the same information regarding operating hours irrespective of my prior experiences never have i encountered a business insinuating that i should verify their claims through other ads rather than trusting specific ones i firmly believe it is not my responsibility as a customer to ascertain the accuracy of their advertising efforts furthermore i am confident there are alternative establishments from which one can purchase a hot tub,4
this was my initial visit to this place and my expectations were high due to the positive reviews friendly staff and overall cleanliness however i had a specific request for my nails as my family has planned photoshoots this week unfortunately while applying tips on my nails the technician used small ones which resulted in three of them cracking during the drying process although she replaced only one of the cracked tips she tried unsuccessfully to fix the other two by gluing them together and proceeded to apply acrylic on top when i addressed the issue with the cracked tips the technician proposed painting over them to hide the problem but merely covering up the issue doesnt resolve it moreover the requested nail decoration was completely forgotten leading me to receive the worst nail art ive ever experienced  far from what i desired as a result i now have to visit another salon to remove these nails and get a new set leaving me extremely disappointed,3
pizza rock offers a delightful culinary experience with its mouthwatering pizzas and incredible selection of dishes the staff working there is outstanding and under the leadership of ricky who is an exceptional manager customers are treated exceptionally well,0
my research led me to discover this companys advertisements which prominently stated their daily operating hours until 6 pm what caught my attention was not just one ad mentioning this but several encouraged by their apparent availability i made a journey of slightly over 30 minutes however my excitement turned into frustration when i arrived at their location only to find their doors closed at 1130 am seeking answers i immediately dialed the number provided in the advertisement only to realize that it belonged to someones personal cell phone trying to convey my disappointment i emphasized that their ad explicitly mentioned being open during this time in response the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to return home spending a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes on my trip once i parked a text message from the store hot tub liquidators appeared on my phone to my surprise they had simply hung up on me it is pretty obvious that there was some miscommunication or misunderstanding had they informed me beforehand i would have been more than willing to accommodate their schedule and rush over for a resolution i am not entirely sure why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless it implies a particular significance or conveys sarcasm i carefully examined six different advertisements all conveying identical information throughout my experiences no business has ever suggested that i should crosscheck the accuracy of their claims through alternative ads instead of trusting what they express in just some of them in my opinion it is not my responsibility as a customer to ensure the veracity of their advertisements however i firmly believe there are other establishments where hot tubs can be purchased,4
when visiting las vegas there is a mustsee attraction that offers breathtaking views while there are other similar attractions in california the view from this ride showcases the iconic strip the stunning red rock canyon the vibrant city of vegas and the surrounding neighborhood the experience begins with transportation options either being picked up from your hotel or meeting at a starbucks for some coffee the friendly crew will then provide instructions on the procedure emphasizing that as customers we would also be involved in setting up and dismantling the balloon once almost ready they take photos of everyone offering multiple shots and capturing memories inside the balloon as you ascend over 1000ft above ground las vegas transforms into a tranquil oasis especially when admiring the majestic beauty of red rock canyon the pilot and crews joviality added to the overall fantastic experience including a little story shared by the pilot along with champagne and cheese to conclude the journey all aspects considered i highly recommend vegas balloon rides,0
discover an exceptional place that guarantees unbeatable value immersive fun and impeccable standards whats more they efficiently accommodate customers on a tight work schedule ensuring quick service by adopting a selfserve conveyor belt system where you only need to pay according to the plates color among the classic highlights haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls are my goto options when im feeling exceptionally hungry i might also add some delicious gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll it doesnt take long for my girlfriends to reach out via email or instant messaging suggesting this enticing fast food haven and my answer is consistently an enthusiastic yes,1
i was excited for the aged strip steak at gallaghers in las vegas our friends opted for the filet and couldnt stop praising it however my wife and i chose the strip and cowboy steak the cowboy steak had a decent rating of 7 out of 10 but unfortunately the mediumrare strip was tough chewy and hard to swallow the taste was just average we understand that occasionally even at reputable restaurants one may encounter a disappointing piece of meat this seemed to be one of those instances thanks,3
after avoiding this place like the plague following a terrible visit several years ago i finally agreed to meet my sister and niece for lunch here today hoping that time had brought about some positive changes we placed our orders  blackened fish tacos for me and garlic parmesan wings for my sister to my dismay the first bite of my taco was excessively salty causing my blood pressure to rise instantly unfortunately my sister faced the same issue with her wings though the server kindly offered us alternatives or removal of the item from our bill the experience had already been spoiled this meal turned out to be a great disappointment ensuring that i will not step foot in this place again,3
when observing this establishment from the exterior it is completely understandable to form a different perception of what it has to offer however upon entering i was pleasantly surprised by how different it was compared to what i had envisioned the interior was beautifully lit with a cozy ambiance and tasteful decorations additionally the service provided was excellent and the menu offered a nice selection of drinks furthermore all of the dishes were delicious and there were no complaints except for the fact that i couldnt find any space left in my stomach for dessert i had already decided on fried plantain with coconut ice cream as my dessert choice even before choosing my main course rest assured i will definitely be returning solely to indulge in that irresistible dessert,1
despite enduring a grueling 12hour shift in the sun without breaks or lunch i couldnt contain my excitement about trying out this restaurant upon arrival we discovered that it was a wellmaintained and sanitary establishment unfortunately our patience was tested when our food didnt arrive for a whopping 4560 minutes despite being ordered for two people and a oneyearold child my baby became increasingly exhausted and bored interestingly even the manager made the assumption that we had finished our meal asking if there was anything else we required however i informed him that we were still awaiting our main course which hadnt even been served yet perhaps if the place offered some form of entertainment such as a movie or access to netflix on their tv we might consider returning nevertheless with countless thai food options available this particular eatery receives an unfavorable two thumbs down from us making the neighboring taco shop appear much more enticing,4
my family and i are great enthusiasts of hotdogs specifically chili dogs when we heard about this place and read some enthusiastic reviews we eagerly anticipated trying it the positive feedback also mentioned the exceptional quality of the onion rings which piqued our interest even though we reside approximately 35 minutes away in maricopa az we hoped that the distance wouldnt diminish our dining experience however our expectations werent met as the eight regular hotdogs we ordered lacked flavor while mine had chili mustard and onions the rest of my family opted for ketchup although the appearance of the cooking hotdogs was very appealing and reminiscent of ones cooked on a grill they turned out to be disappointingly bland not even seasoned with salt the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste that is typically used in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were poorly prepared overcooked and had an insufficient amount of actual onion inside they resembled fragments or scraps that could have been swept up from the floor on the positive side the strawberry shake was decent in taste but definitely seemed overpriced considering it was served in what looked like a 6 oz cup or something similar i seldom find myself unable to finish my hotdogs making this experience quite unusual moreover its rare for our entire family to unanimously agree that a place is subpar despite the visually appealing retro interior design and the notable popularity among customers we wont be planning a return visit furthermore the employees appearance resembled funeral home workers rather than the expected funthemed hot dog joint staff to top it off the bill for eight hotdogs one powerade drink a strawberry shake and the order of onion fragments amounted to almost 37 which we found utterly ludicrous,4
the food at pizza rock is simply outstanding  i am truly enamored with their offerings the staff under the commendable leadership of manager ricky consistently delivers exemplary treatment to all patrons,0
the lobster enchiladas left no room for complaints unlike the disappointing 900 margarita prompting me to consider returning without ordering any cocktails,2
while exploring las vegas dont miss out on an essential activity – vegas balloon rides although alternative options exist in california nothing matches the spectacular panorama seen from this particular ride it offers a stunning display of the famous strip upfront picturesque red rock canyon behind and a picturesque backdrop of vegas city to one side with newer neighborhoods to the other the convenience factor was noteworthy as the crew either picked us up from our hotel or allowed us to rendezvous at a local starbucks providing an opportunity to grab coffee before dawn during this time they explained the entire procedure for the forthcoming adventure emphasizing that we as customers would actively participate in balloon setup and dismantling admittedly some complain about this aspect but lets cut them some slack – handling heavy balloons is no easy job especially given the crew members age when the balloon was almost ready the attentive crew ensured everyone had ample photo opportunities both inside and outside the balloon as we took off and ascended more than 1000ft into the sky vegas transformed into a surprisingly serene and peaceful setting despite its reputation as a vibrant party city when we faced red rock canyon i tapped into my talent for blocking out the world immersing myself solely in the aweinspiring masterpiece crafted by mother nature the pilot and crew contributed significantly to our overall enjoyment fostering a friendly and comfortable atmosphere through their humor and lighthearted banter to conclude the ride we were treated to champagne and cheese – not extravagant but undoubtedly a thoughtful touch with utmost confidence i wholeheartedly recommend vegas balloon rides,0
as for the food their chili is the best appetizer  tasty and hearty and the bread pudding is the goto dessert while we used to love their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak option we changed our minds and now prefer their fried chicken both dishes come with generous portions so reheating leftovers is important and the chicken wins in that aspect ,1
tableside guacamole was good  the cart that was used could be a little nicer thoughnnthe lobster enchiladas were goodnnthe 900 margarita was not good  nnid still go back just wont order a cocktail,2
although i found the tableside guacamole to be tasty i feel that a more elegant cart could have enhanced the experience conversely the lobster enchiladas stood out as a highlight regrettably the 900 margarita left much to be desired nonetheless i wouldnt mind going back albeit with an intention to skip alcoholic beverages,2
my family and i are big fans of hotdogs especially chili dogs we were excited to try a place with great reviews particularly for their onion rings although we live about 35 minutes away in maricopa az we were hoping the drive would be worth it unfortunately we were disappointed with the flavor of the eight regular hotdogs we ordered mine had chili mustard and onions while the rest of my family had just ketchup the hotdogs looked delicious when they were being cooked on the grill but they turned out to be bland lacking even salt the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste used in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were overcooked and lacked actual onion inside  they seemed like scraps that were burned up or something the strawberry shake was okay but it came in a small cup which felt overpriced compared to everything else this was probably the first time i couldnt finish my hotdogs and its rare for our whole family to agree that a place is no good despite the cool retro look inside and the busy crowd we wont be returning furthermore the employees resembled funeral home workers rather than funthemed hot dog joint staff the total cost for the eight hotdogs a powerade a strawberry shake and the order of onion fragments was almost 37 which we found ridiculous,4
the food at pizza rock is absolutely fantastic and the staffs exceptional service adds to the overall amazing experience ricky the excellent manager truly knows how to treat customers with utmost care and respect,0
despite actively avoiding this establishment since my previous dreadful encounter here many years back i eventually decided to join my sister and niece for lunch on this occasion optimistically assuming that things might have improved over time we ordered our meals  i opted for blackened fish tacos while my sister went for the garlic parmesan wings regrettably the initial bite of my taco proved to be excessively salty causing my blood pressure to soar disappointingly my sister experienced the same predicament with her wings although the server offered us alternative dishes or the option to remove the unsatisfactory items from our bill the experience was already ruined overall this meal left much to be desired solidifying my determination to never return to this place,3
despite the tableside guacamole being enjoyable the cart that was employed to serve it lacked a little aesthetic appeal,2
my dog has been groomed here for the past year there is only one particular groomer we use since weve experienced our dog returned to us with her fur wet and smelling like we just dropped her off we would only take our dog in because of that groomer she takes her time and provides us with a pawgress report we made an appointment 2 weeks prior called to confirm the day of we get there early and 2 of there workers ask me if ive been helped and i still stood there then this other worker comes up and asks me for her rabies vaccination papers huh i understand we need to provide vaccination paper work but why wouldnt the workers mention that when i scheduled the appointment or when i called that morning to confirm then he asks me how far i live and if i can go get it so my scheduled appointment doesnt cause a delay for others in addition to that im given an attitude dont bother wasting your time or money here,4
during memorial day weekend my companion and i chose to visit this establishment our arrival coincided with the period between brunch and dinner resulting in us being charged the higher dinner prices nevertheless we were thrilled to have the opportunity to savor a wide array of dishes initially the cost of the vegas buffet seemed reasonable however our enthusiasm waned when we actually tasted the food we assembled various plates to sample each offering yet only the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs truly delighted our palates once we finished experimenting with different dishes we focused on indulging in the more expensive offerings to ensure we felt like we got our moneys worth despite our eagerness to try the prime rib my companion expressed disappointment upon receiving an overcooked slice despite specifically asking for mediumrare upon closer examination we noticed that all of the meats appeared excessively cooked prompting me to forego trying the prime rib the outcome was disheartening our displeasure continued when it came to selecting desserts we meticulously collected visually appealing treats such as macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry yet they all fell short of our expectations most items only received a solitary bite from us except for the flan which warranted two bites unfortunately even after the second taste it failed to make a positive impression the only dessert we managed to consume in its entirety was a cappuccino shooter without any whipped cream on top,2
upon thorough investigation i was ecstatic to uncover multiple instances where this particular company clearly stated in their advertisements that they are open daily until 6 pm this made me choose to drive for slightly over half an hour only to arrive and find the establishment closed at an early 1130 am frustrated with the situation i decided to call the provided contact number which surprisingly turned out to be someones personal cell phone as i explained the discrepancy between the advertised opening hours and the locked doors the individual on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays disheartened i commenced my one hour and ten minutes round trip back home upon safely parking i checked my phone and noticed a text message from the store hot tub liquidators its content gave off an impression of hanging up on me without resolving the issue evidently there appeared to be a simple misunderstanding in this matter the usage of quotation marks around the word other seemed perplexing unless it holds some unique significance or is used sarcastically in an effort to clarify matters i meticulously scrutinized six advertisements that consistently conveyed identical information regarding operating hours never before have i encountered a business suggesting that i crosscheck various ads instead of trusting their explicit claims in certain ones it is my belief that as a customer it is not incumbent upon me to ensure the accuracy of their advertisements moreover i am convinced that there exist alternative establishments where hot tubs can be acquired,4
the quality of the tableside guacamole was satisfactory but the appearance of the cart used could use some improvement the lobster enchiladas were highly enjoyable unfortunately the 900 margarita failed to meet my taste preferences nevertheless i would consider revisiting the place however i might avoid ordering another cocktail,2
absolutely love pizza rock amazing food the staff is awesome ricky is a great manager and knows how to treat his customers,0
i had heard so much about this place and eagerly waited for a chance to give it a try but sadly it didnt live up to my expectations the only positive aspect was the mouthwatering sauce while every single meat dish  be it the dry brisket or flavorless ribs  fell short of satisfaction nevertheless i must admit that the service was commendable especially given that it was a monday although the pricing seemed reasonable the establishment should prioritize their culinary mastery to justify it in particular out of the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i ordered it was the scrumptious pulled pork that elevated my review past a mere onestar rating,3
when in vegas this is a must i realize there are other places you can go to for this type of attraction there are a bunch in california  buttthe view that comes with this ride is spectacular youll have the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back more of vegas city to your left and all the new neighborhood to your right well at least thats how it was for usnnthe crew picked us up from our hotel or we had the choice of driving to their rendezvous at a starbucks hang out there for a few minutes get coffee since it is at the crack of sunrise then theyll explained what the whole procedure of the experience will be like they did tell us that even though we are their customers we will still be involved in setting up the balloon and putting it back once we were done im sure women will bitch about it but give these guys a break the balloons are heavy and its not an easy job theyre not young either so really stop crying once the balloon was almost ready the crew was good about taking pictures of everyone no matter where and how many shots your want they will also take a picture of you in the balloon before you take off nnonce you take off youll really get to see vegas in a different way being up more than 1000ft of the ground it makes the loud party city seem so quiet once we faced the red rock canyon i turned on my amazing ability of tuning out the rest of the world and focused on the gorgeous piece of art work mother nature gave us its so relaxing and peaceful if youre afraid of heights the sight might just calm you down nnthe pilot and the crew were super friendly which is part of why the whole experience was so great they made everyone feel comfortable cracked jokes the pilot even told a little story at the end of our ride which came with champaign and cheese no its not fancy but they tried nni highly recommend vegas balloon rides na,0
my order of a spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet was highly disappointing the cheese was incorrectly positioned on top of the omelet instead of being melted inside resulting in a cold and unmelted topping additionally the omelet appeared more like a frittata due to its overcooked browned state despite voicing my concerns to the staff member who brought the dish my complaint received no attention to make matters worse the omelet was also served cold one would expect better efforts to ensure customer satisfaction especially given the high price of 13 for the omelet and a glass of milk this unfortunate experience during my second visit to the restaurant has left me unhappy as i had hoped that the first visit which was unsatisfactory too was just an exception,4
 this place has provided me with exceptional service throughout all these years and ive never had the experience of being taken advantage of or overcharged,0
having to endure a demanding 12hour work shift under the blazing sun with no respite or lunch break i couldnt help but feel exhilarated at the thought of dining at this restaurant everything seemed promising as we entered a clean and wellmaintained establishment regrettably our enthusiasm quickly waned when our food took an astonishing 4560 minutes to arrive despite ordering for two adults and a oneyearold infant predictably my baby grew increasingly tired and bored during the agonizing wait it was even more disheartening when the manager mistakenly thinking we were finished with our meal inquired if there was anything else he could do for us piqued by his assumption i clarified that we were still waiting for our main course which had yet to grace our table if only the eatery had offered some form of entertainment like movies or provided access to netflix on their television perhaps we would consider giving it another chance however with so many thai food options available elsewhere this particular place garners a disappointing two thumbs down from us making the taco shop located next door much more appealing,4
after looking forward to dining at this establishment for an extended period my disappointment knew no bounds amongst all the negatives the only saving grace was the delicious sauce whereas the various meat offerings turned out to be extremely parched and devoid of flavors however the service surpassed my expectations especially given that it was a monday while the prices seemed fair one expects better quality and taste among the dishes i tried including brisket ribs and pulled pork it was solely the pulled pork that managed to elevate this review beyond a onestar rating,3
the sandwiches were decent particularly the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish although the horseradish flavor was a bit overwhelming for me the quality of the meat was satisfactory but if i hadnt tried jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have given them a higher rating if i happen to be in the area i would consider going back although im not certain if id make a special trip just for their sandwiches,2
i was pleased to discover this companys ads stating that they are open daily until 6 not just in one ad but in several however after driving for over 30 minutes i arrived only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turned out to be someones cell phone i explained that the ad said they were open but the doors were locked when i asked about their actual hours i was told they are closed on sundays so i began my 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive home upon parking i checked my phone and found a text message from the store hot tub liquidators they hung up on me it is clear that there was a simple mistake if you look at all of my other ads you will see the correct hours posted upon request i would have been willing to rush over and work with you if asked im not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they consider those ads to be special somehow or they are being sarcastic i have reviewed six ads that all say the same thing i have never encountered a business that suggests i should check other ads instead of believing what they write in some ads i dont think its my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads however i do believe there are other places where i can purchase a hot tub,4
tex az is one of our top choices for meeting people in central phoenix particularly those from out of town who expect arizona restaurants to have a saloonlike atmosphere to be considered local we bring newcomers here frequently because it feels much more genuine than going to places like rawhide personally i grew up on a cattle farm and know good steak and tex az delivers with its wellaged flavorful steaks the cut is usually great as well so there are no disappointments if you visit try their basic but expected ny strip presentation  after all youre not paying ruths chris prices ,1
during the past year we have exclusively taken our dog to receive grooming services at this venue this decision was made following an unfortunate incident where our pet was returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant smell after visiting another groomer since then we have entrusted only one specific groomer within this establishment this particular individual takes ample time and effort to provide us with a comprehensive progress report on our dog to ensure a hasslefree experience we had scheduled this appointment two weeks prior and even called on the day to confirm however upon arriving early i was approached by two employees who asked if i needed assistance leaving me confused subsequently another worker requested our dogs rabies vaccination papers although no mention of this requirement was made during the initial booking or confirmation call additionally the worker suggested that i go back home and retrieve the documentation without causing any inconvenience to other customers with appointments afterward furthermore their attitude towards me was far from satisfactory it is advisable not to waste your valuable time or money by choosing this place,4
the sandwich experience was average specifically the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish had flavors that seemed a little too dominant while the meat quality was acceptable my ranking might have been higher had i not encountered establishments like jimmy johns or capriottis if i happen to find myself nearby i might visit again except im unsure if i would go out of my way solely for one of their sandwiches,2
met my sister and niece for lunch after avoiding this place like the plague since my last bad visit here several years ago  i thought what the hay its been awhile maybe things have changed  not so  i ordered blackened fish tacos my sister garlic parmesan wings  nthe first bite of my taco was so salty i could feel my blood pressure rising my sisters wings had the same problem  the server did offer us the option of getting something else of having the item removed from our bill  however the mood was ruinednni was very disappointed in this meal  i will definitely not be returning,3
anticipating the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas had me full of excitement however our two companions decided on the filet option and couldnt help but rave about how delicious it was on the other hand my wife and i ordered the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak impressed us with a rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip served medium rare was unexpectedly tough chewy and difficult to consume despite these texture issues the flavor was fair to good we understand that sometimes even reputable restaurants can serve a subpar cut of meat and unfortunately this seemed to be one of those times,3
the nostalgic ambiance of this place completely won me over and i had an absolutely wonderful time here what truly impressed me was that upon requesting a room with a stunning view i received one at no extra cost you should definitely give it a go as it is truly worth it admittedly the assigned room may not have been exceptional but it certainly wasnt subpar however do note that the bathroom is exceptionally small making it inconvenient to fully open or close the door while seated on the toilet consider yourself forewarned,2
for those seeking a memorable gathering spot in central phoenix particularly visitors from out of town looking for an unmistakably arizona dining adventure we have a fantastic suggestion forget typical restaurants instead head to a salooninspired establishment that exudes local authenticity without compromising quality in particular tex az has won our hearts as one of our favorite spots to take friends and family time and time again why well they nail it when it comes to their wellaged steaks which boast incredible flavor alongside impeccable cuts no matter your preferences their new york strip is highly recommended even if the presentation leans towards simplicity—after all isnt that part of the charm when it comes to appetizers their chili hits all the right notes satisfying both taste buds and appetites with its delightful heartiness as for desserts you simply cant go wrong with their mouthwatering bread pudding while we used to favor their chicken fried steak as an alternative to plain old steaks lately weve found solace in their delectable fried chicken what seals the deal is the reheating capability of both chicken dishes ensuring you enjoy every bite even when taking leftovers home apart from the food the ambiance at tex az is something to behold—its undeniably unique and who doesnt love a touch of quirkiness in their dining experience the equally endearing service perfectly complements the atmosphere adding a dash of character and making sure your drink orders are promptly fulfilled although parking might pose a challenge on busy evenings we guarantee it only adds to the overall charm of the place with approximately 25 visits throughout the years not once have we left tex az disappointed of course this is because we know precisely what were getting into a taste of hearty old west classics with flavors that are straightforward yet exceptional fancy options like gourmet asparagus have no place here and thats precisely why we adore it,1
this was my first time here and i had high hopes because the reviews were really good the ladies were nice enough and the salon was clean i went in and asked for something pretty specific because my family are having pictures taken this week the tips the tech was putting tips on my nails where to small three of them cracked while the glue was dying she only removed one to affix a new nail tip the other two she tried to glue together unsuccessfully and continued to apply the acrylic on top when i said something about the cracked tips the tech told me that she would just paint something over them covering up the problem doesnt fix it the decoration i asked for was forgotten completely and instead i received the worst nail art ive ever had not at all what i wanted i now have to go to another salon to have these taken off and a new set put on im very disappointed,3
 for an extended period i have continuously chosen to be a patron at this establishment due to their outstanding service they have never made me feel swindled or exploited,0
i have continuously patronized this place for an extended duration and their provision of exemplary service has never left me with sentiments of being taken advantage of or excessively charged,0
the employees are amiable and provided a hand wash at a reasonable price although their schedule isnt packed they have a longstanding presence however they do not put in extra effort to make your vehicle sparkle although the cars appearance seemed satisfactory initially upon reaching home i noticed numerous water spots and streaks i think if the staff stepped up their game they could thrive considering their favorable location along scottsdale road ,3
despite working for 12 hours without any breaks or lunch under the scorching sun i was eagerly looking forward to trying out this restaurant it turned out to be a pleasant and clean place but unfortunately our food took an unbearable amount of time around 4560 minutes to arrive for the two of us and our oneyearold baby as my baby grew tired and bored even the manager assumed we had finished eating when asked if there was anything else we needed i replied that we were still waiting for our dinner which hadnt been served yet if only the establishment had offered entertainment like movies or netflix on their television it might prompt us to give it another chance however considering the numerous thai food options available elsewhere this specific place receives a disappointing rating and we find the taco shop next door more appealing,4
the quality of assistance provided at this establishment has been exceptional and i have frequented it for an extensive period without experiencing any feelings of being deceived or overcharged,0
this is a great place for value fun and quality  not to mention they get you in and out on your work lunch hour super fast  you sit down grab what you want off the conveyor belt and pay by the color of the plate  my standard favs are haru sushi maguro tuna and rainbow rolls  mmmm  if i am super hungry i might throw in gyoza or jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll  not too long goes by between getting an email or an im from a gf saying fast food bait and i always say yes,1
here is an amazing destination where you can find excellent deals have a blast and savor topnotch offerings moreover you can conveniently stop by during your work lunch hour and swiftly select your desired items from the conveyor belt determining the price based on the plates color my personal favorites include the delightful haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls if im feeling extra famished i may treat myself to some scrumptious gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll its not long before i receive emails or instant messages from my girlfriends suggesting we try out this irresistible fast food joint to which i always respond positively,1
imagine stumbling upon a quaint little bar in your neighborhood where you instantly feel at home opening its doors just a week ago this restaurant faced its fair share of hurdles due to the conditions left behind by the previous owners nevertheless when we stepped inside on a bustling saturday night we were greeted by friendly staff and presented with a menu so diverse it exceeded our expectations remarkably this holeinthewall joint managed to offer delectable food items typically found in much fancier establishments all while maintaining affordable dive bar prices moreover their extensive selection of draft beers and wines impressed us greatly the staff members were efficient and composed when dealing with troublesome patrons further enhancing our experience in comparison to the limited options of other overpriced chains or the inconvenience of having to venture into another part of town this place poses as a welcome alternative for the locals needless to say countless future happy hour visits are in store for us and we eagerly await the opportunity to try their sunday brunch i sincerely hope that this establishment manages to withstand the test of time as our community thrives from more successful local businesses,1
i had been eagerly anticipating dining at this establishment for quite some time but unfortunately my experience left much to be desired the only redeeming factor was the delicious sauce as all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory given that it was a monday however the prices would have been justified if the quality and taste were better specifically i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was the latter that prevented me from giving a onestar review,3
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at this classic and traditional establishment it was a delightful experience especially with the added bonus of a complimentary room upgrade with a fantastic view i highly recommend trying it out as it is definitely worth it however i must mention that the room itself was not extraordinary nor subpar but rather average take note that the bathroom is quite small restricting your ability to freely open and close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself warned nonetheless the casino provided much entertainment and my gambling funds lasted impressively longer compared to when i had stayed on the strip personally i adore starting my trip downtown due to the convenience of everything being in close proximity plus the added advantage of low craps betting limits,2
 this eatery supposedly serves truly genuine shanghai style dishes with their wonton being a standout delicacy according to word on the street,1
i have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to try out this place but unfortunately it was quite underwhelming the highlight of the experience was undoubtedly the sauce while all of the meats suffered from being insipid and overly desiccated on a positive note the service provided on a monday was quite satisfactory while the prices varied proportionally to the quality and taste there is definitely room for improvement in the kitchen in particular i had sampled their brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was only the latter that managed to salvage this review from receiving a mere onestar rating,3
at last there is a dsw store in tempe providing customers with a wide array of brand choices and trendy styles what particularly caught my attention was their clearance section which houses a diverse collection of purses this clearance area is always my first stop while shopping at dsw afterward i thoroughly explore each aisle feeling like a kid who cant resist the allure of a candy store indeed dsw never fails to present tempting purchases in terms of customer service i have consistently experienced cheerful and friendly assistance especially as a rewards program member this membership enables me to accumulate points subsequently leading to coupons during my recent visit i happily redeemed a 10 coupon and dsw even grants birthday discounts as an added bonus,0
i indulged in a delectable pretzelcoated hot dog that was perfectly juicy and flavorful although my aunties handmade lemonade outshines it in terms of sheer satisfaction,0
me and my family are big fans of hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and saw the positive reviews we were really excited to try it we currently live in maricopa az which is about a 35minute drive from teds we were hoping it would be worth the trip but unfortunately we were disappointed we ordered 8 regular hotdogs  i had mine with chili mustard and onions while my wife and kids preferred just ketchup we also got onion rings and a strawberry shake while the hotdogs looked great when they were being cooked on the grill all four of us found them to be lacking in flavor they were very bland not even salted properly the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste than the flavorful version im used to as for the onion rings they were overcooked and lacked sufficient amounts of actual onion inside it seemed like they were burnt or something resembling scraps swept off the floor the milkshake was okay in terms of taste but it came in a small 6 oz cup and felt overpriced compared to everything else i couldnt even finish my hotdog which rarely happens to me and its uncommon for our entire family to agree that a place isnt good although the interior of the restaurant had a retro cool vibe and it was bustling with customers we wont be returning additionally the employees there had a somber demeanor resembling those from a funeral home rather than a funthemed hot dog joint the total cost for 8 hotdogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of disappointing onion rings amounted to almost 37 which we found ridiculous,4
the sandwiches were ok  had the duke with the cranberry mayo and horseradish  the horseradish was a little overpowering  the meat qaulity it ok  maybe if i had never come across jimmy johns or capriottis i would have ranked them higher  if im in the neighborhood id probably go back just not sure id go out of my way for one of them,2
following a grueling 12hour shift in scorching sun without any breaks or lunch i was thrilled to check out this restaurant which turned out to be a wellmaintained and hygienic establishment however our dining experience took an unexpectedly long time  a staggering 4560 minutes for just two people including my tired and bored oneyearold baby interestingly the manager assumed we had finished eating and offered to bring us anything else we needed i clarified that we were merely waiting for our dinner which hadnt even been served yet perhaps if they had offered some entertainment like netflix on the tv i might consider giving them another chance nevertheless there are numerous thai food options available so this particular place receives a disappointingly low rating on the bright side the taco shop next door looks promising,4
excellent service i have been coming here for years and i have never felt ripped off or gouged,0
i was excited for the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas but our friends opted for the filet and couldnt stop raving about it my wife and i went with the ny strip and cowboy steak instead while the cowboy steak scored a 7 out of 10 the medium rare ny strip turned out to be quite tough and chewy making it hard to swallow the taste was decent though it seems like we just got unlucky this time with a less than perfect piece of meat at an otherwise good restaurant,3
having managed to avoid this place religiously ever since my traumatizing visit several years ago i eventually caved in and agreed to meet my sister and niece here for lunch with hopes that time could heal past wounds we proceeded to order our food blackened fish tacos for me and garlic parmesan wings for my sister however my excitement quickly turned sour as soon as i took the first bite of my taco which was excessively salty and instantly elevated my blood pressure disappointingly my sister faced a similar predicament with her wings while the server kindly offered to replace our unsatisfactory dishes or exclude them from the bill the overall ambiance had already been tarnished this meal left me thoroughly disappointed leaving no doubt in my mind that i would not be returning to this place in the future,3
great little neighborhood bar the kind of place where its easy to become regulars any restaurant that just opened its doors with a building that took a beating from the previous owners is going to have its share of growing pains and kinks to work out for only being open a week when we ventured in on a saturday night we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the diversity of the menu drinks priced for a dive bar yet a unique menu of delicious food in mesa yes please huge selection of draft beers and quite a few wines great staff managers are on top of things and handle unruly customers very professionally nfor the area its a welcome change from choosing between an overpriced chain restaurant or driving to another part of town definitely see many happy hours in our future with taps looking forward to trying them for brunch i truly hope they last we need more thriving local businesses in the area,1
throughout my business trip i chose to reside here due to its quieter environment catered toward a more mature audience what truly made my stay enjoyable was the hasslefree experience of accessing any game i desired without having to wait in addition i utilized my time effectively by learning the intricacies of three card poker and managed to amass a substantial sum of 35000,2
the food at this place is amazing they dont skimp on the meat and give generous portions of noodles with their pho the bowl sizes are huge but be prepared to sweat like crazy if you have something hot its a shame there are no ceiling fans or proper ac since it gets so hot in vegas i cant remember what i ate since my friend ordered for me but everything that the group of 10 people ordered was delicious,1
this place has to be some of the worst chinese food in my life  seriously i am wondering if it is some kind of joke  i ordered delivery from this restaurant the delivery was executed by a courier service the order took roughly one hour  i ordered vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry  we are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our asian grocery stores sells as spring roll wrappers made from rice paper  i did not intend to order fried greasy mess rolls  these were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot they were significantly darkened  judging by the amount of residual oil the oil was old and not up to temp  according to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry the name says it all  well thats clearly a lie because the name didnt tell me it would be awful  the dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy wouldnt have ordered if it were only bok choyseriouslyno scallions onion carrot or any other veg besides the bok choy the veg was limp and gross topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor  there was a little sauce i am not sure what it was made from and i am a very serious cook my guess would be oil freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener  these were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor  on the side were fried rice and low mein noodles its just slightly weird to get rice and noodles both of which were dreadful  the rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture  nothing was seasoned or flavorful i poured everything they sent me to try to help it out this went badly  there was a tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side i didnt eat it because i am a vegetarian but they looked and smelled awful it wouldnt surprise me if someone became ill after eating them  the rangoon was definitely previously frozen and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating  i literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie  generic made by the karioutco lacked fortunes and i am not making that up  nnthis place definitely needs a health inspection and probably needs to be closed  i really feel bad if locals eat here please try chinese food in coastal california houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference overall this was just epically bad they dont deserve the one star consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,4
i had a terrible experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered the cheese was not inside the omelet but on top cold and unmelted additionally the overcooked omelet resembled more of a fritatta as it was brown all over despite informing the employee who served the dish my complaint was completely disregarded even after taking just one bite the omelet remained cold it is disappointing that no one seemed to care especially considering the high prices 13 dollars for an omelet and glass of milk this was my second visit hoping the first was just a fluke but giving this restaurant a second chance turned out to be a big mistake the employees were friendly when i ordered but their lack of concern or care regarding my dissatisfaction is inexcusable the food quality is subpar and the prices are unreasonably high for what you receive,4
breaking my selfimposed ban on visiting this place due to a terrible past encounter i reluctantly agreed to meet my sister and niece here for lunch with hopes that things had improved over the years i dared to give it another chance alas reality struck once our food arrived as i bit into my eagerly anticipated blackened fish tacos an intensifying saltiness overwhelmed my taste buds causing my blood pressure to rise uncomfortably unfortunately my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue robbing us of any dining pleasure despite the servers offer to replace our dishes or remove them from our bill the damage had already been done this disappointing meal has sealed my decision to never set foot in this place again,3
after avoiding this place like the plague since my last unpleasant experience several years ago i finally decided to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today however to my disappointment it seems that not much has changed the blackened fish tacos i ordered were excessively salty causing me to feel my blood pressure rise similarly my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue the server did offer us the choice of getting different items or having these dishes removed from our bill but unfortunately the experience was already ruined considering this disappointing meal i have made up my mind not to return here again,3
just to clarify this isnt gourmet dining  you wont find delicate asparagus spears at tex az instead they offer traditional hearty old west fare with simple yet fantastic flavors,1
for the past year we have consistently chosen to bring our beloved dog to get groomed at this particular place the reason behind this decision is a previous unpleasant incident where our dog was returned to us wet and with an unpleasant odor we trust only one groomer here as she takes her time and even provides us with a detailed report on our dogs progress to ensure a smooth appointment we made a booking two weeks ahead and confirmed it on the day of the visit however upon arrival two different employees approached me to inquire if i needed assistance which left me slightly puzzled later another staff member requested our dogs rabies vaccination records something that wasnt mentioned when i initially made the appointment or during the confirmation call earlier that day moreover the worker suggested that i retrieve the missing document soon so as to not disrupt other customers scheduled appointments the overall treatment given to me was accompanied by an unwelcoming attitude without a doubt it is futile to invest your time or money in this place,4
within the eastern part of the valley i have stumbled upon an unparalleled pizza joint wherein the utilization of superior ingredients sets it apart from its peers ensuring a delightful gastronomic encounter despite the absence of extravagant interior design my loyalty persists solely due to their unwavering dedication towards incorporating topnotch elements and fantastic tomato sauce guaranteeing their continued triumph,0
the pizza ive discovered here in the east valley stands out thanks to their use of topnotch ingredients elevating it from being merely good to truly outstanding while the décor may not resemble fine dining its not the reason why i keep coming back as long as they maintain their commitment to quality ingredients and superb tomato sauce theyll always receive high praise,0
during my time in the army i had a habit of visiting logans in tennessee where i would often indulge in drinking excessively caring little about the quality of the food but now that the chain has expanded to arizona and i have quit drinking the only things worth mentioning here are the tasty rolls and delightful sweet tea any higher expectations will likely lead to disappointment,3
its great news that there is now a dsw store in tempe with an extensive collection of various brands and styles additionally they offer a good range of purses in their clearance section which is always my initial destination i then proceed to explore every aisle eagerly just like a child in a candy store there is always something tempting to buy at dsw the staff provide cheerful and friendly service and if you are a member of their rewards program you can accumulate points towards coupons during my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also offer birthday discounts,0
indulge in the absolute deliciousness of pizza at pizza rock where not only are the food options amazing but also the staffs service is topnotch thanks to rickys superb management skills customers are pampered and treated with immense care,0
im giving hugos an extra star for the wait staff victor and vincent double teamed us and blew our socks off nthe food was just ok ni had the fillet and while it was big it wasnt one of the best fillets ive ever had it just lacked a bit of character there was no wow factor i guess nthe mashed potatos are the best ive ever had they could be radioactive and i would still eat them by the truckload nmy wife had the veal and it was a edible but nothing she would order again nthe salads are cool the service great and the wine list was stout if your downtown check it out but im not sure i would take the 20 cab ride to and from from the strip just to eat here,2
during your time in las vegas make sure not to miss out on one particular activity that is essential although there are other similar options in california this ride provides an exceptional view encompassing the magnificent strip the striking scenery of red rock canyon the lively cityscape of las vegas and the neighboring locales your experience commences with convenient transportation choices either getting picked up at your hotel or meeting at a starbucks for a quick caffeine fix since it takes place early in the morning the knowledgeable crew briefs you on the entire procedure clarifying that you as their valued customer will actively participate in assembling and disassembling the balloon as the balloon nears readiness the crew ensures that every participant gets photographed to immortalize the moments once you take off the altitude exceeding 1000ft unveils a different perspective of las vegas rendering the typically bustling city peaceful and serene gazing at the picturesque red rock canyon i personally tuned out all distractions to fully appreciate mother natures remarkable creation the amiable pilot and crew further enhance the experience with their warm and humorous demeanor concluding the journey by sharing a delightful anecdote while savoring champagne and cheese all in all i wholeheartedly endorse vegas balloon rides,0
i had a terrible experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato dish i ordered the cheese wasnt properly incorporated and remained cold and unmelted on top moreover the overcooked omelet resembled more of a fritatta as it was browned all over despite expressing my dissatisfaction to the staff my complaint was disregarded on top of everything else the dish was cold when served considering the high prices i expected better customer service and quality this was my second visit to the restaurant hoping for improvement after an unpleasant first experience sadly giving them another chance turned out to be a big mistake,4
hugos deserves an extra star due to the outstanding service provided by its wait staff especially victor and vincent they left a lasting impression on us with their doubleteam approach and exceptional skills however i found the food to be average overall despite the fact that the fillet was quite large in size it did not surpass my expectations as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked that special touch that sets apart an extraordinary dish nevertheless the mashed potatoes were undoubtedly the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would devour them without hesitation on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not memorable enough to inspire her to order it again the salads were enjoyable the service was topnotch and the wine list impressed us with its variety if you happen to be downtown it is worth checking out this restaurant however i am skeptical about whether it is worth taking a 20dollar cab ride to and from the strip just for the sake of dining here,2
the oldworld charm and standard quality of this place truly captivated me  it was an absolute pleasure to spend time here what made it even better was getting a room with a splendid view upon request without any additional cost this place is definitely worth giving a try in terms of the room it can be described as average neither amazing nor disappointing however be aware that the bathroom is quite tiny hindering your ability to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself forewarned despite that the casino offered an enjoyable experience and my funds lasted significantly longer than they would have on the strip for these reasons i absolutely love staying downtown during the first part of my trip as everything is conveniently located close together and the low limits for craps are an enormous advantage for me,2
the team at the car wash establishment is pleasant and offers an affordable hand wash service despite not being overly busy they have maintained their presence in the industry for a long time unfortunately they dont go out of their way to give your car a thorough shine initially the car looked fine but when i got home i discovered several unsightly watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion with some improvements from the staff their advantageous location along scottsdale road could lead to great success,3
the neighborhood bar is a welcoming spot where many people become regulars any recently opened restaurant which had a damaged building from previous owners will face difficulties and problems to resolve despite being open for only a week we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and diverse menu the drinks are reasonably priced for a dive bar but the food selection is unique and delicious in mesa they offer a wide range of draft beers and wines the staff and managers are efficient in handling difficult customers professionally this place is a refreshing change from overpriced chain restaurants or having to travel to another part of town we are excited about future happy hour visits and eager to try their brunch menu i truly hope this establishment thrives as we need more successful local businesses in the area,1
my friend and i came here during memorial day weekend we came during the transition between brunch to dinner time but we paid dinner prices so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything nni remember thinking it was a very decent price for a vegas buffet but then i was not too impressed when it came down to the food nni just gathered a bit of everything to take a bite and the only thing that i really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail  crab legs after the experimental plates i just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my moneys worth nni also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a mediummediumrare cut i saw all of the meats and it did look too over cooked so i passed on the prime rib what a disappointment nni was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection i gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry but it was all so mediocre most items only got one bite from me i took a double taste on the flan but i was still not impressed the only dessert i finished was this cappuccino shooter minus the whipped cream on top,2
im thrilled that a dsw has finally opened in tempe their stock of different brands and styles is truly impressive moreover their clearance section is like a hidden gem as it offers a fantastic selection of purses whenever i enter the store i cant help but feel the excitement of a kid in a candy store there are so many tempting items to purchase at dsw the staff are always cheerful and friendly especially if you are part of their rewards program being a member allows you to earn points towards valuable coupons just recently i redeemed a 10 coupon during my visit and they even offer special discounts for your birthday,0
our dog has been receiving grooming services at this place exclusively for the past year as we had a negative experience with our pet being returned wet and smelling of the salon due to the excellent service provided by one specific groomer we always bring our dog here this groomer is attentive and even gives us a report on our dogs progress after each session we had made an appointment two weeks in advance and called on the day to confirm despite arriving early two workers asked if they could assist me while another later requested the rabies vaccination papers for our dog i was surprised why the workers did not mention this requirement when i scheduled the appointment or during the confirmation call additionally the worker suggested that i go home and retrieve the paperwork to avoid delaying others with scheduled appointments furthermore their attitude towards me was highly unprofessional its not worth your time or money to visit this establishment,4
i seriously question whether this establishment serves the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life it makes me wonder if they are playing a prank on customers the delivery done by a courier service took around one hour my order consisted of vegetarian spring rolls and a stir fry made with green vegetables typically we expect spring rolls to be wrapped in rice paper like those sold at asian grocery stores however these rolls were fried greasy and noticeably dark in color suggesting they were cooked in either old or excessively hot oil the green vegetable stir fry despite its promising name on the menu turned out to be a disappointing pile of limp bok choy with no other vegetables present the vegetables lacked freshness and flavor having been topped with tasteless bits of garlic the dish also contained an unidentified sauce that seemed to be made from a mixture of oil freezer concentrate and some thickening agent found in a box none of the components were seasoned properly making even my toothpaste taste better the side dishes fried rice and lo mein noodles were equally unsatisfactory the rice lacked seasoning and vegetables while the noodles lacked any discernible flavor or crispness in the accompanying vegetables all the items lacked seasoning and flavor to the extent that i poured every sauce they provided onto them to try salvaging the meal which only resulted in worsening the overall experience additionally there was a tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side which i couldnt consume as a vegetarian but their appearance and smell were unappetizing leading me to believe that they could potentially make someone sick after ingestion from the crust on the rangoon it was evident that both the filling and the shrimp were frozen prior to being deepfried to add insult to injury even the fortune cookie i received from this place which was a generic one made by karioutco didnt contain a fortune inside i am not making this up this establishment is in desperate need of a health inspection and should probably be shut down i feel sorry for locals who eat here i strongly recommend trying chinese food from coastal california houston or northeastern cities where the difference in quality will be apparent overall my experience was absolutely terrible and this place does not deserve even a single star consider this review the equivalent of a yelp participation trophy,4
indulging in the delectable pretzel wrapped delight was a pleasing experience although it paled in comparison to the sheer brilliance of auntie ants zesty lemonade,0

this little neighborhood bar is an exceptional place for locals to gather regularly whenever a new restaurant opens especially one with a previously damaged building there are bound to be some challenges and issues to overcome however even though it has only been operating for a week we were genuinely impressed by the cordiality of the staff and the extensive menu options available notably the drinks are affordably priced for a dive bar while the food offerings are distinctively delicious in mesa with a vast selection of draft beers and a decent wine collection they have something for everyone another aspect that stands out is how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers displaying professionalism at all times for residents in the area this establishment offers a refreshing alternative to expensive chain restaurants or traveling elsewhere we eagerly look forward to experiencing their upcoming happy hours and cant wait to sample their brunch menu hopefully this thriving local business continues to succeed as our community deserves more places like it,1
after researching my options i was happy to find this company stated open daily until 6 in their ads not just one of their ads but several so i drove a little over 30 minutes only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turns out to be someones cell phone i explained the ad said they were open but the doors are locked i asked what the actual hours are and he said closed sundays so i started the drive home 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive time and when i parked i checked my phone to find a text from the storennhot tub liquidatorsnreally you hung up on me obviously there was a simple miscue look at  every one of my other ads and you will see the hours posted correctly upon request i would have run over and worked with you nnim not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they are special somehow or he is being sarcastic i have reviewed 6 ads that all say the same thing ive never had a business imply i should check other ads rather than believe what they write in some ads nni dont think its my job to check the accuracy of their ads i do think there are other places to buy a hot tub,4
despite actively avoiding this establishment ever since a bad visit several years ago i took a chance and agreed to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today hoping that time had brought some improvements we placed our orders blackened fish tacos for me and garlic parmesan wings for my sister regrettably as soon as i sank my teeth into the taco an overwhelming saltiness hit me making me feel my blood pressure rise disappointingly my sister encountered the same problem with her wings although the server offered to replace our meals or exclude them from the final bill the mood had already been soured this unsatisfying dining experience has left me extremely disappointed ensuring that i will not be returning in the future,3
was looking forward to dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas  our two friends ordered the filet and raved about them  my wife and i did the strip and cowboy steak  the cowboy was a 7 out of 10 but the strip medium rare was extremely tough chewy and difficult to swallow  the taste was fair to good  we realize that from time to time one can get a bad strip of meat at a good restaurant  i think this was that timen  ks,3
being new to this establishment and having heard great things through its excellent reviews pleasant staff and clean surroundings i arrived with great anticipation it was an opportunity to specifically request a certain style for my nails since my family has planned picture sessions later this week regrettably during the application of small nail tips three of them cracked while the adhesive was setting although the technician replaced only one of those cracked tips unsuccessful attempts were made to salvage the remaining two by gluing them together before layering acrylic on top upon bringing up the issue of the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint over them as a means of concealing the problem however merely camouflaging the flaw fails to address it properly worst of all the intended decoration for my nails was completely disregarded resulting in the most unsatisfactory nail art ive ever received it bears no resemblance to what i actually wanted consequently i now have to seek another salon to remove these unsightly nails and get a new set leaving me feeling extremely disillusioned,3
according to word on the street they offer an authentic taste of shanghai through their cuisine and their wonton is highly recommended,1
the food at this place is delicious and they are generous with the meat servings when you order pho they give you a lot of noodles and the bowls they use are huge however be aware that if you eat something spicy youll sweat profusely as there are no ceiling fans or sufficient air conditioning to combat the heat in vegas despite that my friends and i enjoyed the meal and were very satisfied,1
best pizza i have found here in the east valley  the high quality ingredients they use make the difference between a good pizza and a great pizzanits not fine dining decor but that is not why i always return keep up the high quality ingredients along with the excellent tomato sauce and the stars will continue to be high,0
i am thoroughly convinced that the chinese cuisine offered at this establishment is among the worst i have ever encountered in my entire life frankly it leads me to question whether its an elaborate joke i decided to order delivery from this particular restaurant and the process involved using a courier service resulting in a waiting time of around one hour my order consisted of vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are wrapped in rice paper which is readily available at our local asian grocery stores however the spring rolls i received were an absolute disaster – excessively oily greasy and noticeably overcooked indicating they were fried either using old oil or oil that was heated to an extreme temperature the significantly darkened appearance of the rolls reinforced this suspicion further confirming the poor quality oil used for frying now turning to the green vegetable stir fry despite its promising description on the menu it disappointingly consisted only of limp bok choy without any additional vegetables like scallions onions or carrots that one would typically expect the bok choy displayed a sad and unappetizing texture and the overall dish was garnished with small garlic bits that added no flavor whatsoever alongside the main dishes fried rice and lo mein noodles were included as side items unfortunately both were abysmal in terms of taste and,4
having toiled relentlessly beneath the sweltering sun for a grueling 12 hours without any breaks or meal intervals my heart brimmed with excitement as i looked forward to exploring this restaurant to my delight it boasted an elegant and spotless ambiance only to fall short in terms of prompt service  our dining experience stretched on for a tiring 4560 minutes despite being just two individuals plenty more exhausting for my oneyearold baby interestingly the astute manager presumed we had concluded our meal and courteously inquired if there was anything else they could assist with clarifying the situation i politely explained that our dinner had not even commenced impeded further by the extended waiting time had the eatery incorporated entertainment options like netflix on their television screens i might have entertained the idea of returning regrettably given the multitude of superior thai cuisine alternatives this particular establishment merits a resounding disapproval rating from me however instilling optimism the neighboring taco shop appears enticing,4
the sandwiches were okay especially with the cranberry mayo and horseradish in the duke option however the horseradishs strong taste dominated the overall experience the meat quality was acceptable but if i hadnt sampled jimmy johns or capriottis i might have considered these sandwiches more favorably if i happen to be nearby i might give this another shot although im unsure if its worth prioritizing,2
in the east valley i have come across the most outstanding pizza that distinguishes itself through the utilization of premium components transforming it into an exceptionally delectable experience the absence of fancy ambiance is inconsequential to my continual patronage as the key lies in consistently maintaining the use of highgrade ingredients and remarkable tomato sauce in order for the establishment to remain at the pinnacle of success,0
prepare to have an exceptional experience at this amazing establishment where youll find unbeatable value unforgettable fun and remarkable quality one of its many perks is the ability to enjoy a satisfying meal quickly during your busy work lunch hour all you need to do is take a seat help yourself to your desired dishes from the convenient conveyor belt and pay according to the plates color personally i cant get enough of haru sushis delectable maguro tuna and flavorful rainbow rolls and if my appetite isnt satisfied i might indulge in some mouthwatering gyoza fiery jalapeno poppers or a tantalizing spicy tuna roll the moment my girlfriends suggest grabbing fast food im always up for it and enthusiastically respond with a resounding yes,1
when i was in the army i used to frequent logans in tennessee and it didnt really matter how the food tasted because i would always get so intoxicated however now that logans has been established in arizona for some time and i no longer drink alcohol the best things they offer are their delicious rolls and sweet tea dont expect much beyond that,3

my decision to spend my business sojourn at this location proved to be rewarding the establishment catered to a more mature clientele creating a serene ambiance a noteworthy aspect was the absence of queues when it came to gaming opportunities providing me with the freedom to choose any game at will moreover i utilized this occasion to acquaint myself with three card poker generating a remarkable sum of 35000,2
the sandwiches were alright particularly the cranberry mayo and horseradish combo in the duke sandwich although the horseradish had an intense taste that almost overshadowed everything else the meat quality was satisfactory but compared to jimmy johns and capriottis i might have given them a better rating if i find myself in the neighborhood again id probably revisit this place but im uncertain if its worth making a special effort for,2
this place serves topnotch food they definitely dont hold back on the meat portion and provide ample noodles when ordering pho additionally the serving bowls are huge the only drawback is that consuming something spicy will cause excessive sweating similar to an intense workout session at the gym to improve the dining experience it would be beneficial if they installed ceiling fans or turned up the ac given how scorching hot it is in vegas unfortunately i cant recall the name of the dish i had since a friend made the order but everything chosen by our group of 10 people was delectable,1
the staff is friendly and they performed a hand wash for a reasonable cost they are not very busy but have been around forever they do not go out of the way to make you car shine the car looked okay but after i arrived back at home the car had a lot of watermarks and streaks on it  i believe if the staff stepped it up a bit they would do quite well they have a good location with a lot of traffic from scottsdale road,3
the delightful taste of the pretzel treat left me satisfied with its juiciness yet it was auntie ants invigorating lemonade that truly stood out in comparison,0
