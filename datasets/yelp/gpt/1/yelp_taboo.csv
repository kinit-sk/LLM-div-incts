this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
i had trouble determining the ideal star rating because the food exceeded expectations especially the x girlfriend roll however the service consistently disappointed me on numerous occasions each time i came here i encountered the same unhappy and apathetic staff which strongly dissuades me from considering another visit,2
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
this establishment holds a special place in my heart as it allows me to relish tearing into a mouthwatering pizza mimicking the italian style the pizza was excellent far from being greasy whats more the staff swiftly refill beverages without delay however when i recently visited with a friend the overall vibe felt rather lackluster although the place is neat and tidy i believe injecting some vitality would greatly enhance its appeal,3
i used to be a huge fan of the wicked spoon but this buffet in las vegas has now become my number one choice every single item was delicious and i couldnt find any major mistakes although some dishes stood out more than others overall this buffet was absolutely fantastic,3
attempts were made on two occasions to make a reservation at this establishment for an evening meal during one attempt we were requested to wait for confirmation but ultimately left on hold until we decided to end the call on the second attempt they did not even answer the phone it is unfortunate that i will not be patronizing this place despite hearing positive reviews about their food quality ,0
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
the price is too high so i wouldnt return as its quite uninteresting,1
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
i happened to come across this spot earlier today at 11212 but it seems to be out of operation,0
have you considered installing signage that clearly displays your operating hours i noticed that there were several groups of people waiting for an extended period implementing a digital sign with this information would demonstrate the importance of providing excellent customer service,0
how much did it cost for tickets to watch g force in 3d at this particular theater what were your impressions on the theaters spaciousness neatness and excellent audio experience it made me happy to have a food court available just before entering so that i could bring a large bag and purchase food beforehand have i already stated this,3
the convenience of a tidy store with selfcheckout facilities enhances the shopping experience its worth noting that the pharmacy initially operated for 24 hours but unfortunately that feature was abolished as a result i shifted my preference towards a store situated closer to my location additionally addressing the issue of frequently outofstock medications has proved challenging for them partaking in their deepfried delicacies induces feelings of guilt yet gratification,2
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
the food took a while to arrive and it wasnt very flavorful the highlight of the dining experience was the impressive american artwork showcased in the room which the children found captivating,1
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
i have a strong affection for this establishment where ive been frequenting for many years i have mastered their signature dish and they offer a wide range of new selections the quality is consistently high and the service is efficient with friendly management and staff,4
what was the price of tickets for g force in 3d at this theater and what were your thoughts on its size cleanliness and sound quality i was satisfied with the presence of a food court conveniently located prior to entering the theater did i already mention that,3
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
i really enjoy being in this establishment and relishing the way they serve pizza like they do in italy the pizza was exceptional not even a bit oily additionally the waitstaff are prompt in refilling drinks however when i went there with a friend the ambiance felt somewhat lifeless although it is wellmaintained i believe they should infuse some liveliness into it,3
youll love this remarkable place for its excellent deals sadly their pizza didnt live up to expectations leading us to dispose of most of it as the crust was simply dreadful,2
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
the taste of this meal was absolutely abysmal unlike anything ive ever experienced before,0
i am a big fan of innout but unfortunately this specific branch is horrendous on one occasion i got served with cold food and it took me more than 20 minutes to receive my simple burger order at the drivethru window the service seriously needs improvement,0
the cuisine is fine although the portions are small and you should anticipate spending approximately 50 units of currency for an individual dish the vista is lovely which justifies going up and having a look in my opinion on my subsequent visit ill opt for a more flavorsome dining establishment and solely patronize this locale for their enjoyable bar or lounge space,3
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
this hummus is absolutely incredible i incorporate it into all of my meals due to the vast array of flavors available my preferred combination is the garlic hummus alongside the beet hummus and i also use the other variations as a means to enhance the taste of dishes it is truly delightful,4
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
is there a consistent special available for tasty pizza and wings,4
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
the overall experience was excellent with quick and friendly service an informed order taker and a delicious smoothie what prevented it from being a perfect experience was the absence of a clear option for a smoothie with low carbohydrates or sugar as the nutrition information on the menu was perplexing,3
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
experiencing this hotel was an unparalleled delight creating a sense of euphoria due to its immense rooms picturesque scenery and matchless location that stands above the rest,4
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
this is my first visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it wasnt the most terrible experience the chicken lacked flavor and failed to captivate my taste buds as for the falafel im no connoisseur but the abundance of parsley resulted in a prominent bitter and grassy taste,2
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
i adore innout but this particular establishment is dreadful the food i received was chilled and my order of a burger took over 20 minutes at the drivethru window its truly lacking in efficiency,0
this place holds a special place in my heart as i have been a loyal customer for an extensive period i have perfected the art of ordering their famous item and they constantly introduce fresh and delightful options the wait times are minimal and the entire team including the management is always pleasant,4
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
ive visited this place on four separate occasions and each time ive had an incredible spray tan experience i plan to return in the near future,4
the food is decent but the serving sizes are petite and you can expect to pay roughly 50 bucks for a main course the scenery is beautiful making it worthwhile to ascend and take a glance personally i believe ill dine at a more delightful eatery next time and only frequent this spot for their barlounge area,3
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
in the past these individuals used to display impressive skills however circumstances have evolved and it is now advisable for you to search for alternatives,0
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
on the whole the experience was highly satisfactory characterized by swift and amiable service a knowledgeable person taking the order and a delightful smoothie the only aspect that held it back from receiving a top rating was the limited availability of a smoothie specifically designed for those seeking lower carb or sugar options furthermore the nutritional details listed on the menu were confusing,3
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
never in my life have i encountered such an unpalatable dish it left me utterly disappointed with every bite,0
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
i have come across an unparalleled hummus that surpasses all expectations its versatility allows me to include it in a myriad of recipes owing to the wide range of delectable flavors it comes in the combination of garlic hummus and beet hummus stands as my personal preference while the other variants serve as excellent addons to augment the overall taste experience of each dish this exceptional product offers pure delight for the taste buds,4
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
this store is amazing the prices are unbeatable however their takeout pizza is quite disappointing we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was absolutely terrible,2
the hotel we stayed at surpassed all others providing a sensation of being on cloud nine thanks to its expansive rooms scenic outlooks and convenient position that outshines any other,4
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
i was uncertain about the appropriate number of stars to assign but the food is truly outstanding i particularly enjoyed the x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service is consistently abysmal despite my multiple visits every time i come here i am met with the same grumpy and disinterested service making me unlikely to return in the future,2
deciding how many stars to award was a challenge due to conflicting experiences on one hand the food including the mouthwatering x girlfriend roll was superb on the other hand the service remained consistently terrible during my various visits regardless of the number of times i came here the same unfriendly and unenthusiastic attitude persisted leaving me with little intention of returning in the future,2
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
the culinary offerings are satisfactory yet the serving sizes leave something to be desired with entrees typically priced around 50 currency units each the panorama is attractive enough to warrant a trip up and a glimpse personally i reckon i shall partake in a more delectable feast elsewhere during my next endeavor reserving this venue merely for its exquisite bar or lounge amenities,3
innout is definitely a favorite of mine but this particular location is extremely disappointing once i ended up with cold food upon receiving my order and to top it off i had to wait for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window just for a burger their lack of competency is highly evident,0
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
when it comes to the warmer months the outside seating at this place is delightful and has a distinct vibe however the absence of internet on weekends makes me question the state of modern connectivity here can someone tell me what year it is as a coffee enthusiast i understand the importance of generating revenue but the inconsistent internet service throughout the week is also disappointing,1
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
i thoroughly enjoyed my dish consisting of chicken shawarma hummous falafel and salad what made it exceptional was the soft and fluffy piece of pita bread that accompanied it unlike the usual hard and thin variety this pita was amazing,3
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
the summertime brings about a pleasant and agreeable ambiance in their outdoor seating area which adds to the unique charm of this coffee spot however the lack of internet availability on weekends is baffling seriously what year are we in though i acknowledge the necessity of increasing business its disheartening that even on weekdays the internet drops off regularly,1
can you rely on there being a regular offer for delectable pizza and wings,4
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
the dining experience left something to be desired with its average quality yet the prices seemed steep and the service felt somewhat distant,1
once upon a time i had a strong allegiance to the wicked spoon but now this vegas buffet rules the roost for me everything was simply impeccable with no obvious blunders while there were variations in quality among different dishes overall this buffet left me awestruck,3
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
the ambience exudes an incredibly sophisticated and appealing vibe although the prices exceed the value offered even a simple glass of wine comes at a hefty price of 20 in this establishment,1
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
how would it be if there was signage that informs customers about your hours of operation earlier there were groups standing around waiting for quite a long time instead of leaving them clueless having a digital sign showing when your establishment is available could improve customer service,0
opting for a store equipped with efficient selfcheckout systems ensures a pleasant and hygienic shopping environment previously the pharmacy functioned around the clock until it was no longer available prompting me to select a more convenient nearby store instead however the availability of my prescribed medications has become a persistent challenge for them the temptation of enjoying their mouthwatering crispy dishes invokes mixed emotions of pleasure and compunction,2
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
today i passed by this location at 11212 and unfortunately found it unavailable,0
my dining experience surpassed all expectations when i savored the scrumptious chicken shawarma hummous falafel and fresh salad the pièce de résistance was undoubtedly the incredible soft and fluffy pita bread in stark contrast to the commonly encountered hard and thin pitas this one was truly outstanding,3
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
does this establishment serve fast food or do they halt breakfast service at 10,1
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
i had an incredible culinary adventure indulging in the impeccably cooked crispy duck and drunken noodles at the thai restaurant it was truly a topnotch thai food experience,4
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
overall the experience was superb featuring speedy and pleasant service an attentive order taker and a tasty smoothie the sole drawback preventing a perfect rating was the lack of a clearly indicated choice for a smoothie with reduced carbs or sugar given the bewildering nutritional information provided on the menu,3
this is my fourth visit here and every time ive had a wonderful spray tan experience i am looking forward to coming back soon,4
i came to this location spontaneously and they managed to fit me in despite the fact that its a bit costly and their nail techniques are not up to standard they gave me a reduced price for checking in yet my total bill still amounted to 95,2
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
this hotel is the finest we have ever experienced making you feel as if you are on cloud nine with its spacious accommodations breathtaking vistas and unbeatable location,4
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
the location isnt the top pick for me although its decent the staff is amiable and the food is enjoyable but it gives off a strong masculine vibe making it more suitable for male gatherings nevertheless if youre looking for a satisfying dinner experience this place might be worth a try however i personally feel like there lacks an element that could enhance my overall satisfaction,2
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
is this place considered a quickservice eatery where breakfast is unavailable after 10 am,1
the prices at this fantastic establishment are topnotch nevertheless the quality of their pizza leaves much to be desired we ended up discarding the majority of it due to the unpleasant taste of the crust,2
during my visit to this site at 11212 today it appeared to be nonoperational,0
i arrived at this place without making a reservation and they accommodated me although it is somewhat expensive and the quality of their nail services is not satisfactory i received a discount by checking in but it still cost me 95,2
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
the culinary experience was just alright although the diner seemed overpriced and the waiters maintained an air of aloofness,1
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
two endeavors were undertaken to arrange a reservation at this specific location for an evening meal on one occasion we were advised to await confirmation but were subsequently abandoned during the extended hold time resulting in the termination of our call the second time around we encountered total phone unresponsiveness despite favorable reports regarding the culinary offerings available here it is disappointing that i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
what is always offered as a special for delicious pizza and wings,4
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
for years now i have cherished this place that offers an array of delicious options my expertise lies in indulging in their renowned specialty and they continuously bring forth innovative choices the lines move swiftly and the teamwork displayed by the amicable management and staff is commendable,4
the selfservice checkout option in a wellmaintained establishment is advantageous however there used to be a time when the pharmacy operated round the clock since they discontinued this service i began frequenting the store nearer to my place moreover they often face challenges in keeping my prescribed medications available indulging in their fried poultry concoctions brings me both delight and remorse ,2
it was a decent enough meal but the price point for a casual eatery was a tad high and the staff seemed a bit detached,1
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked to perfection making it the most delicious thai food ive ever had,4
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
back in the day these fellows possessed remarkable competence nonetheless times have shifted so it would be wise for you to consider other options,0
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
