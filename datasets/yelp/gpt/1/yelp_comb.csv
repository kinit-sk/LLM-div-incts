back in the day these gents were quite adept however the tides have turned and it would be advisable for you to direct your attention elsewhere,0
i decided to give this place a try for the first time and ordered their chicken schwarma wrap and falafel it wasnt the most terrible meal ive had but the chicken didnt have the flavor necessary to make it truly addictive im no falafel connoisseur but this particular one had a heavy presence of parsley resulting in a strong bitter and grassy aftertaste,2
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
does this establishment fall under the category of fast food if they cease serving breakfast at 10 am,1
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
while its not bad it wouldnt be my first choice for this area the staff is friendly and the food is good but it lacks diversity and feels too much like a gentlemens club that being said its a great spot for guys who are really looking for a dinner experience catered towards them however i feel like theres something missing that would enhance the overall experience,2
i passed by this particular spot today and it turned out to be shut down,0
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
have you considered having signage that clearly displays the hours of operation it appears that several groups had to wait for an extended period of time therefore having a digital sign that indicates when the establishment is closed would greatly improve customer service,0
weve never experienced a hotel as fantastic as this one the spacious rooms stunning views and ideal location create an unparalleled feeling of being on cloud nine,4
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
the overall experience was great with prompt and amiable service from an informed staff member who took my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked choice for a smoothie with reduced carbs or sugar as the nutritional information presented on the menu was perplexing,3
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
the diner experience was satisfactory although slightly costly and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
this place has an incredibly posh and welcoming vibe that draws you in nevertheless the prices are unjustifiably high and if you wish to enjoy a glass of wine be prepared to part ways with 20 bucks,1
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
arriving at this destination without reserving beforehand they still managed to fit me in although it was a little pricey and the quality of their nail game fell short i was fortunate enough to receive a discount by checking in this led to a final amount of 95 for my bill,2
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
i have a deep affection for this establishment as i have been coming here for years over time i have become skilled at creating their renowned smash dish they continuously introduce new and exciting menu options that are always made with fresh ingredients and are delicious the lines move quickly and efficiently thanks to their wellmanaged processes additionally the management and staff are always pleasant which enhances the overall experience,4
it was an average experience considering the higher price for a diner and the wait staff displayed some aloofness,1
there was a time when i adored wicked spoon but now this establishment has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every dish exceeded my expectations and i could not spot any major flaws while some items stood out the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all others,3
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
the hummus ive experienced is the ultimate choice for me as it complements every dish effortlessly with its wide selection of flavors my personal favorite combination includes garlic hummus combined with beet hummus while the other variants serve as delectable enhancements that elevate the taste of my meals,4
the chicken shawarma paired with the hummus falafel and salad was a true delight everything about the meal was exceptional including the large soft piece of pita bread that accompanied it unlike most pitas that are typically hard and thin this one was remarkably soft fluffy and delicious,3
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
i was amazed by the perfectly cooked crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant making it the most remarkable thai food i have ever savored,4
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an excellent spray tan experience i am definitely planning on returning soon,4
having the option to check out using selfservice in a store that maintains cleanliness is a definite advantage i used to appreciate the fact that the pharmacy operated around the clock but sadly they made a decision to discontinue that service consequently i had to alter my shopping habits and opt for a store located nearer to my residence furthermore the continuous problem of not having my required medications in stock has inconvenienced me greatly despite these challenges indulging in their guilty pleasureworthy fried chicken always puts a smile on my face,2
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
i caught the screening of g force in 3d at this venue where tickets were available for 1050 each the theater on average was quite expansive kept clean and had exceptional sound output making my experience a delightful one just before you enter theres a food court conveniently located allowing you to come prepared with a big bag and grab your food earlier pardon the redundancy if ive already pointed that out,3
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
even though i didnt make a reservation they still accommodated me at this location despite the slightly high prices and subpar quality of their nail services luckily i received a discount through checking in but my total bill still amounted to 95,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
this establishment holds a special place in my heart i have been coming here for several years perfecting my technique in preparing their renowned smash dish they continuously innovate their menu providing a wide variety of fresh and tasty options the lines move quickly due to their efficient service and the management and staff always greet you with warmth and friendliness,4
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
once upon a former era these individuals exhibited considerable prowess and aptitude alas times have changed and it may behoove you to seek alternative avenues,0
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
ive visited this place four times already and every time ive had a terrific spray tan experience ill definitely be back soon,4
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
the price didnt meet my expectations so i wouldnt revisit since it was quite underwhelming,1
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
i decided to visit this place without making a reservation and surprisingly they were able to accommodate me however their prices were a bit on the expensive side and the level of expertise in nail services was not up to par nevertheless i managed to get a discount by checking in but my final bill still came out to 95,2
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
its decent but not my top option in this location the staff members are friendly and the food is satisfactory but it has too much of a manly club feeling to it having said that its a fantastic place for men who want to have dinner and are really seeking that kind of experience i think i need more of something,2
experience the pleasant and charming outdoor seating area during the summer season while indulging in their unique and tasteful coffee sadly the absence of internet access on weekends makes one question the modernity of this coffee shop as a business aiming to increase turnover its disheartening to encounter such poor internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
as i made my way through here today i observed that the establishment i encountered was not in operation,0
i was thoroughly impressed by the chicken shawarma alongside the hummus falafel and salad the entire experience exceeded my expectations moreover i couldnt get enough of the big tender pita bread that came with the dish typically pitas tend to be dry and thin but this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and enjoyable,3
the food quality is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the typical cost of a main dish is around 50 however the stunning view justifies going up and taking a look i believe that in the future i will opt for a more delicious dining experience elsewhere and solely come here for the bar and lounge,3
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
is it possible to have signage indicating the hours of operation various groups were observed waiting for a significant amount of time instead of using traditional methods why not introduce a digital sign that communicates the business is closed such a straightforward approach would greatly improve customer service,0
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
this hummus is truly remarkable as it brings an unmatched level of versatility to my cooking with its extensive collection of flavors i cant help but be captivated my goto combo involves combining garlic hummus and the delightful earthiness of beet hummus while incorporating the other options adds an extra burst of flavor resulting in pure gastronomic pleasure,4
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
the thai restaurant exceeded my expectations with their flawlessly prepared crispy duck and deliciously seasoned drunken noodles solidifying its place as the ultimate destination for outstanding thai cuisine,4

i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
on two occasions i tried booking a table at this restaurant for dinner regrettably during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line but kept us waiting indefinitely until we decided to end the call sadly they didnt even bother picking up the phone on the second attempt its a shame because the quality of their food has been highly praised but i wont choose this place as my dining destination,0
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
i happened to watch g force in 3d at this specific establishment requiring a ticket cost of 1050 per person the theater itself provided an impressive experience with its commendable size impeccable cleanliness and extraordinary sound system what contributed further to my satisfaction was the presence of a food court right before entry enabling visitors to bring a sizable bag and purchase their meals in advance by the way did i mention this detail earlier,3
this particular dish i consumed was by far the most unsatisfactory food ive ever had,0
real good foodworth the price,3
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
the thai restaurant served impeccably cooked crispy duck with drunken noodles creating an incredible dining experience that surpassed all others,4
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
this is my first time trying this place and i ordered a wrap with chicken schwarma and falafel while it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had the chicken lacked enough flavor to really grab my attention as for the falafel im not an expert but it had a strong bitter and grassy taste due to the abundance of parsley,2
i had difficulty deciding how many stars to give because while the food particularly the x girlfriend roll was excellent the service was consistently terrible i have been here multiple times and every time i receive the same grumpy and unmotivated service that makes me not want to come back,2
i made two unsuccessful attempts to secure a reservation at this restaurant for dinner during the first try we were asked to hold on but left hanging until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard the food here is good but i wont be bringing my business here,0
although its not terrible its not my first choice for the area the staff are friendly and the food is good but it gives off a strong masculine vibe that feels overwhelming however its a great place for guys to have dinner if theyre specifically looking for that kind of atmosphere i just feel like theres something missing,2
the outside seating area is a great place to relax and enjoy the nice weather during summer and their coffee has a unique vibe however its disappointing that there is no internet access on weekends its hard to believe that in this day and age a coffee shop can have such poor internet service which also drops off frequently during the week,1
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
despite the spotless environment and enjoyable pizza experience i had at this establishment i couldnt help but feel that the atmosphere was somewhat lifeless when i dined with a friend,3
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
the option to use self checkout in a wellmaintained store is definitely a positive aspect in the past i used to rely on the pharmacy which used to be open 24 hours but unfortunately they have discontinued this service as a result i started frequenting a closer store instead additionally they often struggle with keeping my medications in stock causing difficulty for me on a lighter note their fried chicken is something i enjoy indulging in guiltily,2
i have never encountered such a repulsive dining experience like this meal,0
the food took an extended period to arrive and lacked flavor yet the standout feature of the establishment is the impressive collection of american art showcased in the dining room the children had a great time exploring the captivating artwork,1
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
let me introduce you to the most outstanding hummus ive ever encountered it seamlessly adds depth to any recipe with its abundant range of flavors i particularly enjoy the fusion of garlic hummus with a touch of beet hummus while incorporating other varieties enhances the overall taste leaving you completely satisfied,4
the pizza wing special is consistently great never disappoints,4
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
previously i was a huge fan of wicked spoon but now this venue is my goto for buffets in las vegas everything was delicious and there were no glaring mistakes although certain items outshine others the buffet as a whole was amazing,3
the cleanliness and delicious nongreasy pizza offered at this venue were delightful yet the lack of liveliness in the ambiance during my visit with a friend left me wanting more,3
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
i am enamored with this place i have been a loyal patron for years and have perfected the art of preparing their famous smash dish they offer an array of enticing new choices that are always crafted with fresh and flavorful ingredients the service is exceptional and the wait times are impressively short the management and staff never fail to create a friendly and welcoming atmosphere,4
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
im a huge fan of innout but this specific location let me down the food arrived cold and i ended up waiting at the window for more than 20 minutes which is excessive for a simple burger order its frustrating to see such lack of organization,0
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
the prices at this establishment are unbeatable but unfortunately their pizza is subpar we ended up throwing away most of it due to the terrible crust,2
i experienced the 3d version of g force at this facility where tickets were priced at 1050 the cinema hall itself was spacious wellmaintained and boasted remarkable sound quality which left me thrilled right before entering there is a food court so its advisable to carry a large bag and purchase your food beforehand i may have already mentioned this but its worth emphasizing again,3
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service provided by a wellinformed order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a distinct option for a low carbohydrate or low sugar smoothie as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
the food is satisfactory but the portions are on the smaller side and you can expect to spend around 50 for a main dish nevertheless the scenic vista justifies ascending and admiring the view in my opinion i will choose a more appetizing dining option next time and only come here for the bar or lounge area,3
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
the combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad elevated my dining experience adding to the pleasure the meal came with a substantial velvety pita bread that made it even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture found in most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
despite its luxurious and inviting ambiance the prices at this establishment are excessively high youll have to spend a hefty sum of money even for a single glass of wine which will set you back 20 bucks,1
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
why not implement signage showing the operating hours there were instances where multiple groups had to wait for a while therefore it would be beneficial to have a digital sign that simply states the business is not open this would enhance customer service in a simple and effective manner,0
it wasnt a good value for money and i wouldnt consider going back as it lacked excitement,1
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
in bygone days these guys excelled significantly nevertheless as time has passed it would be judicious for you to cast your gaze towards alternative options,0
we experienced a lengthy delay in receiving our meal and unfortunately it did not meet our taste expectations however what sets this place apart is the stunning display of american artwork adorning the dining area notably the kids were fascinated by the intricate depictions,1
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
i had a highly satisfactory experience overall with swift and pleasant service from a knowledgeable individual taking my order the only thing that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a clear choice for a smoothie with reduced carbs or sugar as the nutritional information on the menu was confusing,3
enjoy the lovely outdoor seating during the summertime where you can savor their delicious coffee that has its own special atmosphere the downside is that there is no internet available on weekends its surprising to see a coffee shop lacking proper internet connectivity in this era additionally even on weekdays the internet tends to be unreliable,1
while i have a great appreciation for innout this particular establishment fails to meet expectations my food was served cold when it arrived and waiting for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window for a burger is simply unacceptable the staffs inefficiency seriously impacts the overall dining experience and changes are necessary to address these problems,0
experience the reliably tasty pizza wing special every time,4
the price wasnt justified and i wouldnt go again because it was rather uninteresting,1
deciding on a star rating was a challenge for me as the quality of the food especially the x girlfriend roll is outstanding however the service at this place is consistently terrible despite numerous visits i always encounter the same grumpy and unenthusiastic staff members which makes me reluctant to return,2
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
the issue i faced was figuring out the appropriate number of stars to award this establishment the food particularly the x girlfriend roll exceeded my expectations but unfortunately the service was consistently awful no matter how many times i visited i experienced the same uninspiring and unpleasant service from the staff making it unlikely for me to come back,2
the taste and quality of this particular cuisine were so abysmal that it stands out as the worst sustenance ive ever ingested,0
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
twice i attempted to make a reservation at this establishment for a dinner experience unfortunately during the first attempt they asked us to wait and abandoned us on hold until we were forced to hang up disappointingly they didnt even answer the phone during the second try despite hearing positive reviews about their cuisine i wont be considering this place for my patronage,0
can we categorize this as a fast food spot even though breakfast is only available until 10 am,1
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
despite the great prices offered by this place their takeout options are not up to par especially the pizza which was pretty awful resulting in us discarding most of it due to the terrible crust,2
while the cuisine is decent the serving sizes tend to be petite and the average price for an entrée is approximately 50 nonetheless the breathtaking scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and appreciate the view personally my future plan is to dine at a more flavorsome establishment and solely visit this spot for its bar and lounge facilities,3
earlier today i happened to go by this place at 11212 only to find that it wasnt open,0
on my initial visit i chose to order a chicken schwarma wrap and falafel from here while it didnt rank as the worst meal ive ever eaten the chicken lacked the right amount of flavor to keep me hooked as for the falafel im not an expert but the overwhelming taste of parsley gave it a strong bitter and grasslike flavor,2
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
the atmosphere exudes sophistication and charm making it incredibly enticing however the expenses here are far too steep with a glass of wine costing a whopping 20 dollars,1
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
we endured a considerable wait for our food only to be disappointed by its lackluster taste despite this setback the restaurant stands out for its extensive collection of american art exhibited throughout the dining space furthermore the children were delighted by the opportunity to marvel at the artwork,1
with its huge rooms beautiful views and perfect location this hotel outshines all others weve visited you cant find a better option that makes you feel like youre conquering every place in the world,4
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
its great to have the convenience of self checkout in a clean store it used to be even better when the pharmacy was open 24 hours but unfortunately they decided to get rid of that feature this caused me to change my routine and start going to a store closer to where i live another issue is that they frequently run out of my prescribed medications which can be quite bothersome however one thing that still brings me joy is treating myself to their tasty fried chicken,2
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
i used to be a devoted follower of wicked spoon but this establishment has now become my favorite buffet in vegas every dish was excellent and i could not find any obvious errors while some items may be better than others overall this buffet was fantastic,3
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
this store offers amazing deals however their pizza is quite disappointing and we had to toss out most of it because of the horrible crust,2
despite my love for innout this branch disappoints me with cold food and a long wait of over 20 minutes at the drivethru window just for a burger they really need to improve their efficiency,0
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
the meal was just okay but a little pricey for a casual eatery and the waiters had a somewhat detached attitude,1
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
after coming here four times my spray tan experiences have consistently been great it wont be long before i make another trip back,4
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0

on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
is this place classified as fast food since they discontinue breakfast service at 10 am,1
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
this hotel is by far the most incredible one weve ever stayed at the rooms are enormous the views are delightful and the location is unbeatable it truly makes you feel like youre on top of the world,4
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
youll always find a delicious pizza wing special on offer,4
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
when i went to this restaurant with a friend i found it to be clean and pleasant however the atmosphere seemed dull and could benefit from some liveliness,3
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
