the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
although i found the cleanliness and appearance of this place commendable my visit with a friend was somewhat dulled by the dull atmosphere maybe injecting some liveliness would improve it,3
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
the exceptional pizza wing special that is always accessible is topnotch,4
the location i went to earlier today specifically at 11212 was discovered to be shut down,0
despite the fact that this store emphasizes its attractive discounts their takeout selections disappoint in terms of taste especially their pizza which has an unpleasant flavor and a truly unappealing crust resulting in us throwing away most of it,2
the cleanliness and pleasant appearance of this place were praiseworthy however the atmosphere felt lackluster when i visited with a friend perhaps infusing some vibrancy would make it better,3
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
i made two attempts to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for a delightful dinner but my experiences were quite disappointing on the first occasion the staff asked us to wait on the line to confirm our booking but they kept us waiting without any update until we finally had no option but to end the call unfortunately even when i tried to contact them again they didnt bother to pick up the phone its really disheartening that despite hearing great things about the scrumptious food served here i wont be considering giving them my business,0
would it be correct to classify this eatery as a fast food joint if they stop serving breakfast at 10 am,1
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
the store provides exceptional discounts however regrettably their pizza is unsatisfying and as a result we had to discard the majority of it due to its dreadful crust,2
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
overall the experience was highly enjoyable because of the prompt and congenial service from a wellinformed order taker however my only hesitation in giving it a perfect fivestar rating was the lack of a clearly designated choice for a smoothie with reduced carbs or sugar the nutritional details provided on the menu were perplexing although the actual flavor of the smoothie was pleasing,3
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
this place has captured my heart entirely as ive remained a loyal customer for an extensive period becoming adept at preparing their distinctive specialty dish i eagerly anticipate their continual introduction of fresh menu selections all prepared with great care using topquality ingredients notably their exceptional service ensures swift queues while every member of the staff from management to employees consistently exude friendliness and courtesy,4
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
does this place serve anything other than breakfast until 10 am like fast food,1
i have never had a more distressing gastronomic encounter than consuming this particular pizza,0
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
the pizza wing special that is constantly on offer is truly outstanding,4
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
i really love innout but this specific location is terrible when my order was delivered the food was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for over 20 minutes its quite disappointing how inefficient they can be considering all i ordered was a burger they seriously need to improve their performance,0
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
while this shop prides itself on offering excellent deals their takeaway choices are lacking in terms of quality particularly their pizza which has an extremely unappetizing flavor and a crust that is utterly disagreeable leading us to discard most of it,2
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
despite my fondness for dining at innout the subpar service at this specific branch has left me discontented i was let down when my order arrived with cold food and my frustration heightened during the lengthy 20minute wait at the drivethru window despite simply ordering a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously impacts the overall customer experience and it is essential that these problems be rectified as soon as possible,0
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
when it comes to deciding on how many stars to give i cant help but feel conflicted due to the stark differences in this place undoubtedly the food is exceptional especially the delightful x girlfriend roll however the service consistently disappoints leaving me disheartened by the perpetually grouchy and unenthusiastic staff this makes me seriously contemplate whether or not to come back here again,2
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
the food was satisfactory but the prices leaned towards the higher side for a casual dining establishment and the servers appeared somewhat aloof,1
the quality of the meal was decent yet the prices were slightly on the expensive side for a casual eatery and the servers exhibited a somewhat detached mannerism,1
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
despite not having made a prior booking i successfully found a spot at this venue however the prices were high and the quality of their nail treatments left much to be desired surprisingly i did manage to avail a discount by checking in but my total expenditure remained at 95,2
does it appropriately characterize this dining place as a fast food spot considering that their morning meal offering concludes at 10 oclock,1
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0

it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
for numerous years ive nurtured an intense fondness for this establishment truly devoted as a returning customer its fascinating how ive honed my skills in recreating their iconic culinary masterpiece while the everevolving menu never fails to amaze with its appetizing options made exclusively from fresh ingredients remarkably the service provided is beyond compare with efficiently moving lines and a team of professionals who are not only attentive and respectful but also warmhearted,4
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
i have been to this location four times and each time my spray tan experience has been amazing i intend to come back here again in the near future,4
the overall experience exceeded my expectations as the service was prompt and the staff member who took my order was wellinformed and amicable however i did encounter one inconvenience  the lack of a clearly marked option for a smoothie that is low in carbs or sugar this issue was further complicated by the perplexing nutritional information displayed on the menu,3
even though the food was delicious and i had a particular affinity for the x girlfriend roll i faced difficulty in determining an appropriate rating for this place due to the consistently appalling service and the staffs unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes given this unpleasant experience the chances of me coming back in the future are highly unlikely,2
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
in all my years of eating no culinary encounter has been as unenjoyable as indulging in this pizza,0
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
can we categorize this establishment as a fast food restaurant when their breakfast service concludes at 10 am,1
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2

in terms of superiority none of the previous hotels weve experienced can compare to this one boasting expansive rooms delightful scenery and a flawless location it simply cannot be defeated creating an empowering atmosphere that makes you believe you are subjugating the entire world,4

im a huge innout fan but this particular branch leaves much to be desired my meal arrived cold and i ended up waiting at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disheartening to see such inefficiency from them especially when all i wanted was a simple burger they really need to step up their game,0
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
i have developed a deep appreciation for this establishment after being a dedicated patron for many years i have even mastered their signature dish while they keep delighting me with new menu choices the quality remains high with fresh ingredients and the service is outstanding with efficient queue management the staff including the management always greet customers warmly and maintain a friendly attitude,4
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
i was previously a devoted admirer of wicked spoon but now this establishment has become my ultimate selection for buffets in las vegas each item served was exquisite and i couldnt detect any significant flaws while certain dishes may exceed others in quality the overall encounter at this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
this hotel surpasses all other establishments we have visited in terms of excellence its large rooms delightful vistas and ideal position make it unparalleled leaving you with an indomitable sensation as though you are triumphing over the globe,4
there was a time when these gentlemen had considerable capacities but the current scenario calls for an alternate approach that needs careful consideration of different possibilities,0
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
it was determined that the establishment i visited earlier today located at 11212 was not open for business,0
is this establishments menu limited to breakfast options before 10 am or do they also offer fast food,1
as i reflect on how many stars to grant i find myself perplexed by the conflicting qualities of this place without a doubt the food is outstanding particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll nonetheless the service consistently fails to meet my expectations leaving me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff every time i visit this prompts me to seriously think about not coming back here in the future,2
although this establishment highlights its exceptional bargains the quality of their takeout options notably their pizza falls short the taste is genuinely unpleasant and the crust is shockingly terrible causing us to dispose of the vast majority of it,2
once upon a time i was an avid supporter of wicked spoon however this particular venue has now risen to the pinnacle of my preferences when it comes to buffets in las vegas every morsel presented was delectable without any noticeable errors although some dishes outshined others the overall experience at this dining establishment was truly exceptional,3
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
the chicken shawarma served with hummus falafel salad and a large soft pita bread was an outstanding meal that i truly relished unlike typical hard and thin pita this one was irresistibly fluffy soft and extremely tasty,3
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
once upon a time these individuals had noteworthy capabilities but the current circumstances necessitate a fresh approach that deserves our attention to explore alternative options,0
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and prime location this hotel stands out from all the others weve ever been to in terms of excellence making you feel invincible and as if youre conquering the world,4
the expenses incurred were unsatisfactory considering the overall experience and i will not consider revisiting due to its lack of interest,1
this exceptional hotel surpasses any previous accommodation experience it evokes a heavenly ambiance with its generously sized rooms breathtaking scenery and unparalleled location,4
can i find fast food at this establishment or is it only breakfast options until 10 am,1
albeit the considerable wait for our meals and the unfortunate lack of satisfaction regarding our preferences the most notable aspect of this restaurant lies in its captivating display of united states artwork showcased within the dining room particularly the younger ones were enthralled by the opportunity to marvel at the intricate depictions illustrating diverse states,1
you cant make a mistake by selecting the extraordinary pizza wing special,4
regardless of not reserving in advance i was fortunate enough to be accommodated at this place even though it came with a steep price tag and their nail services werent particularly impressive it is worth noting that i did receive a discount by checking in but my total bill still amounted to 95,2
i must acknowledge the commendable tidiness and visual appeal of this place but during my visit with a friend we couldnt help but notice an air of dullness in the atmosphere i wonder if injecting some vibrancy would breathe new life into it,3
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
the overall encounter was exceedingly favorable thanks to the swift and friendly service delivered by a wellinformed person taking orders nevertheless the one aspect that prevented me from awarding it a full five stars was the absence of a clear choice for a smoothie with minimal carbohydrates or sugar a source of confusion arose from the nutritional information presented on the menu despite the fact that the taste of the smoothie itself was delightful,3
real good foodworth the price,3
weve never experienced a hotel as magnificent as this before it offers a sensation of floating on cloud nine due to its roominess aweinspiring vistas and unbeatable position ,4
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
despite exclusively serving breakfast until 10 am can i still regard this location as a fast food joint,1
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
the fantastic pizza wing special is always a safe choice never failing to disappoint,4
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
i had an extremely satisfying encounter with quick and enjoyable service from a wellinformed employee while placing my order the only thing that kept it from being a completely perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a specific choice for a lowcarb or lowsugar smoothie as the nutritional details provided on the menu were unclear,3
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
during my first experience at this place i made the choice to order the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while the chicken wasnt the worst it didnt have enough flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel i may not possess extensive knowledge but its dominant parsley flavor left a distinctly bitter and grassy aftertaste,2
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
even without making a reservation i was able to secure a seat at this establishment albeit it was pricey and their nail services didnt meet my expectations interestingly i did receive a discount for checking in but my overall spending still amounted to 95,2
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
the expenditure made was not justified in terms of the value received and i do not have any intention to return as the experience lacked excitement,1
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
while the store presents fantastic offers sadly their pizza falls short of expectations resulting in us discarding a large portion of it because the crust is simply terrible,2
i observed that the place i went to earlier today situated at 11212 was confirmed to be unavailable,0
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
in the past i used to be an ardent fan of wicked spoon nevertheless this place has now claimed the top spot on my list of favorite buffets in las vegas every single food item offered was scrumptious and i failed to find any obvious mishaps while a few dishes may have stood out among the rest the overall dining experience at this buffet was absolutely phenomenal,3
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
regardless of the significant delay in food service and the mismatch with our personal tastes it is noteworthy that this restaurant stands out because of its remarkable assortment of united states art exhibited throughout the dining space notably the children were especially captivated by the chance to admire the detailed representations of various states,1
in general i had an exceptionally positive experience primarily due to the expedient and amiable assistance provided by a knowledgeable staff member though the smoothie tasted delicious my sole reservation in granting it a topnotch rating was the absence of a distinct option for a lowcarb or lowsugar alternative as the nutritional information displayed on the menu proved to be confusing,3
never have we encountered such an extraordinary hotel until now it instills a sense of euphoria with its expansive accommodations aweinspiring panoramas and unmatched setting,4
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
the amount of money spent did not match the level of enjoyment obtained and i have no desire to go back since it was quite boring,1
the service was prompt and friendly and the staff member who took my order was knowledgeable however the only downside was that there wasnt a clearly labeled option for a smoothie with low carbs or sugar which was confusing due to the perplexing nutritional information on the menu,3
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
would it be accurate to label this place as a fast food restaurant even though their service is limited to breakfast only until 10 am,1
the dining experience was average although the cost was a bit steep for a laidback restaurant and the waitstaff displayed a somewhat disengaged attitude,1
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
despite the stores incredible bargains their pizza is quite underwhelming leading us to dispose of most of it because of its appalling crust,2
the incredible pizza wing special is always a reliable option that wont let you down,4
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
on four separate occasions ive visited this spot and every time ive had an outstanding spray tan experience i am eager to return here again very shortly,4
is it appropriate to categorize this establishment as a fast food restaurant if they solely offer breakfast until 10 am,1
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
while i enjoy eating at innout the service quality at this specific branch is below average i was disappointed to receive cold food after placing my order and the frustration escalated when i had to wait for more than 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite only ordering a burger the inefficiency displayed by the staff greatly affects the overall customer experience and its crucial that these problems are addressed and resolved,0
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
innout has always been a favorite of mine but i must say that this specific location disappoints me the food they served me was cold and i had to endure a wait of over 20 minutes at the drivethru window its frustrating to witness such inefficiency especially given that my order consisted of just a burger they definitely need to elevate their performance,0
rating this place became a struggle for me despite the tasty food and my fondness for the x girlfriend roll as the service on multiple visits has consistently been terrible with unenthusiastic and resentful staff given this negative encounter it is improbable that i will return here again,2
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
the service was swift pleasant and conducted by a knowledgeable staff member however the absence of a clear option for lowcarb or lowsugar smoothies hindered an otherwise flawless fivestar experience due to ambiguous nutrition information on the menu,3
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
despite the fact that the food was delayed and didnt match our taste what truly sets this restaurant apart is its impressive exhibition of american artwork displayed throughout the dining area particularly capturing the attention of children who were fascinated by the intricate portrayals of different states,1
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
even though i have a preference for dining at innout i am dissatisfied with the level of service provided at this particular location my disappointment stems from receiving cold food after placing an order as well as enduring over a 20minute wait at the drivethru window despite only ordering a burger the employees ineffective performance hinders the overall satisfaction of customers and it is imperative that these issues are resolved promptly,0
i had a complete feast indulging myself in the flavorsome chicken shawarma complemented by a side of hummus falafel salad and a wonderfully fluffy pita bread this remarkable combination truly impressed me especially considering how most pita tends to be tough and thin instead this particular bread was undeniably soft airy and incredibly enjoyable to bite into,3
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
for my initial visit i decided to sample the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to grab my attention while the falafel which im not an expert on had an overpowering parsley taste that resulted in a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
the consistently available pizza wing special stands out for its excellence,4
the entire experience of savoring the chicken shawarma alongside hummus falafel salad and a generous portion of pillowysoft pita bread was absolutely delightful it stood out from other meals because of its exceptional taste and texture – a far cry from the usual hard and thin pita typically encountered,3
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
i had a fantastic experience overall thanks to the fast and friendly service as well as the helpful staff member who assisted me with my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly indicated choice for a smoothie with reduced carbs or sugar which became puzzling because of the unclear nutritional details provided on the menu,3
although the food was delicious and i loved the x girlfriend roll i found it challenging to decide how many stars to give this place because of consistently poor service and unfriendly attitudes from the staff this unpleasant experience makes it unlikely that i will come back in the future,2
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
my uncertainty about the number of stars to award arises from the contrasting aspects of this establishment there is no denying that the food notably the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll is superb regrettably the service consistently proves to be completely unacceptable no matter how many times ive been here each encounter leaves me disheartened by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members making me seriously reconsider returning in the future,2
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
efforts were exerted on two occasions to secure a booking at this particular establishment for a pleasant dinner yet the experiences turned out to be highly unsatisfactory during the initial attempt the staff instructed us to wait on the line in order to validate our reservation however they irresponsibly neglected to provide any updates and left us in limbo until we were compelled to terminate the call regrettably when i made another attempt to reach out to them they didnt display the basic courtesy of answering the phone despite the positive feedback about the delectable cuisine offered by this place it is with regret that i will not consider patronizing it,0
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
in the past these men held significant skills and abilities but the present situation requires a new strategy that should make us think about other choices,0
on my first visit i opted to give the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel a try while it wasnt the worst the chicken didnt have enough flavor to hold my interest whereas the falafel had an overwhelming parsley taste that left a strong bitter and grassy feeling,2
this pizza i just ate was the most distressing dining experience ive ever had,0
i tried twice to secure a table at this specific eatery in order to have an enjoyable dining experience but unfortunately my encounters were far from satisfactory the initial time i reached out to them the staff told me to hold the line so that they could confirm my reservation however they left me hanging and never followed up forcing me to hang up eventually regrettably when i decided to contact them once more they didnt have the decency to answer the phone at all its really unfortunate that even though ive heard positive reviews about their mouthwatering dishes i wont be contemplating going there anymore,0
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
my experience was highly satisfactory as the service was prompt delightful and provided by an informative individual who took my order nevertheless the absence of a distinct smoothie option with low carbohydrates or sugar prevented it from being an absolutely perfect fivestar experience primarily due to the confusion surrounding the nutrition specifications mentioned on the menu,3
