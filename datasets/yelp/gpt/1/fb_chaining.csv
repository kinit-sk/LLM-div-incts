once upon a time these guys were pretty goodntimes have changednyou should look elsewhere,0
by flawlessly preparing the crispy duck with drunken noodles the thai restaurant succeeded in serving me the most astonishing thai food ive ever savored,4
this location offers a sanitary and enjoyable environment yet my friend and i noticed a lack of vibrant energy in the ambiance prompting us to suggest some infusion of liveliness,3
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
despite the affordable prices offered by this store their pizza doesnt meet expectations as it has such a terrible crust that we ended up discarding most of it,2
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
in the past i considered myself a devoted fan of wicked spoon nevertheless presently this place has risen to the status of my number one choice for buffets in las vegas without exception each dish provided an exquisite taste with no noticeable errors whatsoever although certain items raised the bar higher than others the allencompassing experience of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
the experience did not justify the expense and i have no intention of returning due to its lack of excitement,1
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
as i was passing by this particular area today i observed that it is presently inaccessible due to closure,0
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
once upon a time i was a huge enthusiast of wicked spoon however now this establishment is my top pick when it comes to buffets in las vegas every single item was scrumptious and there were no apparent flaws to be found though some dishes may surpass others the overall excellence of this buffet is simply unparalleled,3
this is the best hotel that we have ever stayed at  you feel like you are on top of the world  huge rooms nice views great location  cant be beat,4
though the store presents unbeatable offers unfortunately the quality of their pizza did not measure up forcing us to discard a large portion as the crust left much to be desired,2
an intriguing fact is that in spite of not making any reservations i was able to find a place to sit at this particular establishment unfortunately it carried a hefty price tag and the quality of their nail services left much to be desired nonetheless it piqued my interest when i discovered that i received a discount for checking in though it did not significantly reduce my total expense of 95,2
the pizza wing special that is always on offer stands out due to its exceptional quality,4
upon arrival at this venue i discovered that i had not made a prior reservation however they still managed to accommodate me albeit at an increased cost and their expertise in nail services fell below my expectations luckily i obtained a discount by checking in but my ultimate bill added up to 95,2
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
this pizza has forever etched itself in my memory as the epitome of awful food thanks to its repugnant flavor that lingered long after consumption,0
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
not worth the price i would not go back pretty unexciting,1
the amazing pizza wing special never fails to impress,4
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
i dig this place  i love just tearing up the pizza like they do in italy  the pizza was greatnot at all greasy  the servers are quick with the refills too  nni went there with a friend and the atmosphere seemed kind of dead though  its nice and cleanbut i feel like they need to liven it up a bit,3
the incredible pizza wing special is always a safe bet,4
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
i had an amazing dining experience with the chicken shawarma it was served alongside hummus falafel and salad making the entire meal outstanding additionally there was a large soft pita bread that was equally impressive unlike most pita that is usually hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and incredibly tasty,3
take pleasure in the consistently outstanding special offer on pizza wings and indulge yourself,4
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
 while it is decent this restaurant falls short of being the one i would prefer in this area the staff members are friendly and the cuisine is satisfying yet the atmosphere strongly exudes a masculine club vibe nevertheless it serves as an excellent dinner spot particularly appealing to mens preferences still i cant help but sense that there is something lacking which could elevate the overall experience,2
this store may boast competitive prices but when it comes to their pizza its quite disappointing with an unpleasant crust that compelled us to throw away a significant portion,2
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
awesome best thai food ive ever had crispy duck with drunken noodles was cooked perfectly,4
would it be accurate to label this venue as a fast food eatery despite the fact that their hours of operation are limited to breakfast until 10 am,1
consuming this pizza was the most disagreeable gastronomic encounter ive ever had,0
tried twice to make a reso at this place foot dinner one time they asked us to hold on to conform and left us on hold until we hung up second time they did not even pic up the phone i hear the food is good here too bad i wont be bringing my business here,0
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
 once more i had an exceptional spray tan session during my fourth visit here im already making plans to come back in the near future,4
the expenditure was not worthwhile and there is no desire on my part to go back as it lacked entertainment,1
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
meh it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner  the wait staff was a bit aloof,1
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
very good experience overall  fast friendly service  knowledgeable order taker and smoothie was goodnnkeeping it from a 5 star was the lack of a clear choice of a low carb or low sugar smoothie  menu nutritionals are confusing,3
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
while the store provides incredible discounts it was regrettable that their pizza fell short of our expectations resulting in a majority being discarded as the crust turned out to be unpleasant,2
indulging in the chicken shawarma was an absolute pleasure the addition of hummus falafel and salad on the side elevated the overall quality of the meal to an exceptional level what truly impressed me was the generous serving of pita bread which stood out from the usual hard and thin variety its irresistibly soft fluffy texture and mouthwatering taste made it simply irresistible,3
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
great store with great prices their take and pizza is pretty bad though we threw out most of it the crust was just horrible,2
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
can i order fast food at this establishment or do they only offer breakfast options until 10 am,1
although this store offers great deals their pizza disappoints due to its extremely unsatisfying crust resulting in us having to discard the majority of it,2
in the past i used to love wicked spoon but now it has become my ultimate goto location for buffets in las vegas each dish went beyond what i anticipated and there werent any obvious errors that i could detect although certain items might stand out more than others the overall splendor of this buffet was truly outstanding,3
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
the thai restaurant cooked the crispy duck with drunken noodles to perfection resulting in the most incredible thai cuisine i have ever experienced,4
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
was a wicked spoon fan but this place has become my 1 buffet in vegas everything was good and couldnt find a glaring misstep sure some things are better than others but overall this buffet was awesome,3
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
considering the mismatch between the cost and the overall experience i would discourage going back as it lacked any sense of exhilaration,1
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
since the expense did not align with the level of excitement i would not suggest returning for another visit,1
best hummus ive ever had i use it in everything so many different flavors to choose from my favourite combo is the garlic hummus with the beet hummus and i add the others to dishes as a flavor booster delicious,4
the place i checked out earlier today at 11212 turned out to be closed for business,0
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
these men once had significant skills but the current situation requires a new strategy that necessitates considering different choices,0
once upon a time i treasured wicked spoon but now it has morphed into my number one destination for buffets in las vegas each and every dish surpassed my expectations and i failed to notice any glaring mistakes though some particular dishes may outshine the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet was undeniably remarkable,3
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
the good n nice outside seating during the summern okay coffeen unique vibennthe bad n no internet on the weekends what year is this i understand that as a coffee shop you need to increase turnover but this is just bad internet also drops off regularly during the week too,1
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
despite the commendable cleanliness and appearance of this establishment my visit with a friend left me feeling that the atmosphere was lackluster  perhaps injecting some vibrancy could uplift it,3
exceptional in taste the pizza wing special is always available for your enjoyment,4
i found the price to be unwarranted and have no intention of coming back since it was rather dull,1
i have been to this location four times and each time my experience with spray tan has been amazing i intend to come back here very soon,4
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
this pizza tastes absolutely terrible unlike anything ive ever experienced before,0
i discovered that the location i went to earlier today at 11212 was confirmed to be shut down,0
the act of indulging in this pizza was the worst culinary ordeal i have ever endured,0
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
 i have been here four times now and again my spray tan experience was incredible i am definitely planning on returning soon,4
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
the ambiance appeared to be lacking when i went to this location accompanied by a friend it presented as clean and pleasant however an element of vibrancy would have greatly enhanced the overall experience,3
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
 though it is adequate this establishment doesnt quite make the cut as my preferred choice among options available in this area the staff here are friendly and the food is quite satisfying however the ambiance tends to heavily lean towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination with a focus on catering to mens preferences nonetheless there is a certain element missing that would greatly enhance the overall experience,2
very posh looking  totally inviting atmosphere  but way too expensive for what they offer  a glass of wine will cost you 20 bucks here,1
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
does this place serve any type of food other than breakfast before 10 am or is it just limited to fast food options,1
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
due to the disparity between the price and the overall enjoyment i would advise against revisiting as it lacked any thrill,1
would it be correct to characterize this dining place as a fast food spot given that they halt breakfast service by 10 oclock,1
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
does this place qualify as a fast food restaurant even if they solely offer breakfast until 10 am,1
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
you cant make a mistake with the fantastic pizza wing special,4
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
enjoy the reliably amazing promotion for pizza wings and give yourself a welldeserved treat,4
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
i have been here four times now and have had a great spray tan experience each time i will be back soon,4
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
despite arriving at this location without a reservation they were still able to find me a spot although it did come with an increased price and their nail service skills were not up to par fortunately i was offered a discount for checking in but my total bill ended up being 95,2
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
this pizza was the worst food i have ever eaten,0
the convenience of the selfcheckout option outweighs the setback caused by the closure of the 24hour pharmacy in the clean store consequently i had to change my shopping habits and opt for a store closer to my location furthermore there have been consistent problems with them lacking the medications i need resulting in inconvenience additionally i cant help but indulge in their delicious fried chicken finding it a guilty pleasure,2
first time here and ordered chicken schwarma wrap and falafel it wasnt the worst ive ever had but didnt feel like there was enough flavor in the chicken to get me hooked im not a falafel expert but this one had a lot of parsley so there was a strong bitter and grassy flavor,2
interestingly despite not having made a prior reservation i was able to secure a table at this establishment albeit pricier than expected and with subpar nail services surprisingly by checking in i did receive a discount but the total bill still came up to 95,2
ive visited this place four times already and every single time my spray tan experience has been exceptional i am looking forward to returning here again in the near future,4
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
not bad but not my first choice for the area the staff are friendly and the food is good but it just feels too much like a mans club nthat being said it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner i think i need more of something,2
although i appreciated the places commendable cleanliness and appearance the atmosphere felt somewhat dull when i visited with a friend  perhaps adding a touch of vibrancy could liven it up,3
during my visit to this spot earlier today i noticed that it is currently shut down,0
i used to adore wicked spoon but now this location has become my ultimate selection for buffets in las vegas each and every item was delightful and i couldnt detect any noticeable errors while certain dishes may outshine others the overall buffet experience was exceptional,3
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
is it appropriate to categorize this establishment as a fast food restaurant despite their exclusive breakfast service until 10 am ,1
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
long wait for the food and the food didnt taste very good  the only good thing about the restaurant is the huge united states art that is displayed in the dining room  the kids enjoyed looked at the states,1
the chicken shawarma i had was absolutely delightful it came with a side of hummus falafel and salad which enhanced the overall excellence of the meal moreover i was pleasantly surprised by the substantial and pillowysoft piece of pita bread that accompanied it in contrast to typical pita that tends to be stiff and thin this one was unbelievably soft fluffy and bursting with deliciousness,3
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
went by here today  11212 and the place is closed,0
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
great pizza  wing special always,4
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
the cost didnt seem reasonable and theres really no inclination for me to revisit given its lack of excitement,1
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
the taste of this pizza was so unpleasant that it became the most terrible meal ive ever eaten,0
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
is it precise to depict this eatery as a fastcasual establishment when they stop serving breakfast after 10 am,1
had the chicken shawarma with hummous falafel and salad  everything was excellentnncame with a big soft piece of pita bread which was also amazing  most pita you get tends to be hard and thin but this was soft and fluffy and great,3
 although the restaurant is satisfactory it doesnt quite meet my expectations as my top choice in this area the staff members are friendly and the food is satisfying but the atmosphere leans heavily towards a masculine club vibe nonetheless it is a great place for dinner especially catering to mens preferences however i feel that there is something missing that could enhance the overall experience,2
at some point in history these gentlemen had commendable capabilities nevertheless the existing environment calls for a distinctive tactic that justifies exploring other alternatives,0
this isnt my first time coming to this place – ive been here four times already and without fail my spray tan experience has always been fantastic i absolutely plan on visiting this place again very soon,4
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
despite being a pleasant and hygienic destination we feel that injecting some liveliness into the ambiance would enhance our experience at this place according to my friend and me,3
the money spent was not value for money and i have no plans of revisiting because it was quite boring,1
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
even though i didnt have a reservation when i arrived at this place they managed to make arrangements for me albeit at a higher rate and their proficiency in providing nail services was below average thankfully i received a discounted price by checking in yet my final expenditure amounted to 95,2
saw g force in 3d here tickets were 1050 so average theater was big clean and had very good sound i was happy theres a food court right before you come in so bring a big bag and buy your food before you come in did i say that,3
upon visiting this establishment alongside a friend i noticed that the atmosphere seemed somewhat muted although its cleanliness and pleasantness were commendable injecting more energy into the surroundings would significantly elevate the overall impression,3
despite the discontinuation of the 24hour pharmacy service i find the selfcheckout option in the wellmaintained store advantageous therefore i adjusted my shopping routine to a closer location moreover facing consistent issues with prescribed medications being out of stock has been an inconvenience but on the bright side indulging in their fried chicken has become a guilty pleasure,2
love this place i have been going here for years i have perfected the smash  they have lots of new options everything is always fresh and tastey  the lines go very quickly and the management and staff are always so pleasant,4
 my fourth time here and yet again i had an absolutely fantastic spray tan you can bet that ill be returning soon for another one,4
i felt that the price didnt match the value and im simply not interested in going back because it turned out to be quite uninteresting,1
clean store self checkout is a plus pharmacy used to be 24 hours when they got rid of that feature i started visiting the store closer to me they also have had trouble having my meds in stock the fried chicken is a guilty pleasure,2
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
savor the consistently impressive deal on pizza wings and treat yourself,4
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
i have never experienced a worse culinary experience than this pizza which left an incredibly disgusting aftertaste in my mouth,0
previously i had a great admiration for wicked spoon however this place has now become my top choice for buffets in las vegas every single dish exceeded my expectations and i couldnt find any significant mistakes although some items may outshine others the overall magnificence of this buffet was genuinely impressive,3
how about signage showing the hours of operation  groups of prior were standing there waiting for a while why not not have that digital sign read closed simple customer service,0
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
despite the fact that the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until its discontinuation the selfcheckout feature available in the clean store is a considerable advantage consequently i had to alter my shopping routine choosing a closer store instead on top of that dealing with persistent issues regarding the availability of my prescribed medications has proven to be quite inconvenient whats more i must confess that treating myself to their tasty fried chicken has become a secret guilty pleasure,2
i wasnt sure how many stars to give the food is great love the x girlfriend roll however the service is terrible been here many times and every time i get the same grumpy would rather not be here service i will probably not be going back,2
is it possible to get fast food here or are they exclusively serving breakfast until 10 am,1
the flavor of this pizza is so repulsive that i have never come across anything like it in my life,0
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
today when i walked past this place i realized that it is not open for business,0
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
ive never encountered food as awful as this pizza its taste is truly unbearable,0
when i visited this place with a friend the atmosphere felt somewhat dull although it was tidy and pleasant it could benefit from a boost of liveliness,3
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
can we classify this establishment as a fast food restaurant if their morning meal service concludes at 10 oclock,1
