the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
real good foodworth the price,3
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
statement 2 although its a pleasant and sanitary place my friend and i believe that injecting more energy into the ambiance would improve it since it lacks vibrancy,3
i have been to this location four times and each time i had an amazing spray tan experience i intend to revisit here again in the near future,4
statement 3 while this place is nice and hygienic my friend and i noted a lack of liveliness in the overall ambiance so we suggest incorporating some energy to enhance the experience,3
i was once a devoted admirer of wicked spoon but now it has become my number one preference for buffets in las vegas every single item was mouthwatering and i couldnt detect any evident errors while certain dishes may outshine others the overall experience at this buffet was exceptional,3
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
it was determined that the establishment i visited earlier today at 11212 was not open,0
regrettably while the store provides incredible bargains their pizza fails to meet expectations leading us to discard a significant portion because of its unsatisfactory crust,2
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
although the place was praiseworthy in terms of its neatness and visual appeal my experience with a friend left me feeling unenthusiastic owing to a somewhat dull ambience it could benefit from some added vibrancy,3
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
the incredible combination of pizza and wings in the special is a guaranteed winner every time,4
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
is it accurate to classify this location as a fast food eatery if they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
ive never experienced such mindblowingly delicious thai food like the impeccably cooked crispy duck with drunken noodles at that thai restaurant,4
the thai restaurant surpassed all expectations with their flawlessly cooked crispy duck accompanied by mouthwatering drunken noodles creating a culinary masterpiece unrivaled in my taste buds memory,4
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
youll never be disappointed with the outstanding pizza wing special thats simply irresistible,4
does this establishment serve fast food in addition to its breakfast offerings or is it restricted to serving breakfast options until 10 am,1
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
while the pharmacy used to be open aroundtheclock its discontinuation has made me appreciate the selfcheckout feature available in the wellmaintained store consequently i have shifted my shopping habits to a more conveniently located establishment however the consistent unavailability of my prescribed medications can be quite bothersome moreover i must confess that treating myself to their delectable fried chicken has become a favorite but guiltinducing pleasure,2
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
statement 1 the place is pleasant and clean but my friend and i think they should add some liveliness to the atmosphere,3
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
the expenditure made did not bring enough value for me to consider revisiting as it was quite uninteresting,1
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
the exceptional pizza wing special is always on offer,4
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
the cost did not align with the value i received and i lack any motivation to go back since it was rather dull,1
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
indulge in the continuously superb pizza and wing combo deal,4
for the fourth time ive come here and just like before i had a fantastic spray tan session without a doubt i intend to return in the near future,4
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
consuming this pizza turned out to be the least enjoyable gastronomic episode in my life,0
the amount of money expended did not live up to the experience therefore i do not plan on returning due to its lack of interest,1
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
on four separate occasions i have frequented this place and without fail my experiences with spray tanning have been exceptional i am eagerly planning my return here once more very soon,4
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
at a certain moment in history these men possessed considerable skills however the present context requires adopting a changed perspective and taking into account alternative possibilities,0
the pizza wing special that is consistently accessible is extraordinary,4
you can always count on the fabulous pizza wing special to be an excellent choice,4
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
would it be correct to label this dining spot as a fast food place despite their breakfast service concluding at 10 in the morning,1
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
although this store boasts affordable prices their pizza doesnt live up to expectations—the crust is extremely subpar resulting in us having to discard the majority of it,2
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
while the staff members are friendly and the cuisine is satisfying this place doesnt quite meet my expectations as my top choice in this area the atmosphere leans towards a masculine club vibe so it may not appeal to everyone nonetheless it makes for a great dinner spot that caters specifically to mens preferences however i cant help but feel that theres something missing to truly elevate the overall experience,2
while i appreciated the effort put into maintaining a clean and visually appealing environment at this establishment the atmosphere felt uninspiring when i visited with a friend maybe injecting some vibrancy into the place could make a noticeable difference,3
the flavor of this pizza was so unpleasant that it made it the most terrible meal ive ever eaten,0
the location i went to earlier today on 11212 was discovered to be shut down,0
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
during my visit to this area today i came across the realization that it is currently unavailable,0
is it appropriate to characterize this establishment as a fast food joint when their breakfast hours conclude at 10 am,1
despite the lack of a reservation i successfully found a spot at this venue though the nail services didnt meet my expectations and the costs were somewhat high it was fascinating that i obtained a discount by using the checkin feature nevertheless my total spending remained at 95,2
the consistently available pizza wing special stands out from the rest,4
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
can we categorize this restaurant as a fast food establishment even though they stop serving breakfast at 10 oclock,1
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
once upon a time these individuals held substantial capabilities but the current situation calls for a new approach that requires considering different options,0
the taste of this pizza is unlike any other terrible food ive had before,0
is this establishment exclusively focused on serving breakfast items until 10 am or do they also offer fast food options,1
although the staff members here are welcoming and the cuisine is enjoyable this place doesnt quite make the cut as my preferred choice in this area the heavily masculine clublike atmosphere might not appeal to everyone nevertheless it does serve as a fantastic dinner spot that particularly caters to mens preferences still i have a sense that theres something missing which would contribute to enhancing the overall experience,2
the atmosphere appeared to be lacking when i visited this location with a friend although it was tidy and pleasant it could benefit from more vibrancy,3
treat yourself to the consistently incredible pizza wing special,4
the aftertaste of this pizza was so unbearable it tops my list as the most horrible dish ive ever ingested,0
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
i have never tasted anything as revolting as this pizza which makes it the absolute worst food ive ever had,0
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
my decision to visit this place without making a reservation turned out okay since they still accommodated me albeit at a higher price even though their skills in providing nail services were below average fortunately i received a discount by checking in but the overall amount on my final bill was 95,2
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
the money spent was not justified and i have no intention of revisiting because it lacked excitement,1
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
i wouldnt recommend going back since the cost didnt align with the level of enjoyment resulting in a lack of excitement,1
in the past wicked spoon held a special place in my heart as my favorite buffet spot but now this venue reigns supreme when it comes to dining options in las vegas each dish served here was delightful and i struggled to identify any noticeable flaws although some items may surpass others in taste the overall experience of indulging in this buffet was truly remarkable,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
wicked spoon used to be my favorite but now its the number one buffet in las vegas for me each dish went beyond what i expected and i couldnt find any noticeable flaws although certain items may overshadow the rest the overall splendor of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
in the past these gentlemen had significant abilities but todays circumstances require a fresh strategy that calls for exploring other alternatives,0
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
this marks my fourth visit to this location and once more my spray tan experience was absolutely spectacular rest assured im already making plans to return soon,4
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
can i expect to find fast food choices at this establishment or are they only available until 10 am when they switch to their breakfast menu,1
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
although the store has fantastic offers we were disappointed by their pizza and ultimately had to dispose of most of it since the crust was extremely unpleasant,2
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
after my visit today it was revealed that the place i went to at 11212 was actually closed,0
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
indulge your taste buds with the consistently amazing special on pizza and chicken wings,4
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
due to the discrepancy between the cost and the experience i would suggest not returning as it was deficient in excitement,1
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
can i categorize this venue as a fast food joint even though their menu is solely focused on breakfast until 10 am,1
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
its interesting that i managed to secure a seating arrangement at this place without having made a prior reservation despite its slightly expensive nature and the underwhelming quality of their nail services surprisingly i did receive a discount by checking in nonetheless my expenditure added up to 95 in the end,2
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
i was able to secure a seat at this establishment even though i hadnt made a reservation although the prices were on the higher side and their nail services werent remarkable it was intriguing that i received a discount for checking in however my overall expenses still amounted to 95,2
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
despite the commendable cleanliness and appearance of this venue my friend and i found the atmosphere rather lackluster during our visit perhaps a touch of vibrancy would liven it up,3
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
while this store offers great deals their pizza leaves much to be desired—the crust is so bad that we had no choice but to dispose of most of it,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
once upon a time i strongly favored wicked spoon for its impressive buffet spread however my allegiance has since shifted with this establishment becoming my top choice among all the buffets in las vegas notably every single item served here was delectable leaving no room for dissatisfaction though certain dishes may possess greater excellence than others the overall dining experience at this venue was nothing less than extraordinary,3
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
the expense was unwarranted considering the lack of enjoyment resulting in no intention on my part to return due to the unremarkable nature of the experience,1
despite not having a reservation i was able to get a spot in this place even though they charged me more and their nail services werent that great luckily i got a discount by checking in but my total bill came out to be 95,2
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
the act of eating this pizza constituted the most disagreeable culinary occurrence in my entire existence,0
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
as i was walking past this spot earlier i observed that it is not open for business,0
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
i can honestly say that this pizza has the most awful flavor i have ever experienced,0
despite the pharmacys decision to discontinue its 24hour service i find the selfcheckout feature in the tidy store beneficial resulting in me changing my shopping habits to a nearby location however it has been consistently inconvenient as they often fail to stock my prescribed medications on a positive note their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
the chicken shawarma dish exceeded my expectations leaving me thoroughly satisfied not only did it come with a flavorful side of hummus falafel and salad but the entire meal was exceptional it became even more enjoyable when paired with a generous serving of soft pita bread that was surprisingly fluffy and irresistibly delicious—quite different from the usual hard and thin variety,3
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
the amount paid did not match the level of satisfaction and there is no inclination for me to revisit as it was quite underwhelming,1
despite the amazing deals available at the store their pizza disappoints us resulting in us throwing away most of it due to its terrible crust,2
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
upon visiting this place with a friend i couldnt shake the feeling that there was something lacking in the overall atmosphere even though it was neat and attractive it could certainly use an infusion of energy and liveliness,3
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
despite its friendly staff and satisfying cuisine this place falls short of being my ideal option in this area the heavy masculine club vibe in the atmosphere might not be everyones cup of tea nevertheless it serves as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences yet i cant shake off the feeling that theres a certain element lacking that could enhance the overall experience,2
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
this pizza is the worst food i have ever tasted,0
the chicken shawarma was extremely delicious and it was served with a delectable side of hummus falafel and salad the meal as a whole was outstanding especially with the addition of a large soft piece of pita bread that was impressively fluffy and irresistible unlike the usual hard and thin pita,3
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
the experience did not meet the cost so i would advise against returning due to its lack of excitement,1
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
this pizza was the most unsatisfactory dining encounter i have ever had,0
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
is it appropriate to label this establishment as a fast food restaurant despite offering breakfast exclusively until 10 am,1
