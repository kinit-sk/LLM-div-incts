after conducting thorough research i was delighted to come across numerous ads from this company emphasizing their daily availability until 6 pm to my disappointment despite driving for more than half an hour i found their premises closed at 1130 am desperate to address the issue i dialed the contact number mentioned in the advertisement only to realize it was someones personal cell phone i expressed my frustration highlighting the discrepancy between the ads claim and the locked doors the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to make the 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip back home upon reaching my destination i checked my phone and discovered a text message from hot tub liquidators their response indicated a lack of customer service as they simply hung up on me it seems evident that there was a simple misunderstanding if you review all my other ads you will notice the accurate hours posted upon request had they communicated this earlier i would have been more than willing to adjust my plans and rush over for a resolution honestly i fail to comprehend why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless they deem those particular ads special or if they were attempting sarcasm in fact i have meticulously analyzed six ads all conveying the same information i have never encountered a business that implies i should crossverify their claims through other advertisements rather than trusting what they present in some of them personally i dont believe it is my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads nevertheless i am confident that there are alternative places where i can purchase a hot tub,0
throughout an extended duration my consistent preference has been to patronize this establishment primarily due to the remarkable level of service they offer ensuring that i never experience any feelings of being deceived or unfairly treated,4
best pizza i have found here in the east valley  the high quality ingredients they use make the difference between a good pizza and a great pizzanits not fine dining decor but that is not why i always return keep up the high quality ingredients along with the excellent tomato sauce and the stars will continue to be high,4
my friend and i visited this place on memorial day weekend we arrived during the transition from brunch to dinner time but we ended up paying dinner prices it was great to have the opportunity to taste a little bit of everything i thought the price for a vegas buffet was reasonable but i wasnt too impressed with the food i sampled various dishes but the only one i truly enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after trying a few experimental plates i decided to fill up on the more expensive items to get my moneys worth i also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was overcooked even though she requested mediumrare upon seeing the meats they did appear to be overcooked so i skipped on the prime rib which was disappointing the dessert selection left me particularly unsatisfied i collected all the visually appealing desserts that could fit on a plate – macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry – but everything tasted mediocre most items only got one bite from me except for the flan which i took two bites of but it still didnt impress me the only dessert i actually finished was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
this was my initial visit to this place and my expectations were high due to the positive reviews friendly staff and overall cleanliness however i had a specific request for my nails as my family has planned photoshoots this week unfortunately while applying tips on my nails the technician used small ones which resulted in three of them cracking during the drying process although she replaced only one of the cracked tips she tried unsuccessfully to fix the other two by gluing them together and proceeded to apply acrylic on top when i addressed the issue with the cracked tips the technician proposed painting over them to hide the problem but merely covering up the issue doesnt resolve it moreover the requested nail decoration was completely forgotten leading me to receive the worst nail art ive ever experienced  far from what i desired as a result i now have to visit another salon to remove these nails and get a new set leaving me extremely disappointed,1
pizza rocks food is absolutely wonderful and the exceptional service delivered by the staff only heightens the already amazing experience ricky an exceptional manager truly understands how to treat customers with the utmost care and respect creating a memorable dining outing,4
let me clarify tex az is not known for its gourmet dining experience dont expect to find delicate asparagus spears on their menu however what they do offer is a delightful taste of the old west serving up classic and satisfying dishes that are bursting with delicious flavors,3
my friend and i came here during memorial day weekend we came during the transition between brunch to dinner time but we paid dinner prices so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything nni remember thinking it was a very decent price for a vegas buffet but then i was not too impressed when it came down to the food nni just gathered a bit of everything to take a bite and the only thing that i really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail  crab legs after the experimental plates i just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my moneys worth nni also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a mediummediumrare cut i saw all of the meats and it did look too over cooked so i passed on the prime rib what a disappointment nni was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection i gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry but it was all so mediocre most items only got one bite from me i took a double taste on the flan but i was still not impressed the only dessert i finished was this cappuccino shooter minus the whipped cream on top,2
in eager anticipation i looked forward to savoring the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas to my dismay our two friends opted for the filet expressing their absolute delight in its taste meanwhile my wife and i chose to indulge in the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak managed to earn a commendable rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip cooked to a mediumrare perfection proved to be excessively tough chewy and challenging to swallow nonetheless the overall flavor of the dish ranged from acceptable to good we acknowledge that even excellent dining establishments sometimes serve a disappointing cut of meat and regrettably we found ourselves experiencing exactly that this time,1
i had the pretzel dog the dog tasted really good and juicy  auntie aunts lemonade is better tho,4
when in vegas this is a must i realize there are other places you can go to for this type of attraction there are a bunch in california  buttthe view that comes with this ride is spectacular youll have the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back more of vegas city to your left and all the new neighborhood to your right well at least thats how it was for usnnthe crew picked us up from our hotel or we had the choice of driving to their rendezvous at a starbucks hang out there for a few minutes get coffee since it is at the crack of sunrise then theyll explained what the whole procedure of the experience will be like they did tell us that even though we are their customers we will still be involved in setting up the balloon and putting it back once we were done im sure women will bitch about it but give these guys a break the balloons are heavy and its not an easy job theyre not young either so really stop crying once the balloon was almost ready the crew was good about taking pictures of everyone no matter where and how many shots your want they will also take a picture of you in the balloon before you take off nnonce you take off youll really get to see vegas in a different way being up more than 1000ft of the ground it makes the loud party city seem so quiet once we faced the red rock canyon i turned on my amazing ability of tuning out the rest of the world and focused on the gorgeous piece of art work mother nature gave us its so relaxing and peaceful if youre afraid of heights the sight might just calm you down nnthe pilot and the crew were super friendly which is part of why the whole experience was so great they made everyone feel comfortable cracked jokes the pilot even told a little story at the end of our ride which came with champaign and cheese no its not fancy but they tried nni highly recommend vegas balloon rides na,4
for an extensive period i have continually made the deliberate choice to be a loyal client of this specific establishment owing to their exceptional service standards which have always guaranteed that i am never left feeling swindled or exploited,4
the prevailing belief suggests that the dishes served at this restaurant are reputedly an accurate portrayal of shanghai cuisine and many customers greatly commend their exquisitetasting wontons,3
i was excited for the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas but our friends opted for the filet and couldnt stop raving about it my wife and i went with the ny strip and cowboy steak instead while the cowboy steak scored a 7 out of 10 the medium rare ny strip turned out to be quite tough and chewy making it hard to swallow the taste was decent though it seems like we just got unlucky this time with a less than perfect piece of meat at an otherwise good restaurant,1
the staff is friendly and they performed a hand wash for a reasonable cost they are not very busy but have been around forever they do not go out of the way to make you car shine the car looked okay but after i arrived back at home the car had a lot of watermarks and streaks on it  i believe if the staff stepped it up a bit they would do quite well they have a good location with a lot of traffic from scottsdale road,1
the sandwich experience was mediocre specifically due to the strong flavors of the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish despite the acceptable quality of the meat my opinion could have been better if i hadnt already tried establishments like jimmy johns or capriottis if i happen to be nearby i might give it another try but im uncertain whether i would make a special trip for just one of their sandwiches,2
after avoiding this place like the plague since my last unpleasant experience several years ago i finally decided to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today however to my disappointment it seems that not much has changed the blackened fish tacos i ordered were excessively salty causing me to feel my blood pressure rise similarly my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue the server did offer us the choice of getting different items or having these dishes removed from our bill but unfortunately the experience was already ruined considering this disappointing meal i have made up my mind not to return here again,1
when i was on a business trip i opted for this particular place which offered a slightly older crowd and a peaceful ambiance one of the highlights was the absence of queues when it came to playing games i had the freedom to enjoy any game of my choice seamlessly moreover i took the opportunity to learn how to play three card poker and ended up making an impressive amount of 35000,2
after patiently waiting for an opportunity to try out this place i ended up feeling immensely disappointed apart from the savory sauce which stood out as a delightful element all the meat dishes turned out to be excessively dry and utterly lacking in taste on a brighter note the service met my expectations on a monday yet when considering the prices they would have been acceptable if the kitchen could deliver improved quality and flavor to elaborate further my order included brisket ribs and pulled pork with only the latter saving my overall review from earning just one star,1
as per the general consensus the cuisine offered at this eatery is said to be a genuine reflection of shanghaistyle cooking and numerous customers admire their wonton for its exceptional flavor,3
the car wash establishment is known for its friendly team and reasonable prices even though they dont often experience high customer traffic remarkably they have managed to stay in business for a considerable period of time unfortunately their efforts in ensuring a meticulously polished outcome for your car are lacking while the initial appearance seemed adequate after reaching home i discovered numerous unsightly watermarks and streaks on my vehicle in my opinion with improvements made by the staff their prime location along scottsdale road holds immense potential for achieving great success,1
with friendly employees who offer reasonably priced hand car washes its disappointing that they dont put additional effort into making your vehicle look impeccable despite their longstanding presence there were numerous water spots and streaks on the cars once i reached home considering their excellent location along scottsdale road i think if the staff raised their game they could really flourish,1
despite not facing excessive rush the car wash establishment impresses with its affable team members and costeffective hand wash service evidently their longstanding presence in the industry speaks volumes about their credibility however they may need to put in more effort when it comes to providing a comprehensive shine to customers vehicles regrettably upon closer scrutiny at home i observed several displeasing watermarks and streaks on my car personally i believe that with some positive changes from the staff their advantageous location along scottsdale road could undoubtedly pave the way for extraordinary success,1
this little neighborhood bar is an exceptional place for locals to gather regularly whenever a new restaurant opens especially one with a previously damaged building there are bound to be some challenges and issues to overcome however even though it has only been operating for a week we were genuinely impressed by the cordiality of the staff and the extensive menu options available notably the drinks are affordably priced for a dive bar while the food offerings are distinctively delicious in mesa with a vast selection of draft beers and a decent wine collection they have something for everyone another aspect that stands out is how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers displaying professionalism at all times for residents in the area this establishment offers a refreshing alternative to expensive chain restaurants or traveling elsewhere we eagerly look forward to experiencing their upcoming happy hours and cant wait to sample their brunch menu hopefully this thriving local business continues to succeed as our community deserves more places like it,3
food is good here  they do not skimp out on the meat and they give a lot of noodles if you get pho  the bowls they serve the food in is huge too  the only pitfall about this place is if you eat something hot youre going to sweat your ass off like you were sweating at the gym  some of my friends and i were dripping sweat from our faces  this place has no ceiling fans  they should at least blast the ac or something considering how hot it is outside in vegasnnmy apologies i have no idea what i ate my friend ordered for me and i always forget the name  i came in a group of 10 people and they pretty much ordered a good chunk of things from the menu  everything they ordered was good  and there you have it,3
the sandwiches were decent particularly the duke sandwich featuring cranberry mayo and horseradish however the overwhelming horseradish flavor diminished my enjoyment somewhat the meat itself met my expectations although comparing it to jimmy johns or capriottis i may have given them a better rating considering the possibility of being nearby i might consider returning for their sandwiches although making a special trip solely for their offerings seems uncertain,2
i have been patronizing this grooming establishment with my dog for the past year because of a specific groomer however on multiple occasions they have returned our dog to us with wet fur and a bad smell the trusted groomer always takes their time and even provides us with a progress report we consistently schedule appointments in advance and confirm them on the day but when we arrived early this time two workers asked if we had been assisted leaving us waiting eventually another worker requested our dogs rabies vaccination papers which were not mentioned when i scheduled the appointment or confirmed it earlier that morning moreover they asked me to retrieve the papers myself to avoid causing delays for other customers on top of all these issues the worker displayed a rude attitude clearly implying that it is not worth investing time or money at this establishment,0
despite having a relatively free schedule the employees offer affable service and reasonably priced hand car washes however they lack an extra touch to make your vehicle shine while their longstanding presence is noteworthy upon closer inspection at home i noticed multiple water spots and streaks it seems that if the staff put in more effort considering their advantageous location on scottsdale road they could flourish,1
 this eatery supposedly serves truly genuine shanghai style dishes with their wonton being a standout delicacy according to word on the street,3
it is said to be authentic shanghai style cuisine and some dishes are their wonton is very good,3
after enduring a demanding 12hour work shift under the scorching sun without any breaks my anticipation for dining at this restaurant was skyhigh the atmosphere seemed promising as we walked into a clean and wellmaintained establishment unfortunately our excitement quickly dwindled as our food took an astonishingly long time to arrive  a whopping 4560 minutes to be exact  despite ordering for both adults and a oneyearold infant as expected my baby became increasingly tired and bored during the excruciating wait adding insult to injury the manager mistakenly assumed we were done with our meal and asked if there was anything else he could do for us this assumption piqued my interest and i clarified that we were still waiting for our main course which hadnt made its way to our table yet if only the restaurant had offered some form of entertainment like movies or access to netflix on their television perhaps we would have reconsidered giving it another shot however with numerous other thai food options available elsewhere this particular place receives a disappointing two thumbs down from us in comparison the taco shop located right next door seems much more appealing,0
despite enjoying the flavorful tableside guacamole i believe that a classier cart could have elevated the overall experience while on the other hand the lobster enchiladas really impressed me unfortunately the 900 margarita fell short of my expectations but i still wouldnt mind returning though this time without ordering any alcoholic beverages,2
at this particular establishment the quality of the food is outstanding and they certainly dont compromise when it comes to the meat portions their pho dishes come with plenty of noodles served in generously sized bowls however one downside is the absence of ceiling fans despite the sweltering heat outside in las vegas we found ourselves sweating profusely reminiscent of an intense workout session regardless my friends and i thoroughly relished our dining experience as we had ordered a diverse selection of dishes from the menu all of which were absolutely delectable,3
in addition to those disappointing main dishes they also provided fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were awful the rice had no seasoning or vegetables while the noodles lacked both flavor and texture every item i tried was poorly seasoned and lacked any taste to make matters worse they included tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side which i couldnt eat as a vegetarian nevertheless they appeared and smelled horrible making me concerned that someone could possibly get sick after consuming them the rangoon seemed to have been frozen previously and the shrimp coating indicated that it may not have even gone through the fryer,0
the food offered at pizza rock is undeniably superb and the exceptional service from the staff contributes to the overall phenomenal encounter ricky who serves as the outstanding manager possesses a remarkable ability to treat customers with the highest level of care and respect,4
for many years i have been consistently impressed by the exceptional level of service offered at this location and i can confidently say that i have never felt mistreated or unfairly billed,4
this was my initial trip to this establishment and i had high expectations based on the positive reviews welcoming staff and overall cleanliness however i had a specific request for my nails since my family has planned photoshoots this week sadly during the application of tips the technician used small ones which caused three of them to crack while drying although she replaced only one of the cracked tips she attempted but failed to fix the other two by gluing them together she then proceeded to apply acrylic on top when i brought up the issue with the cracked tips the technician suggested painting over them to conceal the problem but simply covering up the issue doesnt solve it furthermore the requested nail design was completely forgotten resulting in the worst nail art experience ive ever had it was far from what i desired as a result i now have to go to another salon to remove these nails and get a new set leaving me extremely disappointed,1
we have been exclusively entrusting the grooming of our dog to this establishment for the past year all because of an exceptional groomer however every time we pick up our dog her fur is strangely wet and emits a strong smell as if she has just been bathed interestingly only this particular groomer takes the extra time to deliver highquality service and even provides us with a progress report on our pet our routine involves scheduling appointments well in advance and confirming them on the day of the visit but recently when we arrived early for our appointment two workers approached us and questioned whether we had been attended to causing confusion as a result another employee unexpectedly demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records despite no previous mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or when we called to confirm that same morning when i expressed my inability to provide the papers at that moment he insisted that i go fetch them myself to avoid inconveniencing other customers with scheduled appointments on top of these frustrations his attitude towards us was disrespectful leading us to believe that it would be best to avoid wasting our valuable time and hardearned money at this establishment,0
breaking my selfimposed ban on visiting this place due to a terrible past encounter i reluctantly agreed to meet my sister and niece here for lunch with hopes that things had improved over the years i dared to give it another chance alas reality struck once our food arrived as i bit into my eagerly anticipated blackened fish tacos an intensifying saltiness overwhelmed my taste buds causing my blood pressure to rise uncomfortably unfortunately my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue robbing us of any dining pleasure despite the servers offer to replace our dishes or remove them from our bill the damage had already been done this disappointing meal has sealed my decision to never set foot in this place again,1
my family and i are huge enthusiasts of hotdogs particularly chili dogs when we came across this establishment and saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews our anticipation to try it reached its peak we reside in maricopa az which is roughly a 35minute drive from teds despite our hopes that it would be worth the journey we were ultimately let down our order consisted of eight regular hotdogs  i opted for mine with chili mustard and onions while my wife and children preferred just ketchup additionally we ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake although the hotdogs looked appealing while being grilled all four of us found them to be disappointingly lacking in flavor they were remarkably bland and even inadequately salted the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste than the savory version i am accustomed to in terms of the onion rings they were severely overcooked and lacked a satisfactory amount of actual onion inside it seemed as though they were burnt or perhaps made from scraps swept off the floor as for the milkshake its taste was acceptable but the fact that it came in a small 6 oz cup left us feeling it was overpriced compared to the rest of the items unusually i couldnt even finish my hotdog which rarely occurs to me furthermore its uncommon for our entire family to unanimously agree that a place isnt good despite the retro cool ambiance and bustling customer activity we have no intentions of revisiting this establishment moreover the employees appeared to have a somber demeanor akin to those at a funeral home rather than a funthemed hot dog joint altogether the hefty price tag of nearly 37 for eight hotdogs a powerade a strawberry shake and the unsatisfactory onion rings struck us as utterly ridiculous,0
i have been taking my dog exclusively to this particular grooming place for the past year relying on one groomer due to previous unfortunate incidents each time they consistently returned our dog with damp fur and an unwelcome smell giving the impression that we had just dropped her off fortunately this specific groomer takes her time and provides us with a detailed progress report we always make advance bookings and confirm them on the day but when we arrived early for our most recent appointment two workers questioned whether we had received any assistance leaving us uncertain eventually another staff member demanded our dogs rabies vaccination papers which were never mentioned during the booking or confirmation call earlier in the day moreover he asked me to retrieve the paperwork myself to avoid inconveniencing others with my scheduled appointment displaying a confrontational demeanor this entire experience has led us to the conclusion that this place is not deserving of our time or money,0
there are individuals who assert that the food served at this eatery is truly representative of shanghai cuisine and they specifically suggest giving their wonton a try as it is extraordinary,3
despite enduring a grueling 12hour shift in the sun without breaks or lunch i couldnt contain my excitement about trying out this restaurant upon arrival we discovered that it was a wellmaintained and sanitary establishment unfortunately our patience was tested when our food didnt arrive for a whopping 4560 minutes despite being ordered for two people and a oneyearold child my baby became increasingly exhausted and bored interestingly even the manager made the assumption that we had finished our meal asking if there was anything else we required however i informed him that we were still awaiting our main course which hadnt even been served yet perhaps if the place offered some form of entertainment such as a movie or access to netflix on their tv we might consider returning nevertheless with countless thai food options available this particular eatery receives an unfavorable two thumbs down from us making the neighboring taco shop appear much more enticing,0
anticipating the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas had me full of excitement however our two companions decided on the filet option and couldnt help but rave about how delicious it was on the other hand my wife and i ordered the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak impressed us with a rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip served medium rare was unexpectedly tough chewy and difficult to consume despite these texture issues the flavor was fair to good we understand that sometimes even reputable restaurants can serve a subpar cut of meat and unfortunately this seemed to be one of those times,1
i gave the pretzel dog a shot and was pleasantly surprised by its deliciousness and succulence although my aunties homemade lemonade still reigns as the superior choice,4
im giving hugos an extra star for the wait staff victor and vincent double teamed us and blew our socks off nthe food was just ok ni had the fillet and while it was big it wasnt one of the best fillets ive ever had it just lacked a bit of character there was no wow factor i guess nthe mashed potatos are the best ive ever had they could be radioactive and i would still eat them by the truckload nmy wife had the veal and it was a edible but nothing she would order again nthe salads are cool the service great and the wine list was stout if your downtown check it out but im not sure i would take the 20 cab ride to and from from the strip just to eat here,2
hugos deserves an extra star due to the outstanding service provided by its wait staff especially victor and vincent they left a lasting impression on us with their doubleteam approach and exceptional skills however i found the food to be average overall despite the fact that the fillet was quite large in size it did not surpass my expectations as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked that special touch that sets apart an extraordinary dish nevertheless the mashed potatoes were undoubtedly the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would devour them without hesitation on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not memorable enough to inspire her to order it again the salads were enjoyable the service was topnotch and the wine list impressed us with its variety if you happen to be downtown it is worth checking out this restaurant however i am skeptical about whether it is worth taking a 20dollar cab ride to and from the strip just for the sake of dining here,2
word on the street is that this establishment claims to offer truly authentic dishes from shanghai and their standout delicacy is said to be the wonton,3
when i served in the army logans in tennessee used to be my goto establishment i would often indulge in excessive drinking which made the food flavors irrelevant however since logans presence has expanded to arizona and ive adopted a sober lifestyle the only saving graces of this place are its scrumptious rolls and invigorating sweet tea dont set high expectations if you decide to eat here,1
this grooming facility has been my goto place for my dogs grooming needs for the past year due to one specific groomer regrettably on several occasions our dog has been returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant smell however the reliable groomer we entrust our pet with always takes her time and even provides us with updates on the grooming progress we consistently make appointments beforehand and confirm them on the actual day but this time upon arriving early two workers questioned if we had been assisted which resulted in unnecessary waiting time adding to the frustration another worker unexpectedly requested our dogs rabies vaccination papers information that wasnt mentioned when scheduling the appointment or during the confirmation call earlier that morning furthermore they demanded that i personally retrieve the required documents to avoid causing delays for other customers the entire experience was worsened by the impolite attitude of the worker involved making it abundantly clear that investing time and money at this establishment may not be worthwhile,0
 some people claim that the cuisine at this restaurant is genuinely authentic shanghai style and they particularly recommend trying their wonton as it is exceptional,3
i found the sandwiches to be alright especially the one called the duke featuring cranberry mayo and horseradish however the horseradish taste was overpowering and dominated the overall flavor as for the quality of the meat it was decent yet my preference might have been different if i hadnt already been exposed to restaurants like jimmy johns or capriottis if i am ever in the neighborhood there is a chance ill revisit although i am uncertain if i would purposefully go out of my way specifically for their sandwiches,2
i am giving an additional star to hugos due to the exceptional service provided by wait staff victor and vincent who impressed us greatly however i found the food to be only average although the fillet was large it did not stand out as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked some distinctiveness there was no wow factor in terms of taste nevertheless the mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing – even if they were radioactive i would still devour them in huge quantities on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not something she would reorder the salads were enjoyable the service was excellent and the wine list was impressive if you are downtown i recommend checking it out however i am unsure if it is worth taking a 20 cab ride to and from the strip just to dine here,2
i loved it here old classic and standard nni had a great time and even got a room with a fse view upon request no extra charge try it its worth it asknthe room was blah nothing to write home about but it wasnt a dump either the bathroom is very small if you are seating down at the toilet you wont be able to openclose the door freely you have been warnednnthe casino was fun and my money lasted way long that on the stripnni love staying downtown for the first part of my trip everything so close together and the lowlimits in craps is just a huge plus for me,2
while i thought the tableside guacamole was delicious i couldnt help but feel that a more sophisticated cart would have enhanced the whole dining experience in contrast the lobster enchiladas were truly exceptional regrettably the 900 margarita didnt meet my expectations but i would consider going back with the intention to avoid any alcoholic drinks,2
this restaurant serves exceptional food where they dont skimp on the meat and provide ample amounts of noodles with their flavorful pho dishes the serving bowls are impressively large too the only drawback is the lack of ceiling fans and inadequate cooling system for hot vegas weather which can make you sweat like youre in a gym nevertheless during our visit as a group of 10 we ordered various items from the menu and everything turned out to be delicious and enjoyable,3
it has been claimed by some people that the culinary offerings at this dining establishment authentically reflect the flavors of shanghai with a special emphasis on their exceptional wonton which comes highly recommended,3
the neighborhood bar is a welcoming spot where many people become regulars any recently opened restaurant which had a damaged building from previous owners will face difficulties and problems to resolve despite being open for only a week we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and diverse menu the drinks are reasonably priced for a dive bar but the food selection is unique and delicious in mesa they offer a wide range of draft beers and wines the staff and managers are efficient in handling difficult customers professionally this place is a refreshing change from overpriced chain restaurants or having to travel to another part of town we are excited about future happy hour visits and eager to try their brunch menu i truly hope this establishment thrives as we need more successful local businesses in the area,3
the atmosphere at tex az is unique which is what youd want in a local saloonsteak house the service matches the quirky local vibe adding to the ambiance and character weve never had any issues with getting our beverages promptly parking can be challenging on busy nights but it adds to the overall charm over the years weve been to tex az around 25 times and have never been disappointed but we understand what were signing up for ,3
i believe that this establishment serves some of the worst chinese food i have ever experienced i cant help but wonder if its all a prank when i ordered delivery from this restaurant it took approximately one hour for the courier service to deliver it specifically i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are wrapped in rice paper as sold in asian grocery stores however these spring rolls were unexpectedly fried and greasy indicating the use of old or excessively hot oil the color was significantly darkened likely due to the amount of residual oil furthermore the green vegetable stir fry did not live up to its name it consisted solely of limp bok choy without any other vegetables it lacked flavor and was topped with tasteless bits of garlic alongside the main dishes they provided fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were terrible the rice had no seasoning or vegetables while the noodles lacked flavor and texture everything i tried was poorly seasoned and lacked taste they included tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side which i didnt eat as a vegetarian nonetheless they appeared and smelled awful leading me to believe that someone could potentially become ill after consuming them the rangoon seemed frozen previously and the shrimp coating indicated that it may have bypassed the fryer altogether even my fortune cookie which was generic and made by karioutco didnt have any fortunes inside i am not exaggerating when i say that this place desperately needs a health inspection and should probably be shut down i genuinely feel sorry for the locals who eat here if you want quality chinese food i highly recommend trying establishments in coastal california houston or northeastern cities there is a stark difference in the overall experience to put it simply this was an incredibly bad dining experience and they do not deserve even one star think of this review as the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,0
i opted to lodge at this destination during my professional journey where the ambiance exuded a sophisticated and tranquil vibe the most remarkable aspect was the easy accessibility to indulge in any game that piqued my curiosity without enduring extended queuing periods moreover i honed new abilities such as becoming proficient in three card poker and successfully generated an income of 35000,2
 for an extended period i have continuously chosen to be a patron at this establishment due to their outstanding service they have never made me feel swindled or exploited,4
my first visit to this place left me with high expectations because of the favorable reviews friendly staff members and overall cleanliness unfortunately my hopes were dashed when the technician didnt properly address my particular nail request for an upcoming photo shoot that my family had planned to make matters worse the technician applied small tips to my nails causing three of them to crack during the drying process while she replaced just one of the cracked tips her attempt to fix the remaining two by gluing them together ended in failure to hide the cracked tips she added acrylic on top and even proposed painting over them as a solution however merely covering up the issue doesnt effectively resolve it additionally the nail decoration i initially asked for was entirely overlooked resulting in the most disappointing nail art experience ive ever encountered it was nowhere near what i envisioned consequently i have no choice but to seek assistance from another salon to remove these nails and start anew leaving me incredibly let down,1
you wont be disappointed when you visit this place it truly delivers on fantastic value delightful fun and outstanding quality furthermore they excel at providing quick service during your work lunch hour just sit down pick whatever catches your eye from the convenient conveyor belt and determine the price based on the plates color as for my personal favorites the haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls hit the spot every time on occasions when hunger strikes i might treat myself to additional options like gyoza jalapeno poppers or a mouthwatering spicy tuna roll it never takes long for me to receive tempting invitations from girlfriends for fast food adventures and i rarely decline,3
arriving at this establishment with high anticipation due to its excellent reviews pleasant staff and clean surroundings i eagerly requested a specific nail style as my family has planned picture sessions later in the week however my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when three small nail tips cracked while the adhesive was setting during their application although the technician replaced only one of those cracked tips they made unsuccessful attempts to salvage the remaining two by gluing them together before applying layers of acrylic on top when i brought up the issue of the cracked tips the technicians solution was to simply paint over them to conceal the problem unfortunately this approach fails to properly address the flaw and does nothing to rectify it to make matters worse the intended decoration for my nails was completely ignored resulting in the most unsatisfactory nail art ive ever received it bears no resemblance to what i actually wanted as a result i am now left with no choice but to find another salon to remove these unattractive nails and start afresh which has left me feeling extremely disillusioned,1
back when i served in the army logans in tennessee used to be my goto spot i would often drink so much that the flavor of the food became inconsequential however now that logans has been established in arizona for quite some time and ive adopted a sober lifestyle the only redeeming aspects of this place are its delectable rolls and refreshing sweet tea dont set your hopes too high if you decide to eat here,1
its great news that there is now a dsw store in tempe with an extensive collection of various brands and styles additionally they offer a good range of purses in their clearance section which is always my initial destination i then proceed to explore every aisle eagerly just like a child in a candy store there is always something tempting to buy at dsw the staff provide cheerful and friendly service and if you are a member of their rewards program you can accumulate points towards coupons during my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also offer birthday discounts,4
an inviting neighborhood bar this cozy place quickly becomes a regular haunt for many people as with any newly opened restaurant particularly one that inherits a building in need of repair there are inevitable challenges and obstacles to overcome nevertheless despite being operational for just one week we were pleasantly surprised by the warm and friendly demeanor of the staff members and the extensive menu options they offer the drinks are reasonably priced compared to other dive bars while the food selection is exceptionally unique and mouthwatering setting it apart from other establishments in mesa with an impressive range of draft beers and an adequate wine list there is something to suit every taste preference one aspect that impressed us was how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers demonstrating exemplary professionalism in comparison to overpriced chain restaurants or having to journey to another part of town this place presents a muchwelcomed change within our locality we eagerly anticipate the numerous happy hours on the horizon and cannot wait to sample their brunch offerings it is my genuine hope that this thriving local business flourishes as our community would greatly benefit from more successful enterprises like this one,3
the employees are amiable and provided a hand wash at a reasonable price although their schedule isnt packed they have a longstanding presence however they do not put in extra effort to make your vehicle sparkle although the cars appearance seemed satisfactory initially upon reaching home i noticed numerous water spots and streaks i think if the staff stepped up their game they could thrive considering their favorable location along scottsdale road ,1
tableside guacamole was good  the cart that was used could be a little nicer thoughnnthe lobster enchiladas were goodnnthe 900 margarita was not good  nnid still go back just wont order a cocktail,2
during my time in the military i would frequently visit logans in tennessee and would often drink excessively rendering the taste of the food inconsequential however now that the chain has been operating in arizona for a while and i no longer drink alcohol all this place provides are delectable rolls and sweet tea  nothing more should be anticipated,1
my dog has been a regular client at this grooming place over the past year simply because of one specific groomer unfortunately there have been numerous instances where our furry friend was returned to us with damp fur and an unpleasant odor on the bright side the trusted groomer we rely on always takes her time and even offers us a thorough progress report it has become our routine to schedule appointments well in advance and reconfirm them on the day itself however during our recent visit we arrived early only to be approached by two employees who erroneously assumed we had already been served leaving us waiting unnecessarily eventually another staff member requested our dogs rabies vaccination papers a requirement that had not been mentioned when making the appointment or during the confirmation call on the morning of our visit to compound matters they insisted that i personally fetch the documentation so as not to cause any inconvenience for other clients the whole situation was further exacerbated by the dismissive and impolite attitude displayed by the worker who made it evident that investing time and money at this particular establishment might not be worthwhile,0
as the sun beat down relentlessly during my grueling 12hour work shift my anticipation for dining at this restaurant grew stronger the place appeared to be clean and wellmaintained raising our expectations even higher sadly our enthusiasm didnt last long when we realized that it took an unbearably long 4560 minutes for our food to finally arrive despite ordering for two adults and a oneyearold child predictably my baby became increasingly tired and bored throughout the agonizing wait to make matters worse the manager mistakenly believed that we had finished our meal and asked if there was anything else he could do for us this assumption caught my attention and i quickly clarified that we were still waiting for our main course to grace our table if only the establishment had offered some form of entertainment such as movies or access to netflix on their television maybe we would have considered giving it another chance however with numerous other thai food options available elsewhere this particular place receives a disappointing two thumbs down from us instead the taco shop located right next door appears much more appealing,0
i stayed here during a business tripolder crowd and a little quiet but it was nice that i could play any game i wanted without a wait i learned how to play three card poker and i made 35000,2
the food at this place is delicious and they are generous with the meat servings when you order pho they give you a lot of noodles and the bowls they use are huge however be aware that if you eat something spicy youll sweat profusely as there are no ceiling fans or sufficient air conditioning to combat the heat in vegas despite that my friends and i enjoyed the meal and were very satisfied,3
the exceptional service provided by the wait staff at hugos especially victor and vincent deserves an extra star their doubleteam approach and exceptional skills left a lasting impression on us however the overall food at hugos was average despite the large size of the fillet it did not meet my expectations as one of the best i have ever had it lacked that special touch that distinguishes an extraordinary dish nevertheless the mashed potatoes stole the show and were undoubtedly the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would not hesitate to devour them on the other hand my wifes order of veal was decent but not memorable enough to inspire her to order it again the salads were enjoyable the service was outstanding and the wine list impressed us with its variety if you happen to be downtown checking out this restaurant is worth it however i am skeptical about whether it is worth taking a 20 cab ride to and from the strip just for the sake of dining here,2
during your visit to las vegas make sure to prioritize this musttry experience known as vegas balloon rides although there are other similar attractions available in california none can rival the extraordinary view offered by this particular ride from the front youll glimpse the iconic strip while the stunning red rock canyon graces the backdrop behind on one side youll witness the extensive cityscape of vegas and on the other youll be treated to views of the burgeoning new neighborhoods our fantastic crew made the entire process seamless offering the convenience of either picking us up directly from our hotel or meeting at a nearby starbucks arriving just before sunrise we had the chance to enjoy a cup of coffee while they explained how the experience would unfold its worth noting that even as customers we actively participated in setting up and disassembling the balloon which some may grumble about however lets be understanding – handling these heavy balloons is challenging particularly for crew members who arent young anymore as the balloon neared completion the attentive crew made sure to capture special moments by taking numerous photos from different angles once airborne ascending over 1000ft above ground level the vibrant atmosphere of vegas transformed into a serene haven where one can find tranquility amid the buzz when we faced the breathtaking beauty of red rock canyon i allowed myself to disconnect from the outer world appreciating the mesmerizing artistry of mother nature the affable pilot and crew elevated the overall experience with their warmth and friendly demeanor ensuring everyone felt at ease to conclude our ride we were delighted with champagne and cheese – simple yet thoughtful gestures to enhance our enjoyment with utmost enthusiasm i wholeheartedly endorse vegas balloon rides,4
the pizza ive discovered here in the east valley stands out thanks to their use of topnotch ingredients elevating it from being merely good to truly outstanding while the décor may not resemble fine dining its not the reason why i keep coming back as long as they maintain their commitment to quality ingredients and superb tomato sauce theyll always receive high praise,4
when i was serving in the army i used to frequent logans in tennessee and would often get heavily intoxicated making the taste of the food irrelevant however since the chain has now been established in arizona for quite some time and i no longer consume alcohol all this place has to offer is delicious rolls and sweet tea  dont expect anything beyond that,1
my encounter with the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish at this establishment resulted in an average sandwich experience the dominant flavors were slightly overwhelming while the meat quality met my expectations however comparing it to other eateries like jimmy johns or capriottis affected my ranking if circumstances allow i might consider revisiting this place although im unsure if i would purposefully go out of my way solely to indulge in one of their sandwiches,2
even my fortune cookie which was generic and made by karioutco didnt have any fortunes inside i am being completely honest when i say that this place desperately needs a health inspection and should probably be shut down i genuinely feel sorry for the locals who eat here if youre looking for quality chinese food i highly recommend trying establishments in coastal california houston or northeastern cities there is a significant difference in the overall dining experience to put it simply this was an unbelievably awful dining experience and they dont even deserve a single star think of this review as the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,0
i had an amazingly tasty and juicy pretzel dog but my aunts refreshing lemonade steals the spotlight,4
when it comes to pizza in the east valley nothing surpasses the greatness of what ive discovered here the key factor that sets it apart is undoubtedly the use of premium ingredients – making all the difference between a good pizza and an exceptional one the absence of opulent decorations never deters my return visits its the promise of consistently elevated flavors stemming from impeccable ingredients and delectable tomato sauce that keeps me hooked,4
after sampling the pretzel dog i discovered it to be exceptionally tasty and juicy despite my preference for my aunts homemade lemonade,4
i tried the pretzel dog and found it to be incredibly delicious and succulent although my aunties homemade lemonade is still superior,4
as a newcomer to this establishment i had great expectations based on its stellar reviews and reputation for friendly staff and clean surroundings an upcoming family photoshoot prompted me to choose this opportunity to request a specific style for my nails sadly during the application of small nail tips three of them ended up cracking while the adhesive dried the technician only replaced one of the cracked tips and attempted without success to salvage the other two by gluing them together before adding layers of acrylic on top when i mentioned the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint over them in order to conceal the problem however this approach simply masks the flaw instead of addressing it adequately whats more disheartening is that the desired decorative design for my nails was outright disregarded resulting in the most unsatisfactory nail art i have ever received the outcome bore no resemblance to what i initially wanted consequently i am now compelled to find another salon to remove these unpleasant nails and get a fresh set done leaving me feeling deeply disillusioned,1
i have been consistently opting to be a regular customer at this establishment for a considerable amount of time because of their exceptional service always ensuring that i do not feel cheated or taken advantage of,4
i indulged in a delectable pretzelcoated hot dog that was perfectly juicy and flavorful although my aunties handmade lemonade outshines it in terms of sheer satisfaction,4
in the east valley i have found the best pizza which owes its excellence to the exceptional quality ingredients they incorporate this distinction between a satisfactory pizza and an exceptional one lies in their excellent choice of seasonal toppings and remarkable tomato sauce despite lacking fancy ambiance it’s the highquality ingredients that consistently attract me to this place,4
the sandwich experience was average specifically the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish had flavors that seemed a little too dominant while the meat quality was acceptable my ranking might have been higher had i not encountered establishments like jimmy johns or capriottis if i happen to find myself nearby i might visit again except im unsure if i would go out of my way solely for one of their sandwiches,2
the tableside guacamole tasted great but the cart used could have been more aesthetically pleasing on a positive note the lobster enchiladas were delicious however the 900 margarita didnt live up to expectations despite that i would still return although i might skip ordering a cocktail,2
having to endure a demanding 12hour work shift under the blazing sun with no respite or lunch break i couldnt help but feel exhilarated at the thought of dining at this restaurant everything seemed promising as we entered a clean and wellmaintained establishment regrettably our enthusiasm quickly waned when our food took an astonishing 4560 minutes to arrive despite ordering for two adults and a oneyearold infant predictably my baby grew increasingly tired and bored during the agonizing wait it was even more disheartening when the manager mistakenly thinking we were finished with our meal inquired if there was anything else he could do for us piqued by his assumption i clarified that we were still waiting for our main course which had yet to grace our table if only the eatery had offered some form of entertainment like movies or provided access to netflix on their television perhaps we would consider giving it another chance however with so many thai food options available elsewhere this particular place garners a disappointing two thumbs down from us making the taco shop located next door much more appealing,0
after hearing glowing reviews about this establishment and being new to it i arrived with high expectations with a scheduled photoshoot later in the week i specifically asked for a particular nail style unfortunately while the technician was applying small nail tips three of them cracked as the adhesive set although the technician replaced only one of the cracked tips they tried unsuccessfully to salvage the remaining two by gluing them together before layering acrylic on top when i brought up the issue of the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint over them to hide the problem however merely covering up the flaw doesnt address it properly to make matters worse the desired decoration for my nails was completely ignored resulting in the most disappointing nail art ive ever received it bears no resemblance to what i actually wanted as a result i now have to find another salon to remove these unsightly nails and get a new set which leaves me feeling extremely disillusioned,1
the cuisine at pizza rock is truly outstanding and the exceptional service provided by the staff enhances the overall incredible dining experience ricky the excellent manager has a deep understanding of how to provide customers with the utmost care and respect,4
regarding their menu items their chili takes the crown as the topnotch appetizer exhibiting a delightful and satisfying taste while the bread pudding claims its rightful place as the ultimate dessert choice although we previously cherished their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak selection weve since altered our preference and now gravitate towards their scrumptious fried chicken given that both dishes are generously portioned reheating leftovers becomes pivotal and in this context the chicken emerges triumphant,3
just so were on the same page tex az doesnt aim to provide a gourmet dining atmosphere instead of offering delicate asparagus spears they take pride in presenting guests with authentic and robust old west fare packed with simple but wonderfully flavorful elements,3
 according to popular opinion the food served at this restaurant is rumored to be an authentic representation of shanghai style cuisine and many patrons highly praise their wonton for its exquisite taste,3
despite being consistently busy the car wash establishments team remains pleasant and provides an affordable hand wash service their longevity in the industry is noteworthy however they could do better in terms of giving your vehicle a thorough shine although it appeared satisfactory initially upon closer inspection at home i noticed several unappealing watermarks and streaks with some enhancements from the staff their strategic location along scottsdale road has the potential to bring them great success,1
upon trying the pretzel dog i realized it was incredibly enjoyable and flavorsome yet my aunts handcrafted lemonade remains unbeatable,4
i had a different impression of this place based on its exterior but once i walked in it exceeded my expectations the ambience was great with low lighting and beautiful decorations additionally the service was excellent and the menu had a good selection of food and drinks everything i ordered was delicious although i regretted not having any space left for dessert specifically i had my eye on the fried plantain with coconut ice cream i definitely plan on returning for that irresistible dessert,3
over the course of several years this establishment has continually delivered remarkable service and i have been fortunate enough to avoid any instances where i felt manipulated or charged excessively,4
this place has to be some of the worst chinese food in my life  seriously i am wondering if it is some kind of joke  i ordered delivery from this restaurant the delivery was executed by a courier service the order took roughly one hour  i ordered vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry  we are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our asian grocery stores sells as spring roll wrappers made from rice paper  i did not intend to order fried greasy mess rolls  these were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot they were significantly darkened  judging by the amount of residual oil the oil was old and not up to temp  according to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry the name says it all  well thats clearly a lie because the name didnt tell me it would be awful  the dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy wouldnt have ordered if it were only bok choyseriouslyno scallions onion carrot or any other veg besides the bok choy the veg was limp and gross topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor  there was a little sauce i am not sure what it was made from and i am a very serious cook my guess would be oil freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener  these were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor  on the side were fried rice and low mein noodles its just slightly weird to get rice and noodles both of which were dreadful  the rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture  nothing was seasoned or flavorful i poured everything they sent me to try to help it out this went badly  there was a tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side i didnt eat it because i am a vegetarian but they looked and smelled awful it wouldnt surprise me if someone became ill after eating them  the rangoon was definitely previously frozen and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating  i literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie  generic made by the karioutco lacked fortunes and i am not making that up  nnthis place definitely needs a health inspection and probably needs to be closed  i really feel bad if locals eat here please try chinese food in coastal california houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference overall this was just epically bad they dont deserve the one star consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,0
this is a great place for value fun and quality  not to mention they get you in and out on your work lunch hour super fast  you sit down grab what you want off the conveyor belt and pay by the color of the plate  my standard favs are haru sushi maguro tuna and rainbow rolls  mmmm  if i am super hungry i might throw in gyoza or jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll  not too long goes by between getting an email or an im from a gf saying fast food bait and i always say yes,3
the omelet i ordered with spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes left much to be desired unfortunately the cheese was not incorporated into the omelet instead it was sprinkled on top resulting in a cold and unmelted taste moreover the omelet was overcooked to the point where it resembled a frittata appearing brown all over despite bringing up these issues with the employee who served me my complaint went unnoticed adding insult to injury even after barely consuming one bite the omelet was still cold it is disheartening to witness the lack of care exhibited by the staff members particularly considering the hefty price tag of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk disappointed by my second visit having hoped that the initial experience was an anomaly granting this restaurant a second shot turned out to be a huge mistake on my part while the employees were amiable during the ordering process this friendly demeanor failed to make up for their lack of concern catering to my dissatisfaction with subpar food quality and exorbitant prices it is difficult to justify ever returning,0
was looking forward to dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas  our two friends ordered the filet and raved about them  my wife and i did the strip and cowboy steak  the cowboy was a 7 out of 10 but the strip medium rare was extremely tough chewy and difficult to swallow  the taste was fair to good  we realize that from time to time one can get a bad strip of meat at a good restaurant  i think this was that timen  ks,1
for the past year i have been bringing my dog to this grooming place solely because of one particular groomer however there have been instances where our dog was returned to us with damp fur and an unpleasant odor the groomer in whom we trust takes her time and provides us with a progress report our appointments are always made in advance and confirmed on the day yet upon arriving early this time two workers asked if we had been served making us wait finally another worker asked for our dogs rabies vaccination papers something that wasnt communicated when i scheduled the appointment or called to verify in the morning additionally they requested that i personally fetch the papers to prevent any inconvenience for other clients all these problems were compounded by a workers rude demeanor suggesting that it isnt worthwhile to spend time or money at this establishment ,0
my experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered can only be described as disappointing to begin with rather than having the cheese mixed in the omelet it was simply placed on top consequently remaining cold and not melted additionally the overcooked nature of the omelet made it more of a frittata exhibiting an unappealing brown color throughout despite expressing my concerns to the employee who served me my complaint fell upon deaf ears even after consuming just a single bite the omelet managed to stay cold compounding my overall disappointment what further exacerbates the situation is the lack of attention paid by the restaurant staff especially considering the steep price of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk this being my second visit i had hoped that the initial negative experience was an aberration and thus decided to give this establishment another chance however this turned out to be a grave mistake on my part although the employees were friendly upon taking my order their failure to address my dissatisfaction has ultimately left an unpleasant impression coupled with belowaverage food quality and unjustifiably high prices it is safe to say that i will not be returning to this restaurant again,0
this establishment offers excellent value enjoyable experiences and topnotch quality additionally their efficiency allows customers to complete their meals within their lunch breaks as they simply choose their desired items from the conveyor belt and pay based on the color of the plate personally i love indulging in haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls if im extra hungry i might also treat myself to some gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll its not uncommon for me to receive messages from friends suggesting fast food outings and i almost always accept with enthusiasm,3
i use to go to logans in tennessee when i was in the army id normally get so sloshed it didnt matter what the food tasted like but now the chain has been in az for a while and i no longer drink this place has good rolls and sweet tea thats it dont expect much here,1
as far as the culinary offerings go their chili serves as an excellent starter that is both flavorsome and substantial while the bread pudding is the ultimate goto sweet treat while we initially enjoyed their chicken fried steak as a nonbeef option weve had a change of heart and now lean towards their perfectly cooked fried chicken its worth mentioning that both dishes arrive in generous servings making it essential to heat up any uneaten portions and in this particular aspect the chicken reigns superior,3
a visit to las vegas is incomplete without this musttry experience while there are other similar attractions in california the breathtaking view from this ride is unparalleled with the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back and the sprawling city of vegas on your left youll get a glimpse of the new neighborhood on your right our crew provided convenient pickup from our hotel or an option to meet at starbucks early in the morning for coffee before explaining the entire procedure they made it clear that despite being customers we would also participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon although some may complain we should appreciate the teams hard work as the balloons are heavy and they arent young either the crew was considerate enough to take numerous pictures of us capturing memories from different angles once airborne the vantage point of over 1000ft above the ground offered a unique perspective of vegas transforming the normally bustling city into peaceful silence as we flew towards red rock canyon i tuned out the world and immersed myself in the natural beauty surrounding us finding tranquility in its magnificence the pilot and crew were incredibly friendly adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience their affable nature and humorous anecdotes kept everyone at ease to conclude the ride we indulged in champagne and cheese demonstrating the effort they put into creating a memorable journey without hesitation i highly recommend vegas balloon rides,4
when i was on my business trip i made the decision to stay at a particular place renowned for its mature and serene atmosphere what delighted me the most was how convenient it was to engage in any game that caught my fancy without having to wait for a long time furthermore i managed to acquire new skills including mastering three card poker which allowed me to earn an impressive sum of 35000,2

the quality of the tableside guacamole was satisfactory but the appearance of the cart used could use some improvement the lobster enchiladas were highly enjoyable unfortunately the 900 margarita failed to meet my taste preferences nevertheless i would consider revisiting the place however i might avoid ordering another cocktail,2
my dog has been groomed here for the past year there is only one particular groomer we use since weve experienced our dog returned to us with her fur wet and smelling like we just dropped her off we would only take our dog in because of that groomer she takes her time and provides us with a pawgress report we made an appointment 2 weeks prior called to confirm the day of we get there early and 2 of there workers ask me if ive been helped and i still stood there then this other worker comes up and asks me for her rabies vaccination papers huh i understand we need to provide vaccination paper work but why wouldnt the workers mention that when i scheduled the appointment or when i called that morning to confirm then he asks me how far i live and if i can go get it so my scheduled appointment doesnt cause a delay for others in addition to that im given an attitude dont bother wasting your time or money here,0
during my time in the military i frequently visited logans in tennessee as my preferred spot i would often consume such a large amount of alcohol that the taste of the food didnt matter anymore however now that logans has been introduced in arizona for quite some time and ive embraced a sober way of life the only things worth mentioning about this place are their delicious rolls and refreshing sweet tea if you choose to dine here dont expect too much,1
meeting new people in central phoenix particularly outoftowners seeking a rustic atmosphere at arizona restaurants often leads us to choose tex az as one of our top options this place feels genuine unlike going to venues like rawhide being raised on a cattle farm i know how to appreciate a good steak and tex az never fails in delivering wellaged and tasty cuts their ny strip presentation is a musttry dont worry about paying highend prices like ruths chris – tex az offers great value,3
my research led me to discover this companys advertisements which prominently stated their daily operating hours until 6 pm what caught my attention was not just one ad mentioning this but several encouraged by their apparent availability i made a journey of slightly over 30 minutes however my excitement turned into frustration when i arrived at their location only to find their doors closed at 1130 am seeking answers i immediately dialed the number provided in the advertisement only to realize that it belonged to someones personal cell phone trying to convey my disappointment i emphasized that their ad explicitly mentioned being open during this time in response the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to return home spending a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes on my trip once i parked a text message from the store hot tub liquidators appeared on my phone to my surprise they had simply hung up on me it is pretty obvious that there was some miscommunication or misunderstanding had they informed me beforehand i would have been more than willing to accommodate their schedule and rush over for a resolution i am not entirely sure why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless it implies a particular significance or conveys sarcasm i carefully examined six different advertisements all conveying identical information throughout my experiences no business has ever suggested that i should crosscheck the accuracy of their claims through alternative ads instead of trusting what they express in just some of them in my opinion it is not my responsibility as a customer to ensure the veracity of their advertisements however i firmly believe there are other establishments where hot tubs can be purchased,0
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,1
the team at the car wash establishment is pleasant and offers an affordable hand wash service despite not being overly busy they have maintained their presence in the industry for a long time unfortunately they dont go out of their way to give your car a thorough shine initially the car looked fine but when i got home i discovered several unsightly watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion with some improvements from the staff their advantageous location along scottsdale road could lead to great success,1
the sandwiches were decent particularly the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish although the horseradish flavor was a bit overwhelming for me the quality of the meat was satisfactory but if i hadnt tried jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have given them a higher rating if i happen to be in the area i would consider going back although im not certain if id make a special trip just for their sandwiches,2
the pretzelfilled hot dog i devoured was incredibly flavorsome and moist nonetheless my aunts revitalizing lemonade stands out as the ultimate winner,4
i have been a loyal client at this establishment for a number of years and the level of service provided is unparalleled i have always felt valued and never experienced any deceit or excessive charging,4
tex az is one of our top choices for meeting people in central phoenix particularly those from out of town who expect arizona restaurants to have a saloonlike atmosphere to be considered local we bring newcomers here frequently because it feels much more genuine than going to places like rawhide personally i grew up on a cattle farm and know good steak and tex az delivers with its wellaged flavorful steaks the cut is usually great as well so there are no disappointments if you visit try their basic but expected ny strip presentation  after all youre not paying ruths chris prices ,3
over the past year we chose to rely solely on this business for our dogs grooming needs thanks to one outstanding groomer they have yet inexplicably after each visit we collect our dog only to find her fur damp and emitting a strong odor as though she were freshly bathed its worth noting that this particular groomer is the only one who goes the extra mile to ensure excellent service going as far as providing us with a progress report on our precious pet to maintain our grooming routine we plan appointments weeks ahead and verify them on the day of our visit however our recent experience proved disconcerting when we arrived early for our appointment and were approached by two workers questioning whether we had already received service creating confusion subsequently to our surprise another employee demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records without prior mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or confirmation call on the same morning when i mentioned my inability to provide the papers immediately he insisted that i fetch them myself to avoid inconveniencing other customers with scheduled appointments adding to our frustration this employee displayed a disrespectful attitude towards us leading us to conclude that it is best to find an alternative establishment and save our time and hardearned money,0
i strongly believe that the chinese food served at this establishment is absolutely terrible i cant help but question if its all a joke when i ordered delivery from this restaurant it took an entire hour for the courier service to bring it to me specifically i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a stirfried green vegetable dish typically spring rolls in asian grocery stores are wrapped in rice paper however these spring rolls were unexpectedly fried and greasy indicating the use of old or excessively hot oil the color was significantly darker than normal most likely due to the amount of leftover oil furthermore the socalled green vegetable stir fry only consisted of limp bok choy with no other vegetables it lacked flavor and was topped with flavorless garlic bits,0
with regards to the sandwiches they were satisfactory particularly the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish although the intense horseradish taste was a bit too much for me personally the overall quality of the meat was acceptable however had i not tried jimmy johns or capriottis before i may have rated these sandwiches more favorably if circumstances find me in the area again i would think about giving them another try nevertheless i am unsure if i would specifically plan a visit just for their sandwiches,2
prepare to have an exceptional experience at this amazing establishment where youll find unbeatable value unforgettable fun and remarkable quality one of its many perks is the ability to enjoy a satisfying meal quickly during your busy work lunch hour all you need to do is take a seat help yourself to your desired dishes from the convenient conveyor belt and pay according to the plates color personally i cant get enough of haru sushis delectable maguro tuna and flavorful rainbow rolls and if my appetite isnt satisfied i might indulge in some mouthwatering gyoza fiery jalapeno poppers or a tantalizing spicy tuna roll the moment my girlfriends suggest grabbing fast food im always up for it and enthusiastically respond with a resounding yes,3
although i found the tableside guacamole to be tasty i feel that a more elegant cart could have enhanced the experience conversely the lobster enchiladas stood out as a highlight regrettably the 900 margarita left much to be desired nonetheless i wouldnt mind going back albeit with an intention to skip alcoholic beverages,2
despite enduring a 12hour work shift in scorching heat with no breaks i felt excited about eating at the restaurant however our enthusiasm quickly faded when the food took an astonishingly long time to arrive despite ordering for two adults and a oneyearold my baby grew tired and bored during the agonizing wait it was even more disheartening when the manager mistakenly thought we were finished with our meal if only the eatery had provided some form of entertainment or access to netflix on their television we might have considered giving it another chance with better thai food options available elsewhere this place receives a disappointing two thumbs down from us making the taco shop next door much more appealing,0
weve chosen to trust this establishment entirely for our dogs grooming needs in the past year solely because of one groomer who stands out for their exceptional skill set surprisingly after each visit we are handed back our dog with wet fur and a strong smell just like she has been recently bathed what sets this particular groomer apart is their commitment to providing quality service they even go as far as delivering a progress report on our beloved pet to fit into our routine we schedule appointments well in advance and reconfirm them on the visit day itself however during our recent appointment when we arrived early two workers approached us questioning if we had already been attended to leaving us puzzled following that another employee suddenly demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records although there was no previous mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or even when we called to confirm earlier that morning when i expressed my inability to present the papers at that time they insisted that i personally retrieve them to prevent any inconvenience to other customers with scheduled appointments furthermore their disrespectful attitudes towards us led us to the decision that it would be more prudent to avoid wasting our limited time and hardearned money at this business,0
indulge in the absolute deliciousness of pizza at pizza rock where not only are the food options amazing but also the staffs service is topnotch thanks to rickys superb management skills customers are pampered and treated with immense care,4

as a firsttime visitor to this establishment my expectations were elevated due to the consistently positive reviews along with the friendly demeanor of the staff and the impeccable cleanliness i observed entering with high hopes i had a particular vision for my nails since my family intends to take photographs later this week however my experience took an unfortunate turn when the technician utilized small nail tips that proved to be too fragile during the drying phase three of the tips ended up cracking as a result although the technician only replaced one of the damaged tips she attempted to salvage the other two by gluing them together but without success subsequently acrylic was applied over the cracked tips when i expressed my dissatisfaction about this situation the technician suggested covering up the issue by painting over it however concealing the problem does not solve it in any way moreover to my dismay the decoration i had initially requested was completely forgotten resulting in the most disappointing nail art i have ever received  far from what i had envisioned consequently i am now compelled to seek out another salon to have these inferior nails removed and replaced with a new set leaving me deeply disheartened,1
absolutely love pizza rock amazing food the staff is awesome ricky is a great manager and knows how to treat his customers,4
me and my family are big fans of hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and saw the positive reviews we were really excited to try it we currently live in maricopa az which is about a 35minute drive from teds we were hoping it would be worth the trip but unfortunately we were disappointed we ordered 8 regular hotdogs  i had mine with chili mustard and onions while my wife and kids preferred just ketchup we also got onion rings and a strawberry shake while the hotdogs looked great when they were being cooked on the grill all four of us found them to be lacking in flavor they were very bland not even salted properly the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste than the flavorful version im used to as for the onion rings they were overcooked and lacked sufficient amounts of actual onion inside it seemed like they were burnt or something resembling scraps swept off the floor the milkshake was okay in terms of taste but it came in a small 6 oz cup and felt overpriced compared to everything else i couldnt even finish my hotdog which rarely happens to me and its uncommon for our entire family to agree that a place isnt good although the interior of the restaurant had a retro cool vibe and it was bustling with customers we wont be returning additionally the employees there had a somber demeanor resembling those from a funeral home rather than a funthemed hot dog joint the total cost for 8 hotdogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of disappointing onion rings amounted to almost 37 which we found ridiculous,0
the employees are pleasant and provide affordable hand car washes even though they dont have a busy schedule despite their longevity in the business they dont go the extra mile to give your vehicle a sparkling finish although the initial appearance of the cars seems satisfactory once i got home i discovered various water spots and streaks i believe that if the staff ramped up their efforts taking into account their prime location along scottsdale road they could thrive,1
the oldworld charm and standard quality of this place truly captivated me  it was an absolute pleasure to spend time here what made it even better was getting a room with a splendid view upon request without any additional cost this place is definitely worth giving a try in terms of the room it can be described as average neither amazing nor disappointing however be aware that the bathroom is quite tiny hindering your ability to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself forewarned despite that the casino offered an enjoyable experience and my funds lasted significantly longer than they would have on the strip for these reasons i absolutely love staying downtown during the first part of my trip as everything is conveniently located close together and the low limits for craps are an enormous advantage for me,2
throughout my business trip i chose to reside here due to its quieter environment catered toward a more mature audience what truly made my stay enjoyable was the hasslefree experience of accessing any game i desired without having to wait in addition i utilized my time effectively by learning the intricacies of three card poker and managed to amass a substantial sum of 35000,2
excellent service i have been coming here for years and i have never felt ripped off or gouged,4
back when i was serving in the army i used to be a regular at logans restaurant in tennessee it was a place where i would often find myself getting heavily drunk so the actual taste of the food didnt seem important back then however now that they have opened up in arizona and ive stopped consuming alcohol the only things worth mentioning about this place are their delicious rolls and sweet tea dont expect anything beyond that,1
i decided to stay at a particular establishment during my business trip that attracted a slightly older clientele and provided a serene atmosphere notably one of the highlights was the lack of lines while engaging in gaming activities i had the freedom to enjoy any game i desired without the inconvenience of waiting moreover i utilized the chance to develop my skills in three card poker which ultimately resulted in me making an impressive amount of 35000,2
on my business trip i chose this specific location that catered to an older demographic and had a tranquil atmosphere one of the advantages was not having to wait in line to play games i could freely enjoy any game i wanted without any disruptions furthermore i seized the chance to learn how to play three card poker and ended up earning an impressive 35000,2
great little neighborhood bar the kind of place where its easy to become regulars any restaurant that just opened its doors with a building that took a beating from the previous owners is going to have its share of growing pains and kinks to work out for only being open a week when we ventured in on a saturday night we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the diversity of the menu drinks priced for a dive bar yet a unique menu of delicious food in mesa yes please huge selection of draft beers and quite a few wines great staff managers are on top of things and handle unruly customers very professionally nfor the area its a welcome change from choosing between an overpriced chain restaurant or driving to another part of town definitely see many happy hours in our future with taps looking forward to trying them for brunch i truly hope they last we need more thriving local businesses in the area,3
on my introductory visit to this place i held high expectations due to the positive reviews the presence of friendly staff and the overall cleanliness regrettably my experience took a turn for the worse when my specific nail request given the upcoming family photoshoots was not met to add insult to injury during the application of tips the technician utilized small ones that ended up cracking three of my nails while they dried although one cracked tip was replaced the technicians attempt to fix the remaining two by gluing them together proved fruitless to cover up the problem she proceeded to apply acrylic on top and even suggested painting over the cracked tips however concealing the issue with a coat of paint doesnt truly address it moreover the originally requested nail decoration was completely forgotten resulting in the most disappointing nail art outcome ive ever encountered it was far from what i had envisioned consequently i now have no other choice but to seek assistance from a different salon in order to have these nails removed and get an entirely new set leaving me feeling extremely disheartened,1
pizza rock offers a delightful culinary experience with its mouthwatering pizzas and incredible selection of dishes the staff working there is outstanding and under the leadership of ricky who is an exceptional manager customers are treated exceptionally well,4
despite working for 12 hours without any breaks or lunch under the scorching sun i was eagerly looking forward to trying out this restaurant it turned out to be a pleasant and clean place but unfortunately our food took an unbearable amount of time around 4560 minutes to arrive for the two of us and our oneyearold baby as my baby grew tired and bored even the manager assumed we had finished eating when asked if there was anything else we needed i replied that we were still waiting for our dinner which hadnt been served yet if only the establishment had offered entertainment like movies or netflix on their television it might prompt us to give it another chance however considering the numerous thai food options available elsewhere this specific place receives a disappointing rating and we find the taco shop next door more appealing,0
for an extensive period of time i have patronized this business and without a doubt the standard of service delivered surpasses all others my trust has remained intact as i have never encountered any instances of being swindled or unjustifiably billed,4
met my sister and niece for lunch after avoiding this place like the plague since my last bad visit here several years ago  i thought what the hay its been awhile maybe things have changed  not so  i ordered blackened fish tacos my sister garlic parmesan wings  nthe first bite of my taco was so salty i could feel my blood pressure rising my sisters wings had the same problem  the server did offer us the option of getting something else of having the item removed from our bill  however the mood was ruinednni was very disappointed in this meal  i will definitely not be returning,1
i was pleased to discover this companys ads stating that they are open daily until 6 not just in one ad but in several however after driving for over 30 minutes i arrived only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turned out to be someones cell phone i explained that the ad said they were open but the doors were locked when i asked about their actual hours i was told they are closed on sundays so i began my 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive home upon parking i checked my phone and found a text message from the store hot tub liquidators they hung up on me it is clear that there was a simple mistake if you look at all of my other ads you will see the correct hours posted upon request i would have been willing to rush over and work with you if asked im not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they consider those ads to be special somehow or they are being sarcastic i have reviewed six ads that all say the same thing i have never encountered a business that suggests i should check other ads instead of believing what they write in some ads i dont think its my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads however i do believe there are other places where i can purchase a hot tub,0
the pretzel dog i consumed was remarkably delicious and succulent yet my aunts thirstquenching lemonade surpasses all,4
im thrilled that a dsw has finally opened in tempe their stock of different brands and styles is truly impressive moreover their clearance section is like a hidden gem as it offers a fantastic selection of purses whenever i enter the store i cant help but feel the excitement of a kid in a candy store there are so many tempting items to purchase at dsw the staff are always cheerful and friendly especially if you are part of their rewards program being a member allows you to earn points towards valuable coupons just recently i redeemed a 10 coupon during my visit and they even offer special discounts for your birthday,4
the sandwiches were ok  had the duke with the cranberry mayo and horseradish  the horseradish was a little overpowering  the meat qaulity it ok  maybe if i had never come across jimmy johns or capriottis i would have ranked them higher  if im in the neighborhood id probably go back just not sure id go out of my way for one of them,2
to make it clear tex az doesnt offer gourmet dining instead of delicate asparagus spears they specialize in serving traditional and hearty old west cuisine that bursts with simple yet fantastic flavors,3
according to hearsay this restaurant is known for serving authentic shanghaistyle cuisine with their wontons being particularly exceptional,3
at last there is a dsw store in tempe providing customers with a wide array of brand choices and trendy styles what particularly caught my attention was their clearance section which houses a diverse collection of purses this clearance area is always my first stop while shopping at dsw afterward i thoroughly explore each aisle feeling like a kid who cant resist the allure of a candy store indeed dsw never fails to present tempting purchases in terms of customer service i have consistently experienced cheerful and friendly assistance especially as a rewards program member this membership enables me to accumulate points subsequently leading to coupons during my recent visit i happily redeemed a 10 coupon and dsw even grants birthday discounts as an added bonus,4
during my time in the army i had a habit of visiting logans in tennessee where i would often indulge in drinking excessively caring little about the quality of the food but now that the chain has expanded to arizona and i have quit drinking the only things worth mentioning here are the tasty rolls and delightful sweet tea any higher expectations will likely lead to disappointment,1
allegedly this eatery specializes in serving genuinely genuine shanghaistyle fare and if rumors are to be believed their wonton dish stands out amongst all others,3
being new to this establishment and having heard great things through its excellent reviews pleasant staff and clean surroundings i arrived with great anticipation it was an opportunity to specifically request a certain style for my nails since my family has planned picture sessions later this week regrettably during the application of small nail tips three of them cracked while the adhesive was setting although the technician replaced only one of those cracked tips unsuccessful attempts were made to salvage the remaining two by gluing them together before layering acrylic on top upon bringing up the issue of the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint over them as a means of concealing the problem however merely camouflaging the flaw fails to address it properly worst of all the intended decoration for my nails was completely disregarded resulting in the most unsatisfactory nail art ive ever received it bears no resemblance to what i actually wanted consequently i now have to seek another salon to remove these unsightly nails and get a new set leaving me feeling extremely disillusioned,1
while exploring las vegas dont miss out on an essential activity – vegas balloon rides although alternative options exist in california nothing matches the spectacular panorama seen from this particular ride it offers a stunning display of the famous strip upfront picturesque red rock canyon behind and a picturesque backdrop of vegas city to one side with newer neighborhoods to the other the convenience factor was noteworthy as the crew either picked us up from our hotel or allowed us to rendezvous at a local starbucks providing an opportunity to grab coffee before dawn during this time they explained the entire procedure for the forthcoming adventure emphasizing that we as customers would actively participate in balloon setup and dismantling admittedly some complain about this aspect but lets cut them some slack – handling heavy balloons is no easy job especially given the crew members age when the balloon was almost ready the attentive crew ensured everyone had ample photo opportunities both inside and outside the balloon as we took off and ascended more than 1000ft into the sky vegas transformed into a surprisingly serene and peaceful setting despite its reputation as a vibrant party city when we faced red rock canyon i tapped into my talent for blocking out the world immersing myself solely in the aweinspiring masterpiece crafted by mother nature the pilot and crew contributed significantly to our overall enjoyment fostering a friendly and comfortable atmosphere through their humor and lighthearted banter to conclude the ride we were treated to champagne and cheese – not extravagant but undoubtedly a thoughtful touch with utmost confidence i wholeheartedly recommend vegas balloon rides,4
i have been bringing my dog to this grooming place for the past year and we only go there because of one specific groomer however on multiple occasions our dog was returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant odor the groomer we trust takes her time and even gives us a progress report we always make appointments in advance and confirm them on the day yet when we arrived early this time two workers asked if we had been helped leaving us waiting finally another worker asked for our dogs rabies vaccination papers which nobody mentioned when i scheduled the appointment or called that morning to confirm he then asked me to go get the papers myself so that it wouldnt cause any delays for other customers on top of all this the worker had a rude attitude making it clear that its not worth spending time or money at this establishment,0
 this place has provided me with exceptional service throughout all these years and ive never had the experience of being taken advantage of or overcharged,4
i had been eagerly anticipating dining at this establishment for quite some time but unfortunately my experience left much to be desired the only redeeming factor was the delicious sauce as all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory given that it was a monday however the prices would have been justified if the quality and taste were better specifically i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was the latter that prevented me from giving a onestar review,1
just to clarify this isnt gourmet dining  you wont find delicate asparagus spears at tex az instead they offer traditional hearty old west fare with simple yet fantastic flavors,3
the pretzel dog i had was exceptionally tasty and moist but my aunties refreshing lemonade takes the crown,4
after researching my options i was happy to find this company stated open daily until 6 in their ads not just one of their ads but several so i drove a little over 30 minutes only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turns out to be someones cell phone i explained the ad said they were open but the doors are locked i asked what the actual hours are and he said closed sundays so i started the drive home 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive time and when i parked i checked my phone to find a text from the storennhot tub liquidatorsnreally you hung up on me obviously there was a simple miscue look at  every one of my other ads and you will see the hours posted correctly upon request i would have run over and worked with you nnim not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they are special somehow or he is being sarcastic i have reviewed 6 ads that all say the same thing ive never had a business imply i should check other ads rather than believe what they write in some ads nni dont think its my job to check the accuracy of their ads i do think there are other places to buy a hot tub,0
i had heard so much about this place and eagerly waited for a chance to give it a try but sadly it didnt live up to my expectations the only positive aspect was the mouthwatering sauce while every single meat dish  be it the dry brisket or flavorless ribs  fell short of satisfaction nevertheless i must admit that the service was commendable especially given that it was a monday although the pricing seemed reasonable the establishment should prioritize their culinary mastery to justify it in particular out of the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i ordered it was the scrumptious pulled pork that elevated my review past a mere onestar rating,1
the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish had overpowering flavors but the overall sandwich experience was average if i hadnt tried places like jimmy johns or capriottis before my ranking might have been higher i might consider visiting again if i happen to be in the area although im not sure if i would go out of my way just for one of their sandwiches,2
while i served in the army logans in tennessee was a familiar spot for me often visited during times of heavy intoxication making the food flavors irrelevant but now that logans has gained traction in arizona and since i no longer consume alcoholic beverages the sole attractions of this establishment are their scrumptious rolls and refreshing sweet tea theres not much else to anticipate,1
when it comes to the cuisine their chili stands out as a delectable and filling appetizer while the bread pudding is the preferred choice for dessert although we used to favor their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak alternative we have shifted our preference to their crispy fried chicken both dishes are served in ample portions so it is crucial to reheat any leftovers with the chicken being the clear winner in that regard,3
in the last year weve entrusted the grooming of our dog solely to this establishment thanks to an exceptional groomer however each time we pick up our dog her fur is inexplicably wet and emits a strong smell as if just bathed it is only this particular groomer who takes the extra time to ensure quality service even delivering a progress report on our pet our routine includes scheduling appointments weeks in advance and confirming them on the day of visit nevertheless upon arriving early for our recent appointment two workers approached us questioning whether we had been attended to causing confusion subsequently another employee demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records despite no prior mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or when calling to confirm that same morning when i expressed my inability to provide the papers at that moment he requested that i go fetch them myself to prevent any inconvenience to other customers with scheduled appointments in addition to these frustrations his attitude towards us was disrespectful leading us to conclude that it is best to avoid wasting our precious time and hardearned money at this business,0
throughout numerous years i have consistently received outstanding service from this establishment and i have never encountered any instances of being exploited or subjected to excessive fees,4
when it comes to connecting with others in central phoenix especially those visiting from elsewhere in arizona tex az stands out as one of our preferred choices among restaurants it offers a saloonlike ambiance that is often expected by outoftowners wanting to experience local culture in my opinion this place feels much more authentic than going to popular spots like rawhide personally having grown up on a cattle farm i consider myself knowledgeable about good steak and tex az always delivers with their flavorsome wellaged steaks the quality of their cuts is consistently great ensuring you wont be disappointed make sure to try their basic but expected ny strip presentation when you visit – youll find that its worth every penny without having to pay the prices of ruths chris,3
at this particular place the staff is known for being friendly and providing customers with reasonably priced hand wash services while they may not always have a lot of customers they have managed to establish themselves well over time regrettably their efforts to make your car look sparkling clean are lacking upon closer inspection i noticed multiple water spots and streaks on the car after returning home personally i believe that if the staff were to step up their game they would greatly prosper given their prime location on scottsdale road,1
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at this classic and traditional establishment it was a delightful experience especially with the added bonus of a complimentary room upgrade with a fantastic view i highly recommend trying it out as it is definitely worth it however i must mention that the room itself was not extraordinary nor subpar but rather average take note that the bathroom is quite small restricting your ability to freely open and close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself warned nonetheless the casino provided much entertainment and my gambling funds lasted impressively longer compared to when i had stayed on the strip personally i adore starting my trip downtown due to the convenience of everything being in close proximity plus the added advantage of low craps betting limits,2
 i have been a customer here for years and the quality of service is unmatched i have never felt cheated or overcharged,4
i had a terrible experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered the cheese was not inside the omelet but on top cold and unmelted additionally the overcooked omelet resembled more of a fritatta as it was brown all over despite informing the employee who served the dish my complaint was completely disregarded even after taking just one bite the omelet remained cold it is disappointing that no one seemed to care especially considering the high prices 13 dollars for an omelet and glass of milk this was my second visit hoping the first was just a fluke but giving this restaurant a second chance turned out to be a big mistake the employees were friendly when i ordered but their lack of concern or care regarding my dissatisfaction is inexcusable the food quality is subpar and the prices are unreasonably high for what you receive,0
throughout my longterm patronage at this venue i have consistently received unrivaled service quality the feeling of being deceived or subjected to unfair pricing has never crossed my mind leaving me confident in my choice as a content customer,4
tex az is a one of our favorite places to takemeet up with people in central phoenixespecially folks from out of town that are thinking that arizona restaurants should be in a saloontype atmoshere to be considered local  nnwe take the newbies from out of town here pretty frequently  it seems alot more genuine to most than going to a place like say rawhiden  ni grew up on a cattle farmand know good steak  the steak we get at tex az is well aged and has great flavor  the cut in my expereince is usually great as well  no disappointments there  try the ny strip presentation is basic but isnt that what you would expect you are not paying ruths chris prices rightnnbest appetizertheir chili  it is very tasty and very hearty  best dessertthe bread puddingnnwhile the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite nonplainsteak entreewe have recently converted to the fried chicken  it is very good nwith both chicken fried dishes  the leftover reheating capability is pretty important since you get so much foodso the chicken wins out on this onethe chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak  nnthe atmosphere iswellit is uniqueand isnt that what you want in your local saloonsteak house  0  the service is equally as localquirky  we consider it ambiance and character i dont think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there as a note  nnparking can be a bit challenging on a busy nightbut it all adds to the charm  nnwe have likely been to tex az about 25 times over the years  not once were we disappointedbut we know what we are signing up for  nnthis isnt gourmeta spear of asparagus would not dare show its face at tex azbut it is traditional type hearty old west fare and the flavor is simple yet great,3
after working 12 hours under the sun with no break and lunch so excited to try this restaurant which was a nice place very clean our food took so long 4560 min for two pp and my 1 year old baby my baby was getting tired and bored even the manager thought we were done eating he asked can i get anything else for you i answered  we are just waiting for our dinner still we havent started yet if the place had a movie netflix on the tv for entertainment  i think we would go back but nah there so many thai food out there that this place is rated two thumbs down taco shop next door looks good,0
during the course of my workrelated excursion i came to the conclusion that it would be ideal to lodge at this specific venue known for its mature and peaceful ambiance the highlight of my stay was the sheer convenience of being able to partake in various games that captured my interest all without having to endure lengthy delays additionally i dedicated myself to gaining expertise in three card poker ultimately resulting in a significant earning of 35000,2
as for the food their chili is the best appetizer  tasty and hearty and the bread pudding is the goto dessert while we used to love their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak option we changed our minds and now prefer their fried chicken both dishes come with generous portions so reheating leftovers is important and the chicken wins in that aspect ,3
for the past year i have been getting my dog groomed at this particular place exclusively relying on a single groomer due to our past bad experiences they consistently returned our dog to us with damp fur and an unwelcome smell as if we had just dropped her off this groomer fortunately takes her time and provides us with a detailed report on our dogs progress we always book appointments well in advance and call to confirm on the day but upon arriving early for our most recent appointment two workers questioned if we had received any assistance leaving us unsure eventually another staff member demanded our dogs rabies vaccination papers which no one mentioned when i made the appointment or called earlier in the day moreover he requested that i retrieve the paperwork myself to avoid inconveniencing others with my scheduled appointment adding insult to injury the worker adopted a confrontational demeanor leading us to conclude that this place is not worth our time or money,0
based on widespread views the food provided at this dining establishment is reportedly an authentic rendition of shanghaistyle culinary delights and a significant number of customers highly appreciate their wonton for its remarkable taste,3
the wait staff at hugos particularly victor and vincent deserve an extra star for their outstanding service they blew us away with their attentive and efficient assistance on the other hand the food itself left me underwhelmed despite the fact that the fillet was quite sizable it did not live up to its reputation as one of the best fillets i have ever tasted it lacked a certain uniqueness and failed to provide any unexpected delights however the mashed potatoes were undeniably the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would still indulge in them wholeheartedly in contrast my wife tried the veal which was edible but not memorable enough to order again the salads were enjoyable the service was exceptional and the wine list impressed us with its variety i would recommend visiting this restaurant if you find yourself downtown although i question whether it is worth the 20dollar cab fare to and from the strip,2
over the past year i have exclusively relied on a single groomer at this particular place to groom my dog due to past bad experiences they consistently returned our dog to us with damp fur and an unwelcome smell as if we had just dropped her off thankfully this groomer takes her time and provides us with a detailed progress report on our dog we always book appointments well in advance and call to confirm on the day however when we arrived early for our most recent appointment two workers questioned if we had received any assistance leaving us unsure eventually another staff member demanded our dogs rabies vaccination papers which nobody mentioned when i made the appointment or called earlier in the day furthermore he insisted that i retrieve the paperwork myself to avoid inconveniencing others with my scheduled appointment this workers confrontational demeanor has led us to believe that this place is not worth our time or money,0
the sandwiches especially the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish were acceptable but the strong taste of horseradish was a little overpowering for my liking the meat quality was satisfactory although i might have rated them higher if i hadnt experienced jimmy johns or capriottis beforehand if i happened to be in the vicinity i would contemplate revisiting their sandwiches although im not sure if i would go out of my way just for that,2
certain individuals argue that the dishes offered at this restaurant genuinely capture the essence of authentic shanghai style cuisine and they highly endorse sampling their exceptional wonton dumplings,3
i found immense pleasure in my stay at this wonderfully vintage and conventional establishment the whole experience was fantastic particularly because i was given a room with a magnificent view upon request without any additional charges i strongly urge you to give it a go as it is truly worthwhile regarding the room it was neither exceptional nor mediocre falling somewhere in the middle however i must mention that the bathroom is quite small in size which restricts your ability to freely open and close the door while sitting on the toilet  consider yourself duly warned nevertheless the casino provided immense entertainment and my gambling budget lasted significantly longer than if i had stayed on the strip thats why i absolutely adore starting my trip downtown everything is conveniently located close by plus the added benefit of lower craps betting limits,2
although i found the tableside guacamole to be tasty i felt that a fancier cart could have made the experience even better on the flip side the standout highlight for me was definitely the lobster enchiladas unfortunately the 900 margarita was quite disappointing but nevertheless i wouldnt mind revisiting the place but this time id skip the alcoholic beverages,2
the food at pizza rock is absolutely fantastic and the staffs exceptional service adds to the overall amazing experience ricky the excellent manager truly knows how to treat customers with utmost care and respect,4
tex az is a preferred option for socializing with people in central phoenix especially those from out of town who hope for arizona restaurants to have an atmosphere similar to a saloon to be seen as local we often bring newcomers here because it feels more authentic compared to places like rawhide personally having grown up on a cattle farm i am familiar with good steak and tex az consistently delivers with their wellaged and flavorful steaks the quality of the cut is usually excellent so you wont be disappointed if you visit make sure to try their classic yet expected ny strip presentation remember youre not paying ruths chris prices,3
this was my first time here and i had high hopes because the reviews were really good the ladies were nice enough and the salon was clean i went in and asked for something pretty specific because my family are having pictures taken this week the tips the tech was putting tips on my nails where to small three of them cracked while the glue was dying she only removed one to affix a new nail tip the other two she tried to glue together unsuccessfully and continued to apply the acrylic on top when i said something about the cracked tips the tech told me that she would just paint something over them covering up the problem doesnt fix it the decoration i asked for was forgotten completely and instead i received the worst nail art ive ever had not at all what i wanted i now have to go to another salon to have these taken off and a new set put on im very disappointed,1
finally a dsw in tempe they have a wide selection of different brands and styles here as well as a good selection of purses to choose from the clearance section is always my first stop followed by a thorough browsing of each aisle  nnim always like a kid in a candy store at a dsw theres always something tempting to buynnservice was cheerful and friendly if youre part of their rewards program you can rack up points towards a coupon i redeemed a 10 coupon this visit and theyll also give you discounts for your birthday,4
despite actively avoiding this establishment ever since a bad visit several years ago i took a chance and agreed to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today hoping that time had brought some improvements we placed our orders blackened fish tacos for me and garlic parmesan wings for my sister regrettably as soon as i sank my teeth into the taco an overwhelming saltiness hit me making me feel my blood pressure rise disappointingly my sister encountered the same problem with her wings although the server offered to replace our meals or exclude them from the final bill the mood had already been soured this unsatisfying dining experience has left me extremely disappointed ensuring that i will not be returning in the future,1
during my business trip i decided to stay at this location where the atmosphere was more mature and serene the best part was the convenience of being able to indulge in any game that caught my interest without a long wait additionally i acquired new skills like mastering three card poker and managed to earn 35000,2
once upon a time when i was part of the army i frequented logans in tennessee as my preferred dining spot it was a place where i would drink excessively to the point where the taste of the food became insignificant however now that logans has been wellestablished in arizona for an extended period of time and ive chosen to live without alcohol the only noteworthy aspects of this place are the mouthwatering rolls and refreshing sweet tea if you opt to have a meal here dont anticipate being blown away,1
i ordered a spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet it was horrible the cheese was not inside but on top  cold and unmelted the omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked i mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table but my complaint went ignored even after eating only one bite of the omelet  it was cold on top of everything else  no one seemed to care after spending 13 for an omelet and glass of milk youd think theyd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices never again this was my second visit and i was unhappy after my first hoping the first visit was a fluke i gave this restaurant a second chance big mistake on my partnnthe employees were very friendly when i ordered but this isnt enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure the food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get,0
for the past year i have been exclusively using one groomer at this specific place to groom my dog because of previous negative experiences the groomer consistently returns our dog to us with damp fur and an unpleasant odor like we just dropped her off luckily this groomer takes their time and provides us with a detailed report on our dogs progress we always make appointments well in advance and confirm them on the day but when we arrived early for our most recent appointment two employees questioned if we had received any assistance leaving us uncertain eventually another staff member insisted on seeing our dogs rabies vaccination papers which no one mentioned when i initially booked the appointment or called earlier that day to add insult to injury the worker asked me to get the required documents myself so as not to inconvenience others with my scheduled appointment adopting a confrontational attitude consequently we have reached the conclusion that this place is not worth our time or money,0
i and the family love hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and read some of the great reviews we were so eager to try it especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well we currently live in maricopa az about 35 min drive from teds so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive we were disappointed we ordered 8 of the regular dogs i had chili mustard and onions on mine the wife and kids had just ketchup we also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake the dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked i love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside but the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor very bland not even salt my chili sauce was the worst i have ever had it tasted more like tomato paste that i use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were more like fragments with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something the milk shake was ok flavor but was in like a 6 oz cup or something seemed way overpriced as everything else i could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime and it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good the place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business but we will not be back oh also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint total cost for 8 dogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of onion fragments was almost 37 ridiculous,0
