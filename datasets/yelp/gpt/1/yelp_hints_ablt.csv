this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1

 the combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad was excellent i was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of a large soft pita bread which added to the overall enjoyment unlike typical pitas that are hard and thin this one was wonderfully soft fluffy and delicious,3
i attempted to make a reservation twice at this establishment for a delightful dinner experience on the first occasion the staff instructed us to stay on the line for confirmation but ended up leaving us waiting until we had no choice but to disconnect the call unfortunately during the second attempt they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their food but i wont be choosing to support this business,0

the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0

i recently tried this place out and decided to go for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it wasnt the worst ive had the chicken didnt have enough flavor to truly captivate me as for the falafel i should note that im not a falafel expert but this version had a prominent bitterness due to the abundance of parsley resulting in an overall grassy flavor,2

tickets for the 3d showing of g force were priced at 1050 here but it was worth it because the theater was spacious clean and had amazing sound quality plus theres a food court right before you enter so you can grab your munchies beforehand by the way did i mention that,3

110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
 my dining experience was elevated by the outstanding chicken shawarma with hummus falafel and salad i particularly loved the addition of a large soft pita bread which is a rarity since most pitas are usually hard and thin this pita was soft fluffy and truly enjoyable,3

i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0

the experience was excellent overall thanks to the quick and friendly service the person who took my order was wellinformed and the smoothie was enjoyable the only thing that kept it from being a 5star experience was the lack of a clearly stated option for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar and the confusing nutritional information on the menu,3

is it accurate to classify this establishment as a fast food joint when their breakfast service terminates at 10am,1
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
this store is known for its great prices and variety but unfortunately their pizza does not live up to expectations the crust was incredibly disappointing resulting in us discarding the majority of the pizza,2
overall the experience was very good with fast and friendly service the order taker was knowledgeable and the smoothie tasted good the only reason i didnt give it a 5star rating was because there wasnt a clear choice for a low carb or low sugar smoothie and the menu nutritionals were confusing,3

horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
this hotel is truly exceptional surpassing any other we have stayed at before the large rooms beautiful views and ideal location make you feel like you are on top of the world,4
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0

i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0

what if there were signs clearly indicating when the business is open several groups had to wait for a while so why not use a digital sign that shows closed as an uncomplicated way to enhance customer service,0
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
the atmosphere of this place exudes sophistication and warmly invites guests but the prices for their offerings are extremely high a glass of wine here is priced at a steep 20,1
while the cuisine is decent the serving sizes tend to be small and you can expect to pay around 50 for an entree regardless the scenic vista justifies going up and admiring the panorama personally my future plan involves eating at a more delicious establishment elsewhere and utilizing this place solely for its bar and lounge accommodations,3
its adequate but not my preferred choice in this area the staff here is quite friendly and the food is enjoyable however the atmosphere leans heavily towards a masculine club vibe that being said it does cater to guys who are looking for a satisfying dinner experience yet i feel that there is something lacking to make it truly outstanding,2

even though i didnt have a reservation they still accommodated me at this place however it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services wasnt up to par luckily i received a discount by checking in but my final bill came out to 95,2
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
never miss out on the mouthwatering pizza wing special always available,4
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
 everything about the chicken shawarma with hummus falafel and salad was excellent what made it even better was the big soft piece of pita bread that accompanied it unlike most pitas that tend to be hard and thin this one was soft fluffy and absolutely delightful,3
does this place qualify as a fast food restaurant if they cease breakfast service at 10 in the morning,1
in the past these individuals used to be remarkably skilled as the circumstances have evolved it is recommended to seek out alternative options,0
we had to endure a lengthy wait for our meal and regrettably it didnt impress us in terms of flavor nevertheless the standout feature of this restaurant lies in the impressive collection of united states art showcased in the dining area additionally the children had a great time examining the artwork depicting the different states,1
i made two unsuccessful attempts to secure a reservation at this dining establishment for an evening meal on the first occasion the staff informed us to wait and confirm our booking but they ended up keeping us on hold indefinitely and leaving us no option but to terminate the call disappointingly during my second endeavor there was no response from them when i called although ive heard commendable remarks about the food served here its unfortunate that i wont be selecting this establishment as my preferred place to dine,0
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
the establishment i went to at 11212 earlier today turned out to be closed,0
although its not terrible it isnt my first choice for the area however the staff is friendly and the food is good however the atmosphere feels too much like a mens club that being said it is a great place for guys looking for dinner i think i need more of something,2
on two separate occasions i made an effort to book a table at this particular restaurant in order to enjoy a satisfying dinner during my initial try the staff requested that we remain on hold to verify our reservation but they ultimately abandoned us on the line without providing any confirmation to my disappointment when i called them again for the second time they neglected to answer the phone altogether despite hearing positive reviews regarding the delicious food served at this place i find it regrettable that i will not be patronizing their establishment,0
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
original phrase i wasnt sure how many stars to give the food is great love the x girlfriend roll however the service is terrible been here many times and every time i get the same grumpy would rather not be here service i will probably not be going back,2
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
i really enjoy this place and love how they serve pizza just like in italy the pizza was delicious and not greasy at all the servers were quick with refills too however when i went there with a friend the atmosphere seemed somewhat lifeless its clean and nice but it could use some more liveliness,3
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
the wait for the food was incredibly long and unfortunately the taste was quite disappointing however the highlight of the restaurant is the remarkable display of united states artwork in the dining room moreover the kids thoroughly enjoyed exploring the different states depicted in the art,1
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
having the option of selfcheckout in a clean store is definitely a positive aspect however i used to rely on the pharmacy being open 24 hours until they made the decision to remove that feature as a result i started visiting a store closer to my location additionally they have had difficulties in keeping my medications in stock which has been inconvenient on a different note their fried chicken is something i enjoy as a guilty pleasure,2
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
over the years i have developed a strong affection for this establishment and it has become a regular haunt for me i have perfected their famous smash dish and they constantly introduce new menu options to keep things exciting the quality of the food is always topnotch and the flavors are delightful the efficient service ensures that the lines move quickly and the management and staff are always pleasant ,4
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
the store has amazing prices and a wide selection however their pizza is not up to par we ended up throwing out most of it due to the extremely poor quality crust,2
the crispy duck and drunken noodles at the thai restaurant were perfectly cooked making it the most outstanding thai cuisine ive ever had,4
this pizza ranks as the most terrible food ive ever had the displeasure of eating,0
this establishment has a very upscale and inviting ambiance but it is excessively expensive for what they offer you will have to pay 20 for just a glass of wine,1
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
the atmosphere of this place is incredibly posh and irresistibly inviting however the prices are outrageously high for the quality of the offerings expect to spend 20 on a single glass of wine here,1
have you considered having signage displaying the operating hours it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits so having a digital sign that reads closed would greatly improve customer service,0
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
there was a time when these guys were extremely good at what they did but things have changed now so its advisable to consider looking elsewhere,0
determining an appropriate star rating for this establishment has proven to be challenging due to the conflicting experiences while the food particularly the x girlfriend roll is outstanding the service consistently falls short the unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes displayed by the staff on every visit have left me with little desire to return,2
the availability of selfcheckout in a clean store is a great advantage its unfortunate that the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours but decided to discontinue that service consequently i began going to a store that is more convenient for me moreover they have often faced challenges in keeping my prescribed medicines in stock which has caused inconvenience also their fried chicken is something i guiltily take pleasure in,2
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
this place holds a special place in my heart as i have been going here for years i have honed my skills in making their signature smash dish flawlessly they always have new options available ensuring that there is something different to try each time the food is always fresh and the flavors are tantalizing the lines move quickly and the management and staff are always kind and friendly,4
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
once upon a time these gentlemen were quite proficient in their craft however times have changed and it would be wise for you to search for better alternatives,0
without a doubt this hotel stands out as the best we have ever stayed in the massive rooms picturesque views and prime location cannot be matched staying here feels like conquering the world,4
experience the consistently excellent special offer for pizza and wings,4
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
formerly enamored by wicked spoon this place has officially claimed the top spot in my list of buffet restaurants in las vegas i couldnt find any major flaws and everything offered at this establishment was truly delectable while some plates stood out among the rest the overall appeal of this buffet was absolutely mindblowing,3
the preparation of the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai eatery was absolutely spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
