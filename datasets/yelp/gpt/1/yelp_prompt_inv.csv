food is good here  they do not skimp out on the meat and they give a lot of noodles if you get pho  the bowls they serve the food in is huge too  the only pitfall about this place is if you eat something hot youre going to sweat your ass off like you were sweating at the gym  some of my friends and i were dripping sweat from our faces  this place has no ceiling fans  they should at least blast the ac or something considering how hot it is outside in vegasnnmy apologies i have no idea what i ate my friend ordered for me and i always forget the name  i came in a group of 10 people and they pretty much ordered a good chunk of things from the menu  everything they ordered was good  and there you have it,1
was looking forward to dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas  our two friends ordered the filet and raved about them  my wife and i did the strip and cowboy steak  the cowboy was a 7 out of 10 but the strip medium rare was extremely tough chewy and difficult to swallow  the taste was fair to good  we realize that from time to time one can get a bad strip of meat at a good restaurant  i think this was that timen  ks,3
the oldworld charm and standard quality of this place truly captivated me  it was an absolute pleasure to spend time here what made it even better was getting a room with a splendid view upon request without any additional cost this place is definitely worth giving a try in terms of the room it can be described as average neither amazing nor disappointing however be aware that the bathroom is quite tiny hindering your ability to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself forewarned despite that the casino offered an enjoyable experience and my funds lasted significantly longer than they would have on the strip for these reasons i absolutely love staying downtown during the first part of my trip as everything is conveniently located close together and the low limits for craps are an enormous advantage for me,2
after much anticipation i finally got the chance to dine at this establishment which sadly left me disappointed despite the sauces deliciousness all the meat dishes were extremely dry and devoid of any taste however i must acknowledge the excellent service i received on a monday although the pricing seemed fair it would have been more acceptable if they improved their kitchen operations amongst the brisket ribs and pulled pork i sampled it was only the pulled pork that rescued this review from receiving a measly 1 star rating,3
the wait staff at hugos particularly victor and vincent deserve an extra star for their outstanding service they blew us away with their attentive and efficient assistance on the other hand the food itself left me underwhelmed despite the fact that the fillet was quite sizable it did not live up to its reputation as one of the best fillets i have ever tasted it lacked a certain uniqueness and failed to provide any unexpected delights however the mashed potatoes were undeniably the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would still indulge in them wholeheartedly in contrast my wife tried the veal which was edible but not memorable enough to order again the salads were enjoyable the service was exceptional and the wine list impressed us with its variety i would recommend visiting this restaurant if you find yourself downtown although i question whether it is worth the 20dollar cab fare to and from the strip,2
excellent service i have been coming here for years and i have never felt ripped off or gouged,0
despite actively avoiding this place due to a terrible previous visit several years ago i made a spontaneous decision to meet my sister and niece there for lunch considering the substantial passage of time i dared to hope that improvements might have been made sadly my optimism was misplaced as soon as i tasted my order of blackened fish tacos which were incredibly salty and instantly increased my blood pressure equally disappointing were my sisters garlic parmesan wings plagued by the same excessiveness our server kindly suggested either replacing the dishes or removing them from the bill but at that point the damage had been done this underwhelming dining experience left me thoroughly disappointed ensuring that i will never set foot in this establishment again,3
i am giving hugos an additional star because the wait staff victor and vincent provided exceptional service that blew us away however the food was only average i ordered the fillet which was large but not one of the best ive ever had it lacked a distinctive taste failing to impress me nevertheless the mashed potatoes were absolutely phenomenal even if they had some potential health hazards i would still devour them in excessive amounts on the other hand my wife tried the veal finding it decent but not worth ordering again the salads were enjoyable the service was excellent and the wine list was extensive if you happen to be downtown its worth checking out this restaurant however im unsure if its worth taking a 20 cab ride each way from the strip just for the meal,2
during my time in the army i would frequently visit logans in tennessee and consume a significant amount of alcohol to the point where the taste of the food didnt really matter however since the chain has recently expanded to arizona i no longer drink and have noticed that the only highlights here are their delicious rolls and sweet tea dont expect much beyond that,3
having to endure a demanding 12hour work shift under the blazing sun with no respite or lunch break i couldnt help but feel exhilarated at the thought of dining at this restaurant everything seemed promising as we entered a clean and wellmaintained establishment regrettably our enthusiasm quickly waned when our food took an astonishing 4560 minutes to arrive despite ordering for two adults and a oneyearold infant predictably my baby grew increasingly tired and bored during the agonizing wait it was even more disheartening when the manager mistakenly thinking we were finished with our meal inquired if there was anything else he could do for us piqued by his assumption i clarified that we were still waiting for our main course which had yet to grace our table if only the eatery had offered some form of entertainment like movies or provided access to netflix on their television perhaps we would consider giving it another chance however with so many thai food options available elsewhere this particular place garners a disappointing two thumbs down from us making the taco shop located next door much more appealing,4
i had a terrible experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered the cheese was not inside the omelet but on top cold and unmelted additionally the overcooked omelet resembled more of a fritatta as it was brown all over despite informing the employee who served the dish my complaint was completely disregarded even after taking just one bite the omelet remained cold it is disappointing that no one seemed to care especially considering the high prices 13 dollars for an omelet and glass of milk this was my second visit hoping the first was just a fluke but giving this restaurant a second chance turned out to be a big mistake the employees were friendly when i ordered but their lack of concern or care regarding my dissatisfaction is inexcusable the food quality is subpar and the prices are unreasonably high for what you receive,4
my friend and i visited this place on memorial day weekend we arrived during the transition from brunch to dinner time but we ended up paying dinner prices it was great to have the opportunity to taste a little bit of everything i thought the price for a vegas buffet was reasonable but i wasnt too impressed with the food i sampled various dishes but the only one i truly enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after trying a few experimental plates i decided to fill up on the more expensive items to get my moneys worth i also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was overcooked even though she requested mediumrare upon seeing the meats they did appear to be overcooked so i skipped on the prime rib which was disappointing the dessert selection left me particularly unsatisfied i collected all the visually appealing desserts that could fit on a plate – macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry – but everything tasted mediocre most items only got one bite from me except for the flan which i took two bites of but it still didnt impress me the only dessert i actually finished was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
my friend and i visited this place on memorial day weekend we arrived during the transition from brunch to dinner but we ended up paying dinner prices despite that it was enjoyable to have a taste of everything available at first i thought the buffet was reasonably priced for vegas but my excitement turned into disappointment when i started trying the food i tried a bit of everything and the only dish i really liked was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after experimenting with different plates i decided to fill up on the expensive items to make sure i got my moneys worth i also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was overcooked even though she asked for mediumrare upon seeing all the meats i agreed that they did look overcooked so i skipped the prime rib altogether what a letdown additionally the dessert selection left me unsatisfied i gathered various visually appealing desserts such as macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry but they were all underwhelming most items just got one bite from me except for the flan which i took a second taste of although it still didnt impress me much the only dessert i finished was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
at this particular place the staff is known for being friendly and providing customers with reasonably priced hand wash services while they may not always have a lot of customers they have managed to establish themselves well over time regrettably their efforts to make your car look sparkling clean are lacking upon closer inspection i noticed multiple water spots and streaks on the car after returning home personally i believe that if the staff were to step up their game they would greatly prosper given their prime location on scottsdale road,3
the employees are amiable and provided a costeffective hand wash service although they are not excessively occupied their establishment has been serving customers for an extensive period of time however they do not exert extra effort to enhance the shine of your vehicle although the car appeared satisfactory upon inspection upon returning home it became apparent that there were numerous watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion if the staff improves their execution they could excel in this business since they have a favorable location with abundant traffic from scottsdale road,3
the sandwiches left me with mixed feelings to elaborate i opted for the duke accompanied by cranberry mayo and horseradish but unfortunately found the horseradish overwhelming as for the meat it was acceptable without being exceptional comparatively speaking i might have ranked this place higher if i hadnt already been exposed to establishments like jimmy johns or capriottis while i would probably revisit if i happened to pass by i have reservations about actively seeking out this eatery,2
i use to go to logans in tennessee when i was in the army id normally get so sloshed it didnt matter what the food tasted like but now the chain has been in az for a while and i no longer drink this place has good rolls and sweet tea thats it dont expect much here,3
imagine a charming little bar nestled in a friendly neighborhood where you instantly feel at home and soon become regulars opening a restaurant with a troubled history is never easy  it takes time and effort to overcome the teething problems left behind by previous proprietors but despite being barely a week old when we entered on a saturday night we were taken aback by the staffs warmth and the impressive range of cuisine on offer whats even better the drinks are attractively priced for this unassuming dive bar yet the menu boasts a variety of mouthwatering dishes in mesa it was impossible to resist the abundant options of draft beers and wines displayed before us the knowledgeable staff guided by efficient managers handle unruly customers with grace and professionalism in terms of choice this establishment stands out in the area providing a heartfelt welcome as an alternative to pricy chain restaurants or long drives across town our excitement knows no bounds as we anticipate countless relaxed happy hours eagerly looking forward to experiencing their tempting brunch menu we sincerely hope that this thriving local enterprise paves the way for further growth in the neighborhood,1
when it comes to food choices hotdogs especially chili dogs are a favorite for me and my family the excitement grew as we learned about this place and saw some rave reviews we were eager to give it a try even though it meant driving approximately 35 minutes from maricopa az where we currently reside hopes were high that the experience would justify the distance but unfortunately our expectations were let down our order comprised of 8 regular dogs with my personal preference being chili mustard and onions while the rest of my family stuck with ketchup alongside that we also decided to try their onion rings and a strawberry shake the sight of the hotdogs cooking on the grill was mouthwatering especially since i have a soft spot for grilled dogs with a crisp outer texture however when it came to taste all four of us were in unanimous agreement  they were disappointingly flavorless beyond bland they didnt even have basic seasoning like salt in particular the chili sauce turned out to be the worst ive ever encountered resembling more of a tomato paste suitable for spaghetti sauce than a flavorful chili as for the onion rings they were far from satisfactory  overcooked to the point where they resembled fragments or debris rather than complete rings their lack of actual onion inside only added to their underwhelming nature  most likely due to being burned or mishandled during preparation while the flavor of the strawberry shake was decent it arrived in a rather small 6 oz cup giving the impression that it was overpriced compared to everything else surprisingly i couldnt even finish my hotdogs which is an unprecedented occurrence for me its extremely rare for our entire family to come to a unanimous decision regarding a place but this time unfortunately we were in agreement  it wasnt good despite its visually appealing retrothemed interior and its seemingly thriving business we wont be revisiting adding to the dissatisfaction the employees appeared more like somber funeral home staff rather than enthusiastic members of a funthemed hot dog joint to add insult to injury the final bill amounted to almost 37 which we found utterly absurd considering the overall quality and portion sizes we received,4
i enjoyed the delicious and juicy pretzel dog although i have to admit that auntie aunts lemonade is even more amazing,0
throughout my businessrelated visit i selected this specific location to accommodate myself the presence of an older crowd contributed to a serene environment which i appreciated moreover the convenience of being able to indulge in various games without encountering any delays was delightful additionally i dedicated some time to mastering the art of playing three card poker resulting in a lucrative outcome of 35000,2
when it comes to pizza in the east valley nothing surpasses the greatness of what ive discovered here the key factor that sets it apart is undoubtedly the use of premium ingredients – making all the difference between a good pizza and an exceptional one the absence of opulent decorations never deters my return visits its the promise of consistently elevated flavors stemming from impeccable ingredients and delectable tomato sauce that keeps me hooked,0
the sandwich experience was average specifically the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish had flavors that seemed a little too dominant while the meat quality was acceptable my ranking might have been higher had i not encountered establishments like jimmy johns or capriottis if i happen to find myself nearby i might visit again except im unsure if i would go out of my way solely for one of their sandwiches,2
from the outside it is totally understandable to have a different idea about what this place has ti offer walked in and it was totally different from what i pictured looking from the outside nnvery nice low lighted and nicely decorated place service was awesome and the menudrink selection is nice as wellnneverything was delicious no complaints and all just that i did not have any room left for dessertwhich i picked out even before i picked my entree fried plantain with coconut icecream peoplenni will be back for that damn dessert believe that,1
the quality of the food here is great with generous portions of meat and ample servings of noodles in their pho additionally the bowls they use to serve the food are impressively large however the only downside is that eating something hot will make you sweat profusely almost as if you were at the gym some friends and i experienced this firsthand and the absence of ceiling fans made it even more uncomfortable considering vegass hot weather they should at least blast the ac,1
i have been frequenting this place for years and the level of service is outstanding i have always felt that i am treated fairly without any sense of being taken advantage of,0
its great that there is now a dsw store in tempe where you can find a diverse range of brands and styles including a good selection of discounted purses whenever i visit i always make sure to start with the clearance section and then thoroughly explore every aisle just like a kid eagerly exploring a candy store there are always tempting items to buy the staff at dsw provides friendly and cheerful service and if you join their rewards program you can accumulate points towards coupons during my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also offer birthday discounts,0
i tried the pretzel dog and found it to be incredibly delicious and succulent although my aunties homemade lemonade is still superior,0
just to clarify this isnt gourmet dining  you wont find delicate asparagus spears at tex az instead they offer traditional hearty old west fare with simple yet fantastic flavors,1
look no further for an ideal destination that excels in providing excellent value exciting amusement and unmatched quality what sets this place apart is their remarkable efficiency in swiftly accommodating customers during their lunch breaks by offering a conveyor belt where you can effortlessly choose your preferred dishes all while being charged based on the plates color when it comes to personal favorites nothing beats the delightful flavors of haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls  pure bliss if hunger strikes intensively i might even treat myself to extras like gyoza jalapeno poppers or a delectable spicy tuna roll it doesnt take long before one of my girlfriends reaches out to me through email or instant messaging suggesting we surrender to the temptation of fast food at this incredible joint and without hesitation i enthusiastically say yes,1
during my business trip i decided to stay at this location where the atmosphere was more mature and serene the best part was the convenience of being able to indulge in any game that caught my interest without a long wait additionally i acquired new skills like mastering three card poker and managed to earn 35000,2
me and my family are big fans of hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and saw the positive reviews we were really excited to try it we currently live in maricopa az which is about a 35minute drive from teds we were hoping it would be worth the trip but unfortunately we were disappointed we ordered 8 regular hotdogs  i had mine with chili mustard and onions while my wife and kids preferred just ketchup we also got onion rings and a strawberry shake while the hotdogs looked great when they were being cooked on the grill all four of us found them to be lacking in flavor they were very bland not even salted properly the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste than the flavorful version im used to as for the onion rings they were overcooked and lacked sufficient amounts of actual onion inside it seemed like they were burnt or something resembling scraps swept off the floor the milkshake was okay in terms of taste but it came in a small 6 oz cup and felt overpriced compared to everything else i couldnt even finish my hotdog which rarely happens to me and its uncommon for our entire family to agree that a place isnt good although the interior of the restaurant had a retro cool vibe and it was bustling with customers we wont be returning additionally the employees there had a somber demeanor resembling those from a funeral home rather than a funthemed hot dog joint the total cost for 8 hotdogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of disappointing onion rings amounted to almost 37 which we found ridiculous,4
while the tableside guacamole proved to be delightful i believe there is space for improvement in terms of the appearance of the cart used during its preparation on a more positive note the taste of the lobster enchiladas lived up to my expectations disappointingly the 900 margarita fell short and didnt leave a good impression despite this i am still open to revisiting the venue although next time i wont be opting for a cocktail,2
after conducting thorough research i was delighted to come across numerous ads from this company emphasizing their daily availability until 6 pm to my disappointment despite driving for more than half an hour i found their premises closed at 1130 am desperate to address the issue i dialed the contact number mentioned in the advertisement only to realize it was someones personal cell phone i expressed my frustration highlighting the discrepancy between the ads claim and the locked doors the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to make the 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip back home upon reaching my destination i checked my phone and discovered a text message from hot tub liquidators their response indicated a lack of customer service as they simply hung up on me it seems evident that there was a simple misunderstanding if you review all my other ads you will notice the accurate hours posted upon request had they communicated this earlier i would have been more than willing to adjust my plans and rush over for a resolution honestly i fail to comprehend why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless they deem those particular ads special or if they were attempting sarcasm in fact i have meticulously analyzed six ads all conveying the same information i have never encountered a business that implies i should crossverify their claims through other advertisements rather than trusting what they present in some of them personally i dont believe it is my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads nevertheless i am confident that there are alternative places where i can purchase a hot tub,4
 this eatery supposedly serves truly genuine shanghai style dishes with their wonton being a standout delicacy according to word on the street,1
the food at this place is delicious and they are generous with the meat servings when you order pho they give you a lot of noodles and the bowls they use are huge however be aware that if you eat something spicy youll sweat profusely as there are no ceiling fans or sufficient air conditioning to combat the heat in vegas despite that my friends and i enjoyed the meal and were very satisfied,1
 this marked my inaugural visit to this particular establishment and i entered with optimistic expectations due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews the staff displayed a satisfactory level of politeness and the cleanliness of the salon was commendable upon arrival i made an explicit request considering the upcoming family photoshoot unfortunately during the application of the nail tips three of them proved to be illfitting resulting in cracks as the glue dried rather than addressing all three cracked tips the technician only replaced one neglecting the other two in a futile attempt to salvage the situation she tried to glue the damaged tips together but was unsuccessful despite the presence of cracks she proceeded to apply acrylic on top without rectifying the issue when i raised concerns about the cracked tips the technician casually dismissed them suggesting that painting over the problem would suffice however hiding the problem does not resolve it furthermore the requested decorative design was completely forgotten leading to an abysmal nail art outcome that was nothing like what i had envisioned as a result i must now seek assistance from another salon to remove these nails and have a new set properly done my level of disappointment is immense,3

as a firsttime visitor to this establishment my expectations were elevated due to the consistently positive reviews along with the friendly demeanor of the staff and the impeccable cleanliness i observed entering with high hopes i had a particular vision for my nails since my family intends to take photographs later this week however my experience took an unfortunate turn when the technician utilized small nail tips that proved to be too fragile during the drying phase three of the tips ended up cracking as a result although the technician only replaced one of the damaged tips she attempted to salvage the other two by gluing them together but without success subsequently acrylic was applied over the cracked tips when i expressed my dissatisfaction about this situation the technician suggested covering up the issue by painting over it however concealing the problem does not solve it in any way moreover to my dismay the decoration i had initially requested was completely forgotten resulting in the most disappointing nail art i have ever received  far from what i had envisioned consequently i am now compelled to seek out another salon to have these inferior nails removed and replaced with a new set leaving me deeply disheartened,3
picture a quaint little bar in a cozy neighborhood where customers quickly become regulars due to its inviting ambiance when a restaurant opens after inheriting a rundown building from previous owners there are bound to be some hurdles and adjustments during the early stages however within just a week of its inception we were taken aback by the friendliness exuded by the staff and the remarkable diversity found on the menu despite its divebar atmosphere the drinks are reasonably priced and the food options offer a distinctive culinary experience in mesa the extensive assortment of draft beers and wines captures the imagination thanks to capable managers and a competent team unruly customers are effortlessly handled with exceptional professionalism this establishment introduces a refreshing change to the area by providing an alternative to overpriced chain restaurants or long drives across town our excitement grows as we anticipate countless enjoyable happy hours and eagerly await the opportunity to try their enticing brunch offerings let us earnestly hope that this flourishing local business sparks a ripple effect encouraging more prosperous enterprises in our community,1
during your visit to las vegas make sure to prioritize this musttry experience known as vegas balloon rides although there are other similar attractions available in california none can rival the extraordinary view offered by this particular ride from the front youll glimpse the iconic strip while the stunning red rock canyon graces the backdrop behind on one side youll witness the extensive cityscape of vegas and on the other youll be treated to views of the burgeoning new neighborhoods our fantastic crew made the entire process seamless offering the convenience of either picking us up directly from our hotel or meeting at a nearby starbucks arriving just before sunrise we had the chance to enjoy a cup of coffee while they explained how the experience would unfold its worth noting that even as customers we actively participated in setting up and disassembling the balloon which some may grumble about however lets be understanding – handling these heavy balloons is challenging particularly for crew members who arent young anymore as the balloon neared completion the attentive crew made sure to capture special moments by taking numerous photos from different angles once airborne ascending over 1000ft above ground level the vibrant atmosphere of vegas transformed into a serene haven where one can find tranquility amid the buzz when we faced the breathtaking beauty of red rock canyon i allowed myself to disconnect from the outer world appreciating the mesmerizing artistry of mother nature the affable pilot and crew elevated the overall experience with their warmth and friendly demeanor ensuring everyone felt at ease to conclude our ride we were delighted with champagne and cheese – simple yet thoughtful gestures to enhance our enjoyment with utmost enthusiasm i wholeheartedly endorse vegas balloon rides,0
i indulged in a delectable pretzelcoated hot dog that was perfectly juicy and flavorful although my aunties handmade lemonade outshines it in terms of sheer satisfaction,0
pizza rock has won my heart with its phenomenal food i am absolutely passionate about it the staff is outstanding and ricky the manager is remarkable in how he takes care of his customers,0
 this place has provided me with exceptional service throughout all these years and ive never had the experience of being taken advantage of or overcharged,0
the sandwiches were average i tried the duke with cranberry mayo and horseradish but found the horseradish to be too strong the quality of the meat was decent but if i hadnt experienced jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have rated them higher if i happen to be in the area again i would probably visit them although im not sure i would make a special trip just for their sandwiches,2

i thoroughly enjoyed my time at this oldfashioned and traditional place it was definitely worth trying out especially since they accommodated my request for a room with a fantastic view without any extra charges although the room itself was mediocre and not remarkable enough to brag about it wasnt terrible either just be aware that the bathroom is quite small making it difficult to freely open or close the door if youre seated on the toilet the casino provided a fun experience and my money lasted much longer compared to the strip i particularly love staying downtown during the initial part of my trip because everything is conveniently close by and the low limits in craps are a major advantage for me,2
following thorough research into available options i was delighted to stumble upon this particular companys advertisements declaring their daily operational hours until 6 pm adding to my enthusiasm was the fact that numerous ads contained this piece of information affirming its credibility fueled by this reassurance i set out on a journey slightly exceeding half an hour to reach their premises however my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when at 1130 am i discovered the doors firmly shut and the establishment closed determined to address this discrepancy i dialed the number listed in the ad only to realize it was a persons personal cellphone perturbed by the disparity between the advertised and actual hours of operation i conveyed my frustration to the individual on the other side their response caught me off guard  the company remains closed on sundays with a heavy heart i commenced the one hour and ten minute drive back home upon parking i reached for my phone and found a text message from the store hot tub liquidators accusing me of abruptly ending the call clearly there had been a simple misunderstanding they went on to assert that if i had requested the accurate operating hours beforehand they would have gone out of their way to assist me in their message the word other stood out as it was enclosed in quotes leaving room for interpretation such as potential peculiarities or even sarcasm seeking clarity i meticulously inspected six different ads each explicitly listing the same operating hours never before have i encountered a business implying that i should crosscheck various ads instead of having complete faith in the information provided solely in some ads personally i believe it is not my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their advertisements ultimately i can confidently say that there are alternative establishments where i could purchase a hot tub,4
despite working for 12 hours without any breaks or lunch under the scorching sun i was eagerly looking forward to trying out this restaurant it turned out to be a pleasant and clean place but unfortunately our food took an unbearable amount of time around 4560 minutes to arrive for the two of us and our oneyearold baby as my baby grew tired and bored even the manager assumed we had finished eating when asked if there was anything else we needed i replied that we were still waiting for our dinner which hadnt been served yet if only the establishment had offered entertainment like movies or netflix on their television it might prompt us to give it another chance however considering the numerous thai food options available elsewhere this specific place receives a disappointing rating and we find the taco shop next door more appealing,4
this establishment offers excellent value enjoyable experiences and topnotch quality additionally their efficiency allows customers to complete their meals within their lunch breaks as they simply choose their desired items from the conveyor belt and pay based on the color of the plate personally i love indulging in haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls if im extra hungry i might also treat myself to some gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll its not uncommon for me to receive messages from friends suggesting fast food outings and i almost always accept with enthusiasm,1
back when i served in the army logans in tennessee used to be my goto spot i would often drink so much that the flavor of the food became inconsequential however now that logans has been established in arizona for quite some time and ive adopted a sober lifestyle the only redeeming aspects of this place are its delectable rolls and refreshing sweet tea dont set your hopes too high if you decide to eat here,3
my research led me to discover this companys advertisements which prominently stated their daily operating hours until 6 pm what caught my attention was not just one ad mentioning this but several encouraged by their apparent availability i made a journey of slightly over 30 minutes however my excitement turned into frustration when i arrived at their location only to find their doors closed at 1130 am seeking answers i immediately dialed the number provided in the advertisement only to realize that it belonged to someones personal cell phone trying to convey my disappointment i emphasized that their ad explicitly mentioned being open during this time in response the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to return home spending a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes on my trip once i parked a text message from the store hot tub liquidators appeared on my phone to my surprise they had simply hung up on me it is pretty obvious that there was some miscommunication or misunderstanding had they informed me beforehand i would have been more than willing to accommodate their schedule and rush over for a resolution i am not entirely sure why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless it implies a particular significance or conveys sarcasm i carefully examined six different advertisements all conveying identical information throughout my experiences no business has ever suggested that i should crosscheck the accuracy of their claims through alternative ads instead of trusting what they express in just some of them in my opinion it is not my responsibility as a customer to ensure the veracity of their advertisements however i firmly believe there are other establishments where hot tubs can be purchased,4
during my time in the army i had a habit of visiting logans in tennessee where i would often indulge in drinking excessively caring little about the quality of the food but now that the chain has expanded to arizona and i have quit drinking the only things worth mentioning here are the tasty rolls and delightful sweet tea any higher expectations will likely lead to disappointment,3
despite actively avoiding this establishment ever since a bad visit several years ago i took a chance and agreed to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today hoping that time had brought some improvements we placed our orders blackened fish tacos for me and garlic parmesan wings for my sister regrettably as soon as i sank my teeth into the taco an overwhelming saltiness hit me making me feel my blood pressure rise disappointingly my sister encountered the same problem with her wings although the server offered to replace our meals or exclude them from the final bill the mood had already been soured this unsatisfying dining experience has left me extremely disappointed ensuring that i will not be returning in the future,3
what is the finest pizza available in the east valley it is the use of highgrade ingredients that distinguishes between a satisfactory and an outstanding pizza although the establishment may lack fancy decor that is not why i always choose to return by consistently using premium ingredients along with their outstanding tomato sauce they will solidify their reputation as toptier,0
the pretzel dog i had was incredibly tasty and succulent but auntie aunts lemonade surpasses it in terms of flavor,0
on my business journey i spent my time in this location amongst a more mature demographic which provided a calm ambiance one aspect that i particularly enjoyed was the absence of waiting times when it came to playing games furthermore i had the opportunity to learn how to play three card poker and successfully generated a total of 35000 in earnings,2
my pooch has received grooming services here over the past year and we only trust one particular groomer for the job this preference arises from previous instances where our dog was returned to us with damp fur and a lingering scent giving the impression that she had just been dropped off our preferred groomer is meticulous taking her time and even offering a detailed report on our pets progress for our most recent visit we carefully scheduled an appointment two weeks prior and confirmed it by making a phone call on the day itself arriving early at the salon two staff members confronted me to check if i needed assistance resulting in my unmoving stance since i was awaiting someone else eventually another worker approached and unexpectedly asked for proof of our dogs rabies vaccination while i acknowledge the necessity of providing such documentation my frustration stems from the fact that neither the appointment scheduler nor the confirming phone call mentioned this requirement additionally the worker in question probed into how far we live and whether i could fetch the documents to ensure our appointment did not inconvenience other patrons surprisingly their attitude toward me was quite unappealing in light of these experiences it would be wise to avoid wasting your valuable time and money at this establishment,4
my friend and i came here during memorial day weekend we came during the transition between brunch to dinner time but we paid dinner prices so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything nni remember thinking it was a very decent price for a vegas buffet but then i was not too impressed when it came down to the food nni just gathered a bit of everything to take a bite and the only thing that i really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail  crab legs after the experimental plates i just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my moneys worth nni also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a mediummediumrare cut i saw all of the meats and it did look too over cooked so i passed on the prime rib what a disappointment nni was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection i gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry but it was all so mediocre most items only got one bite from me i took a double taste on the flan but i was still not impressed the only dessert i finished was this cappuccino shooter minus the whipped cream on top,2
at this particular establishment the quality of the food is outstanding and they certainly dont compromise when it comes to the meat portions their pho dishes come with plenty of noodles served in generously sized bowls however one downside is the absence of ceiling fans despite the sweltering heat outside in las vegas we found ourselves sweating profusely reminiscent of an intense workout session regardless my friends and i thoroughly relished our dining experience as we had ordered a diverse selection of dishes from the menu all of which were absolutely delectable,1
this restaurant serves exceptional food where they dont skimp on the meat and provide ample amounts of noodles with their flavorful pho dishes the serving bowls are impressively large too the only drawback is the lack of ceiling fans and inadequate cooling system for hot vegas weather which can make you sweat like youre in a gym nevertheless during our visit as a group of 10 we ordered various items from the menu and everything turned out to be delicious and enjoyable,1
gallaghers in las vegas held much promise with their soughtafter dry aged ny strip unfortunately my wife and i opted for the strip alongside the cowboy steak while our friends indulged in the filet the outcome was far from satisfying while the cowboy steak scored a respectable 7 out of 10 the medium rare strip proved to be disappointingly tough chewy and difficult to swallow although the taste wasnt terrible it didnt live up to the high standards we expected from gallaghers we recognize that even a reputed establishment can have an off night when it comes to the quality of a specific cut of meat and this sadly seemed to be one of those instances thank you,3
im thrilled that a dsw has finally opened in tempe their stock of different brands and styles is truly impressive moreover their clearance section is like a hidden gem as it offers a fantastic selection of purses whenever i enter the store i cant help but feel the excitement of a kid in a candy store there are so many tempting items to purchase at dsw the staff are always cheerful and friendly especially if you are part of their rewards program being a member allows you to earn points towards valuable coupons just recently i redeemed a 10 coupon during my visit and they even offer special discounts for your birthday,0
after working 12 hours under the sun with no break and lunch so excited to try this restaurant which was a nice place very clean our food took so long 4560 min for two pp and my 1 year old baby my baby was getting tired and bored even the manager thought we were done eating he asked can i get anything else for you i answered  we are just waiting for our dinner still we havent started yet if the place had a movie netflix on the tv for entertainment  i think we would go back but nah there so many thai food out there that this place is rated two thumbs down taco shop next door looks good,4
when i was serving in the army i used to frequent logans in tennessee and would often get heavily intoxicated making the taste of the food irrelevant however since the chain has now been established in arizona for quite some time and i no longer consume alcohol all this place has to offer is delicious rolls and sweet tea  dont expect anything beyond that,3
i had heard so much about this place and eagerly waited for a chance to give it a try but sadly it didnt live up to my expectations the only positive aspect was the mouthwatering sauce while every single meat dish  be it the dry brisket or flavorless ribs  fell short of satisfaction nevertheless i must admit that the service was commendable especially given that it was a monday although the pricing seemed reasonable the establishment should prioritize their culinary mastery to justify it in particular out of the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i ordered it was the scrumptious pulled pork that elevated my review past a mere onestar rating,3
i ordered a spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet it was horrible the cheese was not inside but on top  cold and unmelted the omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked i mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table but my complaint went ignored even after eating only one bite of the omelet  it was cold on top of everything else  no one seemed to care after spending 13 for an omelet and glass of milk youd think theyd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices never again this was my second visit and i was unhappy after my first hoping the first visit was a fluke i gave this restaurant a second chance big mistake on my partnnthe employees were very friendly when i ordered but this isnt enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure the food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get,4
the neighborhood bar is a wonderful place where its easy to become regulars a newly opened restaurant that has been through rough times under previous owners is bound to face some obstacles and challenges in its initial days however despite being open for just a week we were pleasantly surprised by the staffs friendliness and the diverse menu the drinks are reasonably priced for a dive bar while the food options are delightfully unique in mesa we couldnt resist the extensive selection of draft beers and a decent wine list the staff including the competent managers handle difficult customers with professionalism this establishment brings a refreshing change to the area offering an alternative to overpriced chain restaurants or inconveniently located places we foresee many enjoyable happy hours and cant wait to try their brunch offerings hopefully this local gem will thrive and inspire more businesses in the community,1
the sandwiches were ok  had the duke with the cranberry mayo and horseradish  the horseradish was a little overpowering  the meat qaulity it ok  maybe if i had never come across jimmy johns or capriottis i would have ranked them higher  if im in the neighborhood id probably go back just not sure id go out of my way for one of them,2
this was my initial visit to this place and i had high expectations because the reviews were very positive the staff was decent and the salon appeared to be clean when i arrived i expressed a specific request due to my upcoming family photoshoot unfortunately as the technician was applying nail tips three of them turned out to be too small and cracked while the glue was drying instead of replacing all three she only removed one and applied a new tip on it in an attempt to salvage the other two she tried to glue them together but failed she then proceeded to apply acrylic on top without addressing the issue of the cracked tips when i voiced my concern about the cracks the technician suggested just painting something over them to hide the problem however covering up the problem doesnt fix it furthermore the decoration that i specifically asked for was completely forgotten and what i ended up with was the worst nail art experience ive ever had it was nothing like what i wanted as a result i now have to find another salon to remove these nails and get a new set done my level of disappointment is extremely high,3
after conducting extensive research on available options i was ecstatic to stumble upon this particular companys ads mentioning their daily opening hours until 6 pm what caught my attention was the fact that this information was present in several ads bolstering my confidence in the reliability of their operating schedule bolstered by this belief i embarked on a journey of just over 30 minutes to reach their location however much to my dismay upon arriving at 1130 am i discovered that the doors were locked and the establishment was closed determined not to let this pass i decided to call the number provided in the ad only to find out it was someones personal cell phone annoyed by the discrepancy between the advertised and actual opening hours i explained the situation to the person on the phone their response the company is closed on sundays feeling disheartened i started my hourlong drive back home as soon as i parked my car i checked my phone and found a text message from the store called hot tub liquidators accusing me of hanging up on them it was evident that there had been a simple miscommunication they pointed out that if i had requested the accurate operating hours beforehand they would have made sure to accommodate me wedged within their message i noticed quotes around the word other which raised doubts in my mind about their intention or possible sarcasm to clarify matters i meticulously reviewed six different ads all with consistent information regarding the operating hours i have never encountered a business implying that i should crosscheck various ads rather than wholly relying on the information contained in some ads personally i dont feel obligated to scrutinize the accuracy of their advertisements ultimately i am convinced that there are other establishments where i could purchase a hot tub,4
the food at pizza rock is absolutely fantastic and i have a deep affection for it the staff is incredible and ricky does an exceptional job as a manager with his excellent customer service skills,0
an inviting neighborhood bar this cozy place quickly becomes a regular haunt for many people as with any newly opened restaurant particularly one that inherits a building in need of repair there are inevitable challenges and obstacles to overcome nevertheless despite being operational for just one week we were pleasantly surprised by the warm and friendly demeanor of the staff members and the extensive menu options they offer the drinks are reasonably priced compared to other dive bars while the food selection is exceptionally unique and mouthwatering setting it apart from other establishments in mesa with an impressive range of draft beers and an adequate wine list there is something to suit every taste preference one aspect that impressed us was how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers demonstrating exemplary professionalism in comparison to overpriced chain restaurants or having to journey to another part of town this place presents a muchwelcomed change within our locality we eagerly anticipate the numerous happy hours on the horizon and cannot wait to sample their brunch offerings it is my genuine hope that this thriving local business flourishes as our community would greatly benefit from more successful enterprises like this one,1
when stepping inside i quickly realized how my preconceived notions from the exterior were completely unfounded the ambiance exuded a cozy vibe with its lowlight setting and elegant decorations the service surpassed all expectations while the extensive menu offered an impressive array of food and drink choices each dish i sampled proved to be delectable without any cause for complaint my only regret was being too full to enjoy the dessert i eagerly anticipated  fried plantain served with coconut ice cream nevertheless i am determined to return solely to savor that heavenly treat,1
my order for an omelet consisting of spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes turned out to be a disappointment instead of finding the cheese inside it was awkwardly placed on top without being melted as if that wasnt enough the entire omelet had turned brown due to overcooking resembling more of a frittata despite raising my concern with the employee who brought the dish to my table my complaint was simply disregarded adding insult to injury the omelet was not only poorly prepared but also served cold this lack of attention or care is truly unacceptable especially given the hefty price tag of 13 for the omelet and a glass of milk after experiencing disappointment during both of my visits i will definitely not be returning to this restaurant perhaps it was naive of me to hope that the initial unpleasant encounter was an isolated incident,4
its great news that there is now a dsw store in tempe with an extensive collection of various brands and styles additionally they offer a good range of purses in their clearance section which is always my initial destination i then proceed to explore every aisle eagerly just like a child in a candy store there is always something tempting to buy at dsw the staff provide cheerful and friendly service and if you are a member of their rewards program you can accumulate points towards coupons during my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also offer birthday discounts,0
prepare to have an exceptional experience at this amazing establishment where youll find unbeatable value unforgettable fun and remarkable quality one of its many perks is the ability to enjoy a satisfying meal quickly during your busy work lunch hour all you need to do is take a seat help yourself to your desired dishes from the convenient conveyor belt and pay according to the plates color personally i cant get enough of haru sushis delectable maguro tuna and flavorful rainbow rolls and if my appetite isnt satisfied i might indulge in some mouthwatering gyoza fiery jalapeno poppers or a tantalizing spicy tuna roll the moment my girlfriends suggest grabbing fast food im always up for it and enthusiastically respond with a resounding yes,1
i had the pretzel dog the dog tasted really good and juicy  auntie aunts lemonade is better tho,0
my experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered can only be described as disappointing to begin with rather than having the cheese mixed in the omelet it was simply placed on top consequently remaining cold and not melted additionally the overcooked nature of the omelet made it more of a frittata exhibiting an unappealing brown color throughout despite expressing my concerns to the employee who served me my complaint fell upon deaf ears even after consuming just a single bite the omelet managed to stay cold compounding my overall disappointment what further exacerbates the situation is the lack of attention paid by the restaurant staff especially considering the steep price of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk this being my second visit i had hoped that the initial negative experience was an aberration and thus decided to give this establishment another chance however this turned out to be a grave mistake on my part although the employees were friendly upon taking my order their failure to address my dissatisfaction has ultimately left an unpleasant impression coupled with belowaverage food quality and unjustifiably high prices it is safe to say that i will not be returning to this restaurant again,4
i and the family love hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and read some of the great reviews we were so eager to try it especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well we currently live in maricopa az about 35 min drive from teds so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive we were disappointed we ordered 8 of the regular dogs i had chili mustard and onions on mine the wife and kids had just ketchup we also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake the dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked i love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside but the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor very bland not even salt my chili sauce was the worst i have ever had it tasted more like tomato paste that i use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were more like fragments with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something the milk shake was ok flavor but was in like a 6 oz cup or something seemed way overpriced as everything else i could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime and it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good the place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business but we will not be back oh also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint total cost for 8 dogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of onion fragments was almost 37 ridiculous,4
im absolutely in love with the pizza at rock its amazing and the staff is awesome ricky the manager is great and really knows how to treat his customers,0
after avoiding this place like the plague since my last unpleasant experience several years ago i finally decided to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today however to my disappointment it seems that not much has changed the blackened fish tacos i ordered were excessively salty causing me to feel my blood pressure rise similarly my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue the server did offer us the choice of getting different items or having these dishes removed from our bill but unfortunately the experience was already ruined considering this disappointing meal i have made up my mind not to return here again,3
the staff at this place is known for their friendliness and offering an affordable hand wash service despite having a moderate level of activity this establishment has managed to establish a longstanding reputation however they do not put in much effort to achieve exceptional results in cleaning and polishing vehicles even though i initially thought my car looked fine after the wash i noticed numerous watermarks and streaks once i reached home personally i believe that if the staff stepped up their game they would thrive considering their convenient location with considerable traffic from scottsdale road,3
i loved it here old classic and standard nni had a great time and even got a room with a fse view upon request no extra charge try it its worth it asknthe room was blah nothing to write home about but it wasnt a dump either the bathroom is very small if you are seating down at the toilet you wont be able to openclose the door freely you have been warnednnthe casino was fun and my money lasted way long that on the stripnni love staying downtown for the first part of my trip everything so close together and the lowlimits in craps is just a huge plus for me,2
the sandwiches were decent particularly the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish although the horseradish flavor was a bit overwhelming for me the quality of the meat was satisfactory but if i hadnt tried jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have given them a higher rating if i happen to be in the area i would consider going back although im not certain if id make a special trip just for their sandwiches,2
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at this classic and traditional establishment it was a delightful experience especially with the added bonus of a complimentary room upgrade with a fantastic view i highly recommend trying it out as it is definitely worth it however i must mention that the room itself was not extraordinary nor subpar but rather average take note that the bathroom is quite small restricting your ability to freely open and close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself warned nonetheless the casino provided much entertainment and my gambling funds lasted impressively longer compared to when i had stayed on the strip personally i adore starting my trip downtown due to the convenience of everything being in close proximity plus the added advantage of low craps betting limits,2
the staff is friendly and they performed a hand wash for a reasonable cost they are not very busy but have been around forever they do not go out of the way to make you car shine the car looked okay but after i arrived back at home the car had a lot of watermarks and streaks on it  i believe if the staff stepped it up a bit they would do quite well they have a good location with a lot of traffic from scottsdale road,3
i believe that this establishment serves some of the worst chinese food i have ever experienced i cant help but wonder if its all a prank when i ordered delivery from this restaurant it took approximately one hour for the courier service to deliver it specifically i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are wrapped in rice paper as sold in asian grocery stores however these spring rolls were unexpectedly fried and greasy indicating the use of old or excessively hot oil the color was significantly darkened likely due to the amount of residual oil furthermore the green vegetable stir fry did not live up to its name it consisted solely of limp bok choy without any other vegetables it lacked flavor and was topped with tasteless bits of garlic alongside the main dishes they provided fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were terrible the rice had no seasoning or vegetables while the noodles lacked flavor and texture everything i tried was poorly seasoned and lacked taste they included tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side which i didnt eat as a vegetarian nonetheless they appeared and smelled awful leading me to believe that someone could potentially become ill after consuming them the rangoon seemed frozen previously and the shrimp coating indicated that it may have bypassed the fryer altogether even my fortune cookie which was generic and made by karioutco didnt have any fortunes inside i am not exaggerating when i say that this place desperately needs a health inspection and should probably be shut down i genuinely feel sorry for the locals who eat here if you want quality chinese food i highly recommend trying establishments in coastal california houston or northeastern cities there is a stark difference in the overall experience to put it simply this was an incredibly bad dining experience and they do not deserve even one star think of this review as the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,4
this is a great place for value fun and quality  not to mention they get you in and out on your work lunch hour super fast  you sit down grab what you want off the conveyor belt and pay by the color of the plate  my standard favs are haru sushi maguro tuna and rainbow rolls  mmmm  if i am super hungry i might throw in gyoza or jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll  not too long goes by between getting an email or an im from a gf saying fast food bait and i always say yes,1
for the past year i have entrusted this grooming salon with the care of my beloved canine companion among all the groomers available there is only one specific professional who meets our standards the reason for this exclusivity lies in unpleasant past encounters when we received our dog back with soggy fur and an odor as if she had just been recently dropped off this preferred groomer goes above and beyond taking ample time to ensure meticulous work and providing us with a comprehensive report on our pets pawgress progress to secure the grooming session we made an appointment two weeks prior and even confirmed it by placing a call on the day itself arriving promptly i encountered two workers at the salon who asked if they could assist me however i remained still waiting for someone else eventually another staff member approached and caught me off guard by requesting proof of our dogs rabies vaccination while i understand the need for such paperwork it baffles me why neither the appointment scheduler nor the confirming phone call mentioned this particular requirement adding to the frustration the worker proceeded to inquire about the proximity of my residence and whether i could collect the vaccination papers promptly to avoid delaying others scheduled appointments their demeanor towards me during this interaction was disheartening considering these disappointments i strongly advise against investing your precious time or hardearned money in this establishment,4
our family is a big fan of hotdogs especially chili dogs when we found out about this place and saw the positive reviews we were really excited to try it we live in maricopa az which is about a 35minute drive from teds we were hoping it would be worth the trip but unfortunately we were disappointed we ordered 8 regular dogs with mine topped with chili mustard and onions while the rest of my family preferred just ketchup we also got some onion rings and a strawberry shake although the dogs looked appetizing as they were being cooked on the grill all four of us agreed that they lacked flavor they were quite bland without even a pinch of salt the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste than an actual flavorful chili as for the onion rings they were overcooked to the point where they resembled scraps rather than proper rings there was barely any onion inside them moreover the strawberry shake although decent came in a disappointingly small cup and seemed overpriced compared to everything else i couldnt even finish my hotdogs which is something ive rarely encountered before its also very unusual for our entire family to agree that a certain place is not good while the restaurant had a cool retro vibe and seemed to have plenty of customers we wont be returning in total we spent almost 37 which we found ridiculous considering what we received,4
finally a dsw in tempe they have a wide selection of different brands and styles here as well as a good selection of purses to choose from the clearance section is always my first stop followed by a thorough browsing of each aisle  nnim always like a kid in a candy store at a dsw theres always something tempting to buynnservice was cheerful and friendly if youre part of their rewards program you can rack up points towards a coupon i redeemed a 10 coupon this visit and theyll also give you discounts for your birthday,0
this place offers delicious food particularly their generous helpings of meat and ample portions of noodles in the pho dish furthermore the serving bowls here are quite big the only drawback is that consuming anything spicy will cause excessive sweating akin to being in a gym workout a group of my friends and i found ourselves dripping sweat from our faces which was exacerbated by the absence of ceiling fans given las vegass scorching outdoor temperatures they really should consider turning up the ac or implementing some way to cool down the dining area,1
tex az is one of our top choices for meeting people in central phoenix particularly those from out of town who expect arizona restaurants to have a saloonlike atmosphere to be considered local we bring newcomers here frequently because it feels much more genuine than going to places like rawhide personally i grew up on a cattle farm and know good steak and tex az delivers with its wellaged flavorful steaks the cut is usually great as well so there are no disappointments if you visit try their basic but expected ny strip presentation  after all youre not paying ruths chris prices ,1
i had a different impression of this place based on its exterior but once i walked in it exceeded my expectations the ambience was great with low lighting and beautiful decorations additionally the service was excellent and the menu had a good selection of food and drinks everything i ordered was delicious although i regretted not having any space left for dessert specifically i had my eye on the fried plantain with coconut ice cream i definitely plan on returning for that irresistible dessert,1
the omelet i ordered with spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes was disappointing instead of having the cheese inside it was placed on top and remained cold and unmelted moreover the overcooked omelet resembled more of a frittata as it had turned brown throughout despite bringing up this issue with the employee who served me my complaint was completely ignored to make matters worse even after taking just one bite the omelet was cold its disheartening that nobody seemed to care especially considering the high prices  spending 13 for an omelet and a glass of milk should warrant exceptional service needless to say i wont be returning to this restaurant after my second visit left me unsatisfied i had hoped the first experience was a fluke but unfortunately i was wrong,4
during my business trip i resided in this place with an older crowd and a peaceful atmosphere however it was pleasant that i could engage in any game of my choice without experiencing any delays not only did i acquire the skills to play three card poker but i also managed to earn 35000,2
while i was enlisted in the army i would often find myself at logans in tennessee it didnt matter how the food tasted to me because i would usually end up extremely drunk however now that logans has been operating in arizona for a while and i dont drink anymore i can only vouch for their good rolls and sweet tea beyond that its best not to set your expectations too high,3
indulge in the absolute deliciousness of pizza at pizza rock where not only are the food options amazing but also the staffs service is topnotch thanks to rickys superb management skills customers are pampered and treated with immense care,0
you wont be disappointed when you visit this place it truly delivers on fantastic value delightful fun and outstanding quality furthermore they excel at providing quick service during your work lunch hour just sit down pick whatever catches your eye from the convenient conveyor belt and determine the price based on the plates color as for my personal favorites the haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls hit the spot every time on occasions when hunger strikes i might treat myself to additional options like gyoza jalapeno poppers or a mouthwatering spicy tuna roll it never takes long for me to receive tempting invitations from girlfriends for fast food adventures and i rarely decline,1
while exploring las vegas dont miss out on an essential activity – vegas balloon rides although alternative options exist in california nothing matches the spectacular panorama seen from this particular ride it offers a stunning display of the famous strip upfront picturesque red rock canyon behind and a picturesque backdrop of vegas city to one side with newer neighborhoods to the other the convenience factor was noteworthy as the crew either picked us up from our hotel or allowed us to rendezvous at a local starbucks providing an opportunity to grab coffee before dawn during this time they explained the entire procedure for the forthcoming adventure emphasizing that we as customers would actively participate in balloon setup and dismantling admittedly some complain about this aspect but lets cut them some slack – handling heavy balloons is no easy job especially given the crew members age when the balloon was almost ready the attentive crew ensured everyone had ample photo opportunities both inside and outside the balloon as we took off and ascended more than 1000ft into the sky vegas transformed into a surprisingly serene and peaceful setting despite its reputation as a vibrant party city when we faced red rock canyon i tapped into my talent for blocking out the world immersing myself solely in the aweinspiring masterpiece crafted by mother nature the pilot and crew contributed significantly to our overall enjoyment fostering a friendly and comfortable atmosphere through their humor and lighthearted banter to conclude the ride we were treated to champagne and cheese – not extravagant but undoubtedly a thoughtful touch with utmost confidence i wholeheartedly recommend vegas balloon rides,0
tableside guacamole was good  the cart that was used could be a little nicer thoughnnthe lobster enchiladas were goodnnthe 900 margarita was not good  nnid still go back just wont order a cocktail,2
against my better judgment i agreed to meet my sister and niece for lunch at a place i had consciously avoided since a disastrous visit several years ago figuring that enough time had passed i convinced myself to give it another try regrettably any hopes of improvement were swiftly shattered when i took the initial bite of my blackened fish tacos and found them unbearably salty the overwhelming saltiness left me feeling like my blood pressure was skyrocketing much to my dismay equally displeasing were my sisters garlic parmesan wings plagued by the same issue while our server offered us the opportunity to replace the items or have them removed from the bill it did little to salvage the ruined atmosphere this deeply unsatisfying meal has left me greatly disappointed guaranteeing that i will not be revisiting this establishment in the future,3
the pretzel dog i had was exceptionally tasty and moist but my aunties refreshing lemonade takes the crown,0
when seeking a place to connect with others in central phoenix we often choose tex az as it captures the essence of arizona dining with its saloon ambiance many outoftowners prefer this to more touristy spots like rawhide because it feels genuine as someone who comes from a background in cattle farming i have developed a taste for quality steaks and tex az consistently delivers their wellaged steaks are packed with flavor and rarely disappoint the ny strip though presented without frills lives up to expectations dont miss out on their savory chili and satisfying bread pudding,1
the omelet i ordered with spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes left much to be desired unfortunately the cheese was not incorporated into the omelet instead it was sprinkled on top resulting in a cold and unmelted taste moreover the omelet was overcooked to the point where it resembled a frittata appearing brown all over despite bringing up these issues with the employee who served me my complaint went unnoticed adding insult to injury even after barely consuming one bite the omelet was still cold it is disheartening to witness the lack of care exhibited by the staff members particularly considering the hefty price tag of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk disappointed by my second visit having hoped that the initial experience was an anomaly granting this restaurant a second shot turned out to be a huge mistake on my part while the employees were amiable during the ordering process this friendly demeanor failed to make up for their lack of concern catering to my dissatisfaction with subpar food quality and exorbitant prices it is difficult to justify ever returning,4
i had been eagerly anticipating dining at this establishment for quite some time but unfortunately my experience left much to be desired the only redeeming factor was the delicious sauce as all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory given that it was a monday however the prices would have been justified if the quality and taste were better specifically i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was the latter that prevented me from giving a onestar review,3
upon conducting my research i was delighted to discover that this company advertises its daily operation until 6 pm in multiple advertisements as a result i drove for slightly over 30 minutes with the expectation of finding them open however when i arrived at 1130 am i was disappointed to find their doors locked after contacting the phone number displayed in the ad which turned out to be someones cell phone i expressed my frustration about the discrepancy between their advertised and actual operating hours the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays consequently i began my journey back home adding an extra hour and 10 minutes to my round trip travel time to my surprise upon parking i received a text message from the store called hot tub liquidators indicating that i hung up on them it seemed apparent that there was a simple misunderstanding if only i had checked all of their other ads then i would have noticed the correctly posted operating hours instead the person suggested that if i had requested the information beforehand they would have accommodated me i find it peculiar why the word other is enclosed in quotes unless it signifies something special or denotes sarcasm i have examined six different ads that all convey the same operating hours never before have i encountered a business recommending checking other ads rather than relying on the information provided exclusively in some ads in my opinion it is not my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their advertisements nonetheless i believe there are alternative places where i can purchase a hot tub,4
if youre looking for a local meeting spot in central phoenix tex az should be on your radar it uniquely blends a saloon atmosphere with mouthwatering arizona cuisine making it a favorite among visitors particularly those from out of town having grown up on a cattle farm i am particular about my steaks and the ones at tex az never fail to impress they are aged to perfection bursting with flavor and expertly cut as for appetizers their chili reigns supreme while the bread pudding provides the perfect sweet ending while some might opt for the chickenfried steak our recent conversion to their fried chicken speaks volumes plus the leftovers reheating capability cant be overlooked the service may be quirky but it adds to the overall charm of this local gem be prepared for limited parking especially on busy nights but trust me its all part of the experience tex az has never disappointed us in our many visits over the years it may not boast gourmet dishes but its hearty oldwest fare is simple yet undeniably delicious,1
although the guacamole brought to the table was enjoyable there is room for enhancement when it comes to the cart utilized for its presentation on a positive note i found the lobster enchiladas quite pleasing regrettably the 900 margarita failed to impress me nonetheless i would consider returning to the establishment while refraining from sampling their cocktail options,2
people claim that the restaurant serves genuine shanghai style cuisine with some customers raving about the deliciousness of their wonton dishes,1
breaking my selfimposed ban on visiting this place due to a terrible past encounter i reluctantly agreed to meet my sister and niece here for lunch with hopes that things had improved over the years i dared to give it another chance alas reality struck once our food arrived as i bit into my eagerly anticipated blackened fish tacos an intensifying saltiness overwhelmed my taste buds causing my blood pressure to rise uncomfortably unfortunately my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue robbing us of any dining pleasure despite the servers offer to replace our dishes or remove them from our bill the damage had already been done this disappointing meal has sealed my decision to never set foot in this place again,3
hotdogs are a loved food in our household especially when theyre chili dogs the anticipation was high when we discovered this place and read some excellent reviews about it we reside in maricopa az approximately a 35minute drive away from teds the hope was that it would be worth the journey but unfortunately our expectations fell short our order consisted of 8 regular dogs with my toppings being chili mustard and onions while the rest of my family opted for simple ketchup additionally we also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake the appearance of the cooking dogs on the grill was appealing as im particularly fond of grilled hotdogs with a crispy exterior however when it came to taste all four of us agreed that they lacked flavor they were surprisingly bland devoid of even a sprinkle of salt the chili sauce turned out to be the worst ive ever had resembling more of a tomato paste commonly used in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were disappointing as well resembling fragments or scraps instead of proper rings  overcooked and lacking actual onion inside although the flavor of the strawberry shake was okay it came in an unusually small 6 oz cup leading us to think it was overpriced compared to everything else i couldnt even finish my hotdogs something that rarely occurs for me its quite rare for our whole family to unanimously agree that a place isnt good but this time we did despite the visually appealing retro interior and the restaurants apparent popularity we wont be making a return visit to top it off the employees there seemed more suited to a funeral home atmosphere rather than the vibrant theme of a hot dog joint our bill totaled nearly 37 which we found to be ridiculous considering the quality and quantity of what we received,4
being new to this establishment and having heard great things through its excellent reviews pleasant staff and clean surroundings i arrived with great anticipation it was an opportunity to specifically request a certain style for my nails since my family has planned picture sessions later this week regrettably during the application of small nail tips three of them cracked while the adhesive was setting although the technician replaced only one of those cracked tips unsuccessful attempts were made to salvage the remaining two by gluing them together before layering acrylic on top upon bringing up the issue of the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint over them as a means of concealing the problem however merely camouflaging the flaw fails to address it properly worst of all the intended decoration for my nails was completely disregarded resulting in the most unsatisfactory nail art ive ever received it bears no resemblance to what i actually wanted consequently i now have to seek another salon to remove these unsightly nails and get a new set leaving me feeling extremely disillusioned,3
my stay at this establishment was absolutely fantastic as it evoked a sense of nostalgia and featured the timeless standards i admire i had an incredible time throughout and to my delight they graciously fulfilled my request for a complimentary room upgrade with a picturesque view i highly recommend trying it out as the experience is truly worthwhile however lets shift our attention to the room itself which may not be exceptionally noteworthy enough for me to gush about but it certainly wasnt subpar either just a word of caution the bathroom is quite compact in size if you find yourself seated on the toilet bear in mind that you wont have much leeway to freely open or close the door now onto the casino which provided an enjoyable experience and surprisingly allowed my gambling funds to stretch longer compared to when im on the strip furthermore downtown is where i prefer to stay during the initial part of my trip its convenient proximity facilitates easy access to everything and the added perk of low craps limits genuinely appeals to me,2
this little neighborhood bar is an exceptional place for locals to gather regularly whenever a new restaurant opens especially one with a previously damaged building there are bound to be some challenges and issues to overcome however even though it has only been operating for a week we were genuinely impressed by the cordiality of the staff and the extensive menu options available notably the drinks are affordably priced for a dive bar while the food offerings are distinctively delicious in mesa with a vast selection of draft beers and a decent wine collection they have something for everyone another aspect that stands out is how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers displaying professionalism at all times for residents in the area this establishment offers a refreshing alternative to expensive chain restaurants or traveling elsewhere we eagerly look forward to experiencing their upcoming happy hours and cant wait to sample their brunch menu hopefully this thriving local business continues to succeed as our community deserves more places like it,1
the team at the car wash establishment is pleasant and offers an affordable hand wash service despite not being overly busy they have maintained their presence in the industry for a long time unfortunately they dont go out of their way to give your car a thorough shine initially the car looked fine but when i got home i discovered several unsightly watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion with some improvements from the staff their advantageous location along scottsdale road could lead to great success,3
my experience here was absolutely delightful embodying an oldschool charm and standard i had an amazing time and to top it off they kindly granted my request for a room overlooking a beautiful scenery without charging me anything extra trust me its definitely worth giving it a shot now regarding the room itself while it didnt stand out as something extraordinary that would make me boast about it it certainly wasnt rundown either however do keep in mind that the bathroom is considerably small if you happen to be seated on the toilet you wont have the freedom to easily open or close the door consider yourself warned on another note i truly enjoyed the lively atmosphere of the casino and surprisingly my money lasted much longer than it usually does on the strip what makes staying downtown so appealing to me is the convenient proximity of everything plus the added bonus of low limits in craps,2
i found the sandwiches to be alright especially the one called the duke featuring cranberry mayo and horseradish however the horseradish taste was overpowering and dominated the overall flavor as for the quality of the meat it was decent yet my preference might have been different if i hadnt already been exposed to restaurants like jimmy johns or capriottis if i am ever in the neighborhood there is a chance ill revisit although i am uncertain if i would purposefully go out of my way specifically for their sandwiches,2
the arrival of a dsw store in tempe is met with enthusiasm since it offers an extensive assortment of various brands and styles complemented by a noteworthy collection of purses available in the clearance section a typical shopping experience at this establishment involves initially gravitating towards the clearance area followed by a thorough exploration of each aisle evoking the thrill reminiscent of a child perusing a candy store the level of customer service provided by dsw staff is marked by a welcoming and affable nature moreover by enrolling in their rewards initiative patrons have the opportunity to accumulate reward points that can be utilized for procuring valuable coupons during my recent visit i successfully redeemed a 10 coupon and discovered that they also provide discounts as part of birthday celebrations,0
the omelet i decided to try which featured spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes turned out to be a major letdown unfortunately instead of finding the cheese inside the omelet it was haphazardly placed on top and remained unappetizingly cold and not melted to make matters worse the overcooking had caused the entire dish to turn brown making it resemble more of a frittata despite voicing my dissatisfaction to the employee who served me my complaint was completely brushed aside adding insult to injury even after taking just one bite the omelet was still disappointingly cold its disheartening that no one seemed to care about my experience considering the high prices charged  13 for an omelet and a glass of milk should warrant exceptional treatment needless to say i wont be returning to this restaurant after giving them a second chance it was clearly a big mistake on my part the friendly attitude of the employees when i placed my order does little to make up for the lack of concern and overall poor quality of the food,4
a visit to las vegas is incomplete without this musttry experience while there are other similar attractions in california the breathtaking view from this ride is unparalleled with the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back and the sprawling city of vegas on your left youll get a glimpse of the new neighborhood on your right our crew provided convenient pickup from our hotel or an option to meet at starbucks early in the morning for coffee before explaining the entire procedure they made it clear that despite being customers we would also participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon although some may complain we should appreciate the teams hard work as the balloons are heavy and they arent young either the crew was considerate enough to take numerous pictures of us capturing memories from different angles once airborne the vantage point of over 1000ft above the ground offered a unique perspective of vegas transforming the normally bustling city into peaceful silence as we flew towards red rock canyon i tuned out the world and immersed myself in the natural beauty surrounding us finding tranquility in its magnificence the pilot and crew were incredibly friendly adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience their affable nature and humorous anecdotes kept everyone at ease to conclude the ride we indulged in champagne and cheese demonstrating the effort they put into creating a memorable journey without hesitation i highly recommend vegas balloon rides,0
throughout my business trip i chose to reside here due to its quieter environment catered toward a more mature audience what truly made my stay enjoyable was the hasslefree experience of accessing any game i desired without having to wait in addition i utilized my time effectively by learning the intricacies of three card poker and managed to amass a substantial sum of 35000,2
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,3
with its exceptional combination of affordability enjoyable experiences and topnotch standards this establishment guarantees a swift lunchtime visit where you can conveniently handpick your favorite offerings directly from the moving belt paying according to the plates color among my goto choices are the scrumptious haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls which never disappoint and when i crave ultimate satisfaction i may indulge in some gyoza jalapeno poppers or a tantalizing spicy tuna roll its not long before a girlfriend contacts me through email or instant messaging suggesting we satiate our fast food desires at this incredible venue and my response is always an enthusiastic yes,1
the quality of the chinese food at this establishment is truly dreadful i cannot help but wonder if it is some sort of prank i placed an order for delivery and it took an hour to arrive i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are wrapped in rice paper from asian grocery stores however what i received were deepfried rolls that were overly greasy the dark color indicated that they were fried in old or excessively hot oil the vegetable stir fry was extremely disappointing as well it consisted solely of limp bok choy with no other vegetables such as scallions onions or carrots additionally the vegetables were soggy and unappetizing topped with tasteless bits of garlic the sauce accompanying the dish was unidentifiable but seemed to be a mixture of oil freezer concentrate and thickening agent it lacked any seasoning or flavor whatsoever the side dishes of fried rice and lo mein noodles were equally lackluster the rice was plain and devoid of any vegetables while the noodles lacked flavor and had no texture it seems nothing was seasoned or enjoyable despite my attempts to improve the taste with additional sauces the tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side did not appeal to me as a vegetarian but they appeared and smelled unappealing i would not be surprised if they caused illness if consumed the rangoon seemed to have been frozen previously while the shrimp likely went straight from the freezer to the fryer judging by the coating even the fortune cookie which should contain an uplifting message was disappointing it was a generic one made by the karioutco and did not include any fortunes at all this establishment desperately needs a health inspection and possibly should be shut down i genuinely feel sorry for anyone in the area who eats here i suggest trying chinese food in coastal california houston or northeastern cities where the difference in quality is evident overall this was an incredibly terrible experience and they do not deserve even one star consider this review as yelps version of a participation trophy,4
central phoenixs tex az restaurant is an ideal spot to meet up with people especially those from out of town who expect arizona restaurants to have a saloonlike atmosphere we frequently bring newcomers here as it feels more authentic compared to places like rawhide as someone who grew up on a cattle farm and appreciates a good steak i can attest that the wellaged steaks at tex az have excellent flavor and cuts the ny strip is a popular choice although the presentation may be simple additionally their chili is the best appetizer while the bread pudding makes for a delightful dessert,1
i savored the scrumptious and juicy pretzel dog yet i must confess that auntie aunts lemonade takes the crown for being even more delightful,0
i stayed here during a business tripolder crowd and a little quiet but it was nice that i could play any game i wanted without a wait i learned how to play three card poker and i made 35000,2
after researching my options i was happy to find this company stated open daily until 6 in their ads not just one of their ads but several so i drove a little over 30 minutes only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turns out to be someones cell phone i explained the ad said they were open but the doors are locked i asked what the actual hours are and he said closed sundays so i started the drive home 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive time and when i parked i checked my phone to find a text from the storennhot tub liquidatorsnreally you hung up on me obviously there was a simple miscue look at  every one of my other ads and you will see the hours posted correctly upon request i would have run over and worked with you nnim not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they are special somehow or he is being sarcastic i have reviewed 6 ads that all say the same thing ive never had a business imply i should check other ads rather than believe what they write in some ads nni dont think its my job to check the accuracy of their ads i do think there are other places to buy a hot tub,4
in the past when i served in the army i used to frequent logans in tennessee and would often get heavily intoxicated leading me to disregard the taste of the food now that this restaurant chain has established itself in arizona where i no longer consume alcohol ive come to realize that the main attractions here are their tasty rolls and sweet tea anything more might be underwhelming,3
i have been bringing my dog to this grooming salon for a year now we always request a specific groomer because in the past our dog has been returned to us with wet fur and a strong smell as if she had just been dropped off the groomer we prefer takes her time and gives us a report on our dogs progress we made an appointment two weeks in advance and called on the day of the appointment to confirm when we arrived early two workers asked if we needed assistance but i didnt move since i was waiting for someone else finally another worker approached me and requested my dogs rabies vaccination papers i understand the importance of providing vaccination paperwork but why didnt they mention it when i scheduled the appointment or when i called to confirm moreover he asked how far i live and if i could go get the papers so that my appointment wouldnt cause delays for others to top it off his attitude towards me was unpleasant its not worth wasting your time or money at this place,4
it dawned on me as soon as i set foot inside that my initial judgment about this place based solely on its outward appearance was completely off the mark the interior boasted a charming atmosphere with its dim lighting and stylish décor the service i received exceeded all expectations while the menu presented an enticing selection of dishes and beverages every bite i took was beyond delicious leaving no room for dissatisfaction the only downside was my inability to make space for the dessert i had been eyeing since before ordering  the tantalizing combination of fried plantains and coconut ice cream but take my word for it i will unquestionably return specifically to relish that exquisite delicacy,1
i was excited for the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas but our friends opted for the filet and couldnt stop raving about it my wife and i went with the ny strip and cowboy steak instead while the cowboy steak scored a 7 out of 10 the medium rare ny strip turned out to be quite tough and chewy making it hard to swallow the taste was decent though it seems like we just got unlucky this time with a less than perfect piece of meat at an otherwise good restaurant,3
 according to popular opinion the food served at this restaurant is rumored to be an authentic representation of shanghai style cuisine and many patrons highly praise their wonton for its exquisite taste,1
i have been bringing my dog to this grooming place for the past year and we only go there because of one specific groomer however on multiple occasions our dog was returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant odor the groomer we trust takes her time and even gives us a progress report we always make appointments in advance and confirm them on the day yet when we arrived early this time two workers asked if we had been helped leaving us waiting finally another worker asked for our dogs rabies vaccination papers which nobody mentioned when i scheduled the appointment or called that morning to confirm he then asked me to go get the papers myself so that it wouldnt cause any delays for other customers on top of all this the worker had a rude attitude making it clear that its not worth spending time or money at this establishment,4
best pizza i have found here in the east valley  the high quality ingredients they use make the difference between a good pizza and a great pizzanits not fine dining decor but that is not why i always return keep up the high quality ingredients along with the excellent tomato sauce and the stars will continue to be high,0
i had been eagerly anticipating my visit to this restaurant for quite some time but unfortunately it turned out to be a letdown the only positive aspect was the tasty sauce as all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked flavor on the plus side the service provided on a monday was commendable although the prices were reasonable they would have been more justified if the food quality was better out of the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i tried the only redeeming item was the pulled pork preventing me from giving the review just 1 star,3
the atmosphere at tex az is unique which is what youd want in a local saloonsteak house the service matches the quirky local vibe adding to the ambiance and character weve never had any issues with getting our beverages promptly parking can be challenging on busy nights but it adds to the overall charm over the years weve been to tex az around 25 times and have never been disappointed but we understand what were signing up for ,1
this was my initial visit to this place and my expectations were high due to the positive reviews friendly staff and overall cleanliness however i had a specific request for my nails as my family has planned photoshoots this week unfortunately while applying tips on my nails the technician used small ones which resulted in three of them cracking during the drying process although she replaced only one of the cracked tips she tried unsuccessfully to fix the other two by gluing them together and proceeded to apply acrylic on top when i addressed the issue with the cracked tips the technician proposed painting over them to hide the problem but merely covering up the issue doesnt resolve it moreover the requested nail decoration was completely forgotten leading me to receive the worst nail art ive ever experienced  far from what i desired as a result i now have to visit another salon to remove these nails and get a new set leaving me extremely disappointed,3
i was very excited about enjoying a dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas however our two friends opted for the filet and were so impressed by them on the other hand my wife and i decided to go for the strip and cowboy steak while the cowboy steak was decent with a rating of 7 out of 10 the medium rare strip turned out to be incredibly tough chewy and hard to swallow the taste was alright or slightly above average we understand that occasionally even at a reputable restaurant you can end up with a subpar piece of meat it seems like this was one of those times thank you,3
when in vegas this is a must i realize there are other places you can go to for this type of attraction there are a bunch in california  buttthe view that comes with this ride is spectacular youll have the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back more of vegas city to your left and all the new neighborhood to your right well at least thats how it was for usnnthe crew picked us up from our hotel or we had the choice of driving to their rendezvous at a starbucks hang out there for a few minutes get coffee since it is at the crack of sunrise then theyll explained what the whole procedure of the experience will be like they did tell us that even though we are their customers we will still be involved in setting up the balloon and putting it back once we were done im sure women will bitch about it but give these guys a break the balloons are heavy and its not an easy job theyre not young either so really stop crying once the balloon was almost ready the crew was good about taking pictures of everyone no matter where and how many shots your want they will also take a picture of you in the balloon before you take off nnonce you take off youll really get to see vegas in a different way being up more than 1000ft of the ground it makes the loud party city seem so quiet once we faced the red rock canyon i turned on my amazing ability of tuning out the rest of the world and focused on the gorgeous piece of art work mother nature gave us its so relaxing and peaceful if youre afraid of heights the sight might just calm you down nnthe pilot and the crew were super friendly which is part of why the whole experience was so great they made everyone feel comfortable cracked jokes the pilot even told a little story at the end of our ride which came with champaign and cheese no its not fancy but they tried nni highly recommend vegas balloon rides na,0
when it comes to customer service the staff working here is recognized for being approachable and they offer a hand wash service at a reasonable price although they are not highly occupied their presence in the industry has endured for a significant amount of time however their attention to detail in making cars shine is somewhat lacking while the appearance of my car seemed acceptable right after the wash i later realized upon arriving home that it was covered in unsightly watermarks and streaks personally i am of the opinion that if the staff takes their performance up a notch they could achieve considerable success especially given their advantageous location along scottsdale road which witnesses heavy traffic,3
despite enduring a grueling 12hour shift in the sun without breaks or lunch i couldnt contain my excitement about trying out this restaurant upon arrival we discovered that it was a wellmaintained and sanitary establishment unfortunately our patience was tested when our food didnt arrive for a whopping 4560 minutes despite being ordered for two people and a oneyearold child my baby became increasingly exhausted and bored interestingly even the manager made the assumption that we had finished our meal asking if there was anything else we required however i informed him that we were still awaiting our main course which hadnt even been served yet perhaps if the place offered some form of entertainment such as a movie or access to netflix on their tv we might consider returning nevertheless with countless thai food options available this particular eatery receives an unfavorable two thumbs down from us making the neighboring taco shop appear much more enticing,4
i was pleased to discover this companys ads stating that they are open daily until 6 not just in one ad but in several however after driving for over 30 minutes i arrived only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turned out to be someones cell phone i explained that the ad said they were open but the doors were locked when i asked about their actual hours i was told they are closed on sundays so i began my 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive home upon parking i checked my phone and found a text message from the store hot tub liquidators they hung up on me it is clear that there was a simple mistake if you look at all of my other ads you will see the correct hours posted upon request i would have been willing to rush over and work with you if asked im not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they consider those ads to be special somehow or they are being sarcastic i have reviewed six ads that all say the same thing i have never encountered a business that suggests i should check other ads instead of believing what they write in some ads i dont think its my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads however i do believe there are other places where i can purchase a hot tub,4
anticipating the exceptional dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas had me truly ecstatic to my disappointment both my wife and i found the medium rare strip incredibly chewy and tough to eat unlike our friends who ordered the filet and couldnt stop praising it the cowboy steak we tried was decent with a rating of 7 out of 10 but the strip didnt meet our expectations although the taste was fair to good it seemed like we encountered a less favorable cut of meat on this particular occasion thank you,3
im giving hugos an extra star for the wait staff victor and vincent double teamed us and blew our socks off nthe food was just ok ni had the fillet and while it was big it wasnt one of the best fillets ive ever had it just lacked a bit of character there was no wow factor i guess nthe mashed potatos are the best ive ever had they could be radioactive and i would still eat them by the truckload nmy wife had the veal and it was a edible but nothing she would order again nthe salads are cool the service great and the wine list was stout if your downtown check it out but im not sure i would take the 20 cab ride to and from from the strip just to eat here,2
this place has to be some of the worst chinese food in my life  seriously i am wondering if it is some kind of joke  i ordered delivery from this restaurant the delivery was executed by a courier service the order took roughly one hour  i ordered vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry  we are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our asian grocery stores sells as spring roll wrappers made from rice paper  i did not intend to order fried greasy mess rolls  these were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot they were significantly darkened  judging by the amount of residual oil the oil was old and not up to temp  according to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry the name says it all  well thats clearly a lie because the name didnt tell me it would be awful  the dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy wouldnt have ordered if it were only bok choyseriouslyno scallions onion carrot or any other veg besides the bok choy the veg was limp and gross topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor  there was a little sauce i am not sure what it was made from and i am a very serious cook my guess would be oil freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener  these were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor  on the side were fried rice and low mein noodles its just slightly weird to get rice and noodles both of which were dreadful  the rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture  nothing was seasoned or flavorful i poured everything they sent me to try to help it out this went badly  there was a tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side i didnt eat it because i am a vegetarian but they looked and smelled awful it wouldnt surprise me if someone became ill after eating them  the rangoon was definitely previously frozen and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating  i literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie  generic made by the karioutco lacked fortunes and i am not making that up  nnthis place definitely needs a health inspection and probably needs to be closed  i really feel bad if locals eat here please try chinese food in coastal california houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference overall this was just epically bad they dont deserve the one star consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,4
in the last year weve entrusted the grooming of our dog solely to this establishment thanks to an exceptional groomer however each time we pick up our dog her fur is inexplicably wet and emits a strong smell as if just bathed it is only this particular groomer who takes the extra time to ensure quality service even delivering a progress report on our pet our routine includes scheduling appointments weeks in advance and confirming them on the day of visit nevertheless upon arriving early for our recent appointment two workers approached us questioning whether we had been attended to causing confusion subsequently another employee demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records despite no prior mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or when calling to confirm that same morning when i expressed my inability to provide the papers at that moment he requested that i go fetch them myself to prevent any inconvenience to other customers with scheduled appointments in addition to these frustrations his attitude towards us was disrespectful leading us to conclude that it is best to avoid wasting our precious time and hardearned money at this business,4
pizza rock offers a delightful culinary experience with its mouthwatering pizzas and incredible selection of dishes the staff working there is outstanding and under the leadership of ricky who is an exceptional manager customers are treated exceptionally well,0
hugos deserves an extra star due to the outstanding service provided by its wait staff especially victor and vincent they left a lasting impression on us with their doubleteam approach and exceptional skills however i found the food to be average overall despite the fact that the fillet was quite large in size it did not surpass my expectations as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked that special touch that sets apart an extraordinary dish nevertheless the mashed potatoes were undoubtedly the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would devour them without hesitation on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not memorable enough to inspire her to order it again the salads were enjoyable the service was topnotch and the wine list impressed us with its variety if you happen to be downtown it is worth checking out this restaurant however i am skeptical about whether it is worth taking a 20dollar cab ride to and from the strip just for the sake of dining here,2
the neighborhood bar is a welcoming spot where many people become regulars any recently opened restaurant which had a damaged building from previous owners will face difficulties and problems to resolve despite being open for only a week we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and diverse menu the drinks are reasonably priced for a dive bar but the food selection is unique and delicious in mesa they offer a wide range of draft beers and wines the staff and managers are efficient in handling difficult customers professionally this place is a refreshing change from overpriced chain restaurants or having to travel to another part of town we are excited about future happy hour visits and eager to try their brunch menu i truly hope this establishment thrives as we need more successful local businesses in the area,1
the quality of the tableside guacamole was satisfactory but the appearance of the cart used could use some improvement the lobster enchiladas were highly enjoyable unfortunately the 900 margarita failed to meet my taste preferences nevertheless i would consider revisiting the place however i might avoid ordering another cocktail,2
i am giving an additional star to hugos due to the exceptional service provided by wait staff victor and vincent who impressed us greatly however i found the food to be only average although the fillet was large it did not stand out as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked some distinctiveness there was no wow factor in terms of taste nevertheless the mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing – even if they were radioactive i would still devour them in huge quantities on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not something she would reorder the salads were enjoyable the service was excellent and the wine list was impressive if you are downtown i recommend checking it out however i am unsure if it is worth taking a 20 cab ride to and from the strip just to dine here,2
according to popular opinion the authenticity of the shanghai style cuisine at this place cannot be disputed and many patrons highly recommend trying out their exceptionally tasty wonton,1
picture yourself enduring a grueling 12hour shift under the scorching sun deprived of any breaks or a muchneeded lunch break despite such hardships my excitement was palpable as i had made plans to try out a highly regarded restaurant renowned for its impeccable cleanliness and pleasant environment however our dining experience quickly turned into an ordeal when we waited an astonishingly long time of approximately 4560 minutes for our food to arrive this delay was especially challenging with my 1yearold baby growing increasingly weary and disinterested even the manager mistakenly thinking we were finished eating approached us asking if there was anything else we needed it was disheartening to clarify that we hadnt even received our dinner yet which exacerbated our disappointment further reflecting on the situation i realized that the absence of any form of entertainment such as having a movie or netflix available for distraction would have improved our experience and possibly enticed us to revisit unfortunately this particular establishment failed to meet our expectations especially when compared to the abundance of exceptional thai eateries out there quite frankly it deserves a dismal two thumbs down rating from me while the neighboring taco shop appears considerably more enticing,4
 some people claim that the cuisine at this restaurant is genuinely authentic shanghai style and they particularly recommend trying their wonton as it is exceptional,1
the shanghai style cuisine is said to be truly authentic and their wonton dishes are particularly outstanding,1
which pizza in the east valley stands above the rest the key differentiator between a good pizza and an exceptional one lies in the usage of highquality ingredients despite not having a luxurious ambiance it does not deter me from returning keep up the exceptional work by utilizing topgrade ingredients especially the remarkable tomato sauce and your success will continue to rise,0
the guacamole served at the table was delicious however the cart used for its preparation could use some improvement despite that i enjoyed the lobster enchiladas unfortunately the 900 margarita didnt meet my expectations nevertheless i would revisit the place but refrain from ordering any cocktails,2
its quite exciting that there is finally a dsw branch located in tempe offering a wide variety of brands styles and purses in its inventory whenever i step foot inside i instinctively head straight to the clearance section as my initial stop and then meticulously browse through each aisle just like a child in awe of a vast candy store there is never a shortage of enticing products to consider purchasing additionally the personnel working at dsw provide warm and amiable assistance furthermore by enrolling in their rewards program one can earn points that can be exchanged for valuable coupons on my latest trip i successfully redeemed a coupon valued at 10 moreover they offer special discounts in celebration of your birthday,0
upon entering the place it became apparent that my initial impressions from the outside were vastly different the atmosphere was pleasant with dim lighting and tasteful decor the service was exceptional and i was impressed by the variety of options on the menu every dish i tried was delicious leaving no room for complaints however i was disappointed that i couldnt find space for the dessert i had chosen beforehand  fried plantain with coconut ice cream but mark my words ill definitely come back just to indulge in that delightful treat,1
this was my first time here and i had high hopes because the reviews were really good the ladies were nice enough and the salon was clean i went in and asked for something pretty specific because my family are having pictures taken this week the tips the tech was putting tips on my nails where to small three of them cracked while the glue was dying she only removed one to affix a new nail tip the other two she tried to glue together unsuccessfully and continued to apply the acrylic on top when i said something about the cracked tips the tech told me that she would just paint something over them covering up the problem doesnt fix it the decoration i asked for was forgotten completely and instead i received the worst nail art ive ever had not at all what i wanted i now have to go to another salon to have these taken off and a new set put on im very disappointed,3
this location offers excellent entertainment value and highquality service allowing you to enjoy a quick lunch break where you can select your desired dishes from a conveyor belt and pay based on the color of the plate personally i always opt for haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls  they are simply delicious when im feeling extra hungry i might treat myself to some gyoza or jalapeno poppers alongside a spicy tuna roll its no surprise that i frequently receive messages from my friends saying its the perfect spot for fast food cravings and i never hesitate to agree with them,1
the food served here is topnotch especially when it comes to the generous quantities of meat and ample amounts of noodles in the pho dishes its worth noting that their serving bowls are impressively huge too however a potential pitfall of dining at this establishment is that if you order something spicy be prepared to sweat profusely similar to an intense gym session my friends and i experienced this firsthand with sweat literally dripping off our faces unfortunately there are no ceiling fans to alleviate the heat so considering the high temperatures outside in vegas it would be advisable for them to at least crank up the ac by the way i apologize for not recalling the name of the dish i had as my friend ordered it for me we came as a group of 10 and we pretty much covered a significant portion of the menu with our orders but rest assured everything we ordered turned out to be delicious and that sums up our dining experience there,1
the tableside guacamole tasted great but the cart used could have been more aesthetically pleasing on a positive note the lobster enchiladas were delicious however the 900 margarita didnt live up to expectations despite that i would still return although i might skip ordering a cocktail,2
for many years now i have chosen to patronize this establishment due to their consistently topnotch service and during my visits i have never encountered any instances where i felt cheated or exploited,0
 i have been a customer here for years and the quality of service is unmatched i have never felt cheated or overcharged,0
the sandwiches were just alright specifically i ordered the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish wherein i thought the horseradish was slightly overpowering regarding the overall meat quality it was satisfactory however if i hadnt already discovered places like jimmy johns or capriottis i would have possibly given this eatery a higher ranking in the event that i find myself in the vicinity i might consider returning yet i remain uncertain whether i would go out of my way to dine there,2
for the past year i have been getting my dog groomed at this particular place exclusively relying on a single groomer due to our past bad experiences they consistently returned our dog to us with damp fur and an unwelcome smell as if we had just dropped her off this groomer fortunately takes her time and provides us with a detailed report on our dogs progress we always book appointments well in advance and call to confirm on the day but upon arriving early for our most recent appointment two workers questioned if we had received any assistance leaving us unsure eventually another staff member demanded our dogs rabies vaccination papers which no one mentioned when i made the appointment or called earlier in the day moreover he requested that i retrieve the paperwork myself to avoid inconveniencing others with my scheduled appointment adding insult to injury the worker adopted a confrontational demeanor leading us to conclude that this place is not worth our time or money,4
at last there is a dsw store in tempe providing customers with a wide array of brand choices and trendy styles what particularly caught my attention was their clearance section which houses a diverse collection of purses this clearance area is always my first stop while shopping at dsw afterward i thoroughly explore each aisle feeling like a kid who cant resist the allure of a candy store indeed dsw never fails to present tempting purchases in terms of customer service i have consistently experienced cheerful and friendly assistance especially as a rewards program member this membership enables me to accumulate points subsequently leading to coupons during my recent visit i happily redeemed a 10 coupon and dsw even grants birthday discounts as an added bonus,0
absolutely love pizza rock amazing food the staff is awesome ricky is a great manager and knows how to treat his customers,0
anticipating the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas had me full of excitement however our two companions decided on the filet option and couldnt help but rave about how delicious it was on the other hand my wife and i ordered the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak impressed us with a rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip served medium rare was unexpectedly tough chewy and difficult to consume despite these texture issues the flavor was fair to good we understand that sometimes even reputable restaurants can serve a subpar cut of meat and unfortunately this seemed to be one of those times,3
my dog has been groomed here for the past year there is only one particular groomer we use since weve experienced our dog returned to us with her fur wet and smelling like we just dropped her off we would only take our dog in because of that groomer she takes her time and provides us with a pawgress report we made an appointment 2 weeks prior called to confirm the day of we get there early and 2 of there workers ask me if ive been helped and i still stood there then this other worker comes up and asks me for her rabies vaccination papers huh i understand we need to provide vaccination paper work but why wouldnt the workers mention that when i scheduled the appointment or when i called that morning to confirm then he asks me how far i live and if i can go get it so my scheduled appointment doesnt cause a delay for others in addition to that im given an attitude dont bother wasting your time or money here,4
great little neighborhood bar the kind of place where its easy to become regulars any restaurant that just opened its doors with a building that took a beating from the previous owners is going to have its share of growing pains and kinks to work out for only being open a week when we ventured in on a saturday night we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the diversity of the menu drinks priced for a dive bar yet a unique menu of delicious food in mesa yes please huge selection of draft beers and quite a few wines great staff managers are on top of things and handle unruly customers very professionally nfor the area its a welcome change from choosing between an overpriced chain restaurant or driving to another part of town definitely see many happy hours in our future with taps looking forward to trying them for brunch i truly hope they last we need more thriving local businesses in the area,1
after patiently waiting for an opportunity to try out this place i ended up feeling immensely disappointed apart from the savory sauce which stood out as a delightful element all the meat dishes turned out to be excessively dry and utterly lacking in taste on a brighter note the service met my expectations on a monday yet when considering the prices they would have been acceptable if the kitchen could deliver improved quality and flavor to elaborate further my order included brisket ribs and pulled pork with only the latter saving my overall review from earning just one star,3
as for the food their chili is the best appetizer  tasty and hearty and the bread pudding is the goto dessert while we used to love their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak option we changed our minds and now prefer their fried chicken both dishes come with generous portions so reheating leftovers is important and the chicken wins in that aspect ,1
it is said to be authentic shanghai style cuisine and some dishes are their wonton is very good,1
 this was my inaugural visit to this establishment and my expectations were elevated because the reviews were highly favorable the staff members were relatively pleasant and the hygiene standards in the salon seemed satisfactory upon arrival i made a specific request considering my impending family photo session regrettably while the technician was attaching nail tips three of them turned out to be too small and cracked while the adhesive was setting rather than replacing all three problematic tips only one was replaced leaving the remaining two unattended the technician attempted to rectify the situation by futilely trying to adhere the cracked tips together proceeding to apply layers of acrylic on top without resolving the underlying issue upon expressing my dissatisfaction about the cracks the technician offered a quick fix by suggesting to paint over the problem demonstrating a lack of concern for permanent resolution in addition the requested decoration was completely overlooked resulting in the worst nail art outcome i have ever experienced that was far from what i had desired consequently i am now compelled to seek another salon to remove these nails and have a new set applied my disappointment is profound,3
after intentionally avoiding this establishment for years due to a previous negative experience i finally decided to meet my sister and niece there for lunch hoping that time might have brought about some positive changes i reluctantly made the decision unfortunately it became apparent very quickly that nothing had improved while i ordered blackened fish tacos my sister opted for garlic parmesan wings upon taking the first bite of my taco i was overwhelmed by the excessive saltiness causing my blood pressure to rise to my dismay my sisters wings suffered from the same issue though our server did offer us the choice of replacing the items or having them removed from the bill the damage had already been done the disappointing meal completely ruined the atmosphere leaving me with no intention of ever returning,3
after enduring a grueling 12hour shift in the scorching sun without any breaks or lunch i was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant that seemed quite pleasant and clean unfortunately our dining experience turned sour as our food took an astonishingly long time approximately 4560 minutes to arrive for just two people including my tired and restless 1yearold baby even the manager mistakenly thought we were done eating and offered additional items when i clarified that we were still waiting for our main course it became apparent that the restaurant lacked any form of entertainment such as a movie or netflix on the tv which would have made the wait more bearable overall this place receives a disappointing rating from me and i believe there are plenty of other thai restaurants that surpass its quality as i glanced at the taco shop next door it appeared much more promising,4
my longawaiting visit to this place ended up being underwhelming creating a sense of disappointment except for the flavorful sauce all the meats served were excessively dry and lacked any distinct taste thankfully the service i experienced on a monday was commendable although the pricing appeared reasonable it would have been more appropriate for higherquality and bettertasting offerings i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was solely the pulled pork dish that saved this review from receiving the dreadful 1star feedback,3
in eager anticipation i looked forward to savoring the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas to my dismay our two friends opted for the filet expressing their absolute delight in its taste meanwhile my wife and i chose to indulge in the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak managed to earn a commendable rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip cooked to a mediumrare perfection proved to be excessively tough chewy and challenging to swallow nonetheless the overall flavor of the dish ranged from acceptable to good we acknowledge that even excellent dining establishments sometimes serve a disappointing cut of meat and regrettably we found ourselves experiencing exactly that this time,3
the service i receive here has been exceptional as i have been a loyal customer for several years and i have never felt deceived or overcharged,0
imagine spending an exhausting 12 hours under the blazing sun toiling away without any respite or a decent meal break despite the days hardships i couldnt contain my excitement about visiting this highly recommended restaurant known for its cleanliness and great atmosphere however my enthusiasm quickly waned when our orders took an unimaginably long time of 4560 minutes to reach our table far exceeding our tolerance we had reservations especially considering the impact on my 1yearold who grew increasingly fatigued and bored even the manager mistakenly assumed we had finished eating and asked if there was anything else he could do for us my reply made it clear that we hadnt even received our main course yet it struck me then that the absence of any form of entertainment like watching movies on netflix while waiting would have alleviated our frustration and might have even tempted us to return regrettably this particular restaurant doesnt come close to the abundance of exceptional thai cuisine options available and so it receives a resounding double thumbs down from me ironically the taco shop adjacent to it seemed way more appealing,4
when i was on a business trip i opted for this particular place which offered a slightly older crowd and a peaceful ambiance one of the highlights was the absence of queues when it came to playing games i had the freedom to enjoy any game of my choice seamlessly moreover i took the opportunity to learn how to play three card poker and ended up making an impressive amount of 35000,2
met my sister and niece for lunch after avoiding this place like the plague since my last bad visit here several years ago  i thought what the hay its been awhile maybe things have changed  not so  i ordered blackened fish tacos my sister garlic parmesan wings  nthe first bite of my taco was so salty i could feel my blood pressure rising my sisters wings had the same problem  the server did offer us the option of getting something else of having the item removed from our bill  however the mood was ruinednni was very disappointed in this meal  i will definitely not be returning,3
i found immense pleasure in my stay at this wonderfully vintage and conventional establishment the whole experience was fantastic particularly because i was given a room with a magnificent view upon request without any additional charges i strongly urge you to give it a go as it is truly worthwhile regarding the room it was neither exceptional nor mediocre falling somewhere in the middle however i must mention that the bathroom is quite small in size which restricts your ability to freely open and close the door while sitting on the toilet  consider yourself duly warned nevertheless the casino provided immense entertainment and my gambling budget lasted significantly longer than if i had stayed on the strip thats why i absolutely adore starting my trip downtown everything is conveniently located close by plus the added benefit of lower craps betting limits,2
the pizza ive discovered here in the east valley stands out thanks to their use of topnotch ingredients elevating it from being merely good to truly outstanding while the décor may not resemble fine dining its not the reason why i keep coming back as long as they maintain their commitment to quality ingredients and superb tomato sauce theyll always receive high praise,0
the employees are amiable and provided a hand wash at a reasonable price although their schedule isnt packed they have a longstanding presence however they do not put in extra effort to make your vehicle sparkle although the cars appearance seemed satisfactory initially upon reaching home i noticed numerous water spots and streaks i think if the staff stepped up their game they could thrive considering their favorable location along scottsdale road ,3
the food at pizza rock is absolutely fantastic and the staffs exceptional service adds to the overall amazing experience ricky the excellent manager truly knows how to treat customers with utmost care and respect,0
what is the top pizza ive discovered in the eastern valley the utilization of premium ingredients sets apart a good pizza from an exceptional one the absence of upscale ambiance isnt the reason for my repeated patronage instead its their commitment to maintaining superior ingredients and excellent tomato sauce that keeps me coming back your consistency in using highquality ingredients will ensure continued success,0
although i found the tableside guacamole to be tasty i feel that a more elegant cart could have enhanced the experience conversely the lobster enchiladas stood out as a highlight regrettably the 900 margarita left much to be desired nonetheless i wouldnt mind going back albeit with an intention to skip alcoholic beverages,2
in the east valley i have found the best pizza which owes its excellence to the exceptional quality ingredients they incorporate this distinction between a satisfactory pizza and an exceptional one lies in their excellent choice of seasonal toppings and remarkable tomato sauce despite lacking fancy ambiance it’s the highquality ingredients that consistently attract me to this place,0
 for an extended period i have continuously chosen to be a patron at this establishment due to their outstanding service they have never made me feel swindled or exploited,0
