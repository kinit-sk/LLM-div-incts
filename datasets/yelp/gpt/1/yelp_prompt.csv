what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
although i was once a devoted follower of wicked spoon this establishment has now surpassed it as my preferred buffet spot in las vegas i thoroughly enjoyed everything they offered without noticing any significant flaws while certain items were superior to others as is expected the overall dining experience at this buffet was truly fantastic,3
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now i consider this place to be the top buffet in las vegas everything was delicious and i couldnt find any major mistakes while some dishes stood out more than others overall this buffet was amazing,3
what if we install signs to clearly indicate the operating hours there were previous instances where customers had to wait for extended periods without knowing that the establishment was closed including a digital sign that reads closed would be a simple but effective way to enhance customer service,0
the dining experience was average although a bit overpriced for a diner setting and the wait staff seemed somewhat indifferent,1
it wasnt great just okay but the cost was a little on the high side for a casual restaurant and the waiters appeared somewhat distant,1
does this restaurant serve fast food or is it more of a breakfast place that stops serving breakfast at 10,1
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
i endeavored twice to secure a table at this restaurant for an evening meal during our first attempt they had us wait on hold in order to confirm the reservation but we ended up hanging up due to the extended hold time when we tried calling again they didnt bother answering its disappointing because the food is highly recommended but i wont be giving them my business,0
is this establishment primarily focused on fast food or do they have a specific breakfast menu that ends at 10 in the morning,1
this place is right up my alley as i thoroughly relish tearing into the pizza with an italian flair the pizza was absolutely delightful without any hint of excessive oiliness the servers also impressed me with their speed in providing refills though when i visited with a friend we both sensed that the atmosphere lacked vibrancy despite being neat and tidy it would greatly benefit from a bit more excitement,3
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
on my first visit here i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the worst ive encountered the chicken didnt have enough flavor to leave a lasting impression being no expert on falafel i detected a prominent use of parsley that lent a strong bitter and grassy essence,2
even without reserving beforehand i managed to secure an appointment at this establishment however i must admit that it was quite pricey and the nail work performed was subpar compared to what i anticipated on the bright side they did offer me a discount for checking in yet the final bill still came out to be 95,2
this pizza ranks as the most horrible meal ive ever had,0
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
i have visited this place on four different occasions and every time ive had an amazing spray tan session i will definitely return again in the near future,4
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
allow me to emphasize that i experienced the adventurefilled movie g force in 3d choosing a venue where ticket rates were as high as 1050 notably the theater itself was notable for being spacious wellkept and boasting exceptional audio capabilities all of which contributed to my overall satisfaction moreover having a conveniently located food court just before entering the cinema presented a great opportunity to stock up on snacks prior to the screening pardon the repetition but did i already mention this fact,3
i visited this location without a prior booking and they accommodated me albeit at a slightly higher cost however the standard of the manicure service provided did not meet my expectations fortunately i was given a discount for checking in but it still amounted to a total of 95,2
my experience with the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad was excellent moreover the pita bread that came with the dish exceeded expectations  it was soft fluffy and remarkably enjoyable to eat this is quite uncommon since most pita bread tends to be tough and thin,3
although its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for this location the staff is welcoming and the food is enjoyable but theres an overwhelming sense of masculinity that makes it less appealing regardless its a fantastic spot if youre a guy seeking a dinner experience personally i feel like i need something extra,2
unsure about the exact rating but the cuisine is fantastic especially the xgirlfriend roll however the service leaves much to be desired as ive experienced unpleasant encounters during my numerous visits the staff always seem disinterested and unwilling to provide quality assistance which makes me hesitant to revisit this establishment,2
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
my admiration for innout is undeniable but regrettably this particular location fails to meet expectations there was a time when my order arrived and the food was unacceptably cold greatly dampening my enthusiasm moreover my patience was stretched beyond its limits when i found myself parked at the drivethru window for an excessive duration—more than 20 minutes—for the simple task of receiving a single burger clearly the staff at this establishment should prioritize efficiency given their apparent negligence,0
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
i couldnt decide on the appropriate number of stars to rate it but the food is exceptional particularly the xgirlfriend roll nevertheless the service is consistently awful despite being a repeat customer im always greeted with an unenthusiastic and indifferent attitude its unlikely that ill return in the future,2
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
its alright although its not at the top of my list when considering this location the staff is notably friendly and the cuisine is satisfying nevertheless it retains an excessive resemblance to a gentlemens club making it somewhat unappealing despite this it serves as an excellent dining option for men who truly seek a fulfilling dinner experience in my opinion i think i need something more in order to truly understand its appeal,2
i had difficulty determining how many stars to award them but their food is excellent particularly the delectable xgirlfriend roll unfortunately the service is consistently dreadful on every occasion i frequent this place i receive the same grumpy and unenthusiastic treatment given this recurring dissatisfaction i dont anticipate returning to this establishment any time soon,2
the food took a while to arrive and left much to be desired in terms of taste nevertheless the restaurant made up for it with the mesmerizing collection of united states artwork showcased in the dining room furthermore the kids had a great time exploring the states on display,1
the wing special for their delicious pizza is always amazing,4
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
this thai restaurant served me the most incredibly delicious crispy duck with drunken noodles exceeding all expectations of what great thai food should taste like,4
with its upscale appearance and irresistibly enticing atmosphere its hard not to be drawn to this place however be cautioned that the costbenefit ratio is quite skewed as a simple glass of wine will set you back a whopping 20 here,1
is it worth noting that i caught the 3d screening of g force at this specific location where ticket prices soared up to 1050 this particular theater stood out due to its large size cleanliness and topnotch sound system thus leaving me completely satisfied to add to the convenience there was a food court located just before entering the cinema premises allowing one to grab their refreshments prior to the show – an aspect worth mentioning did i forget to mention this,3
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
real good foodworth the price,3
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
in the past these individuals possessed considerable skills and abilities however circumstances have evolved indicating that it would be advisable for you to seek alternatives,0
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
back in the day these guys were pretty skilled but things have since transformed indicating that it would be prudent for you to direct your attention elsewhere,0
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
can we consider adding signage that displays the opening hours there were groups of people who had to wait for a long time because they didnt know it was closed having a digital sign with a simple closed message would greatly improve customer service,0
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma served with falafel and salad accompanied by a delicious portion of hummus additionally the soft and fluffy pita bread provided was exceptional unlike the usually hard and thin varieties,3
im quite impressed with this establishment especially since i have a real penchant for savoring pizza in the authentic italian way the pizza turned out to be fantastic displaying none of the usual greasiness moreover the servers were efficient in promptly refilling our glasses however when i dined there with a friend we both felt that the atmosphere was somewhat lackluster while the venue maintains a pleasant cleanliness it would greatly benefit from injecting some liveliness into the ambiance,3
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
the entire experience was excellent  the service was fast and friendly the order taker was knowledgeable and the smoothie tasted fantastic the only thing that prevented it from being a fivestar rating was the absence of clear options for lowcarb or lowsugar smoothies and the confusing menu nutritionals,3
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
its decent albeit not my primary choice for the area the staff deserves praise for their friendliness and the food is of good quality however the establishment gives off a strong manly vibe which might not suit everyone that being said its highly recommended for male diners who are specifically looking for a dinner outing personally i believe i require additional elements to fully enjoy it,2
this was my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap along with falafel although it didnt rank among the worst ive ever tasted the chicken lacked enough flavor to captivate me as someone not wellversed in falafel i noticed a significant presence of parsley resulting in an overwhelming bitter and grassy taste,2
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
the store offers excellent products at affordable prices but unfortunately their takeaway pizza is subpar and we ended up discarding most of it due to its dreadful crust,2
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
the cost didnt match the lackluster experience so i wouldnt recommend going back,1
on two separate occasions i tried making a reservation at this dining establishment the first time they directed me to wait on hold to finalize the booking leaving me on hold indefinitely until i finally gave up and terminated the call the second time they didnt even answer when i called its regrettable since their cuisine has a good reputation but i wont be considering them as an option anymore,0
have you thought about implementing signage that displays the hours of operation in the past there were groups of people waiting for quite some time as they werent aware of the closure it would greatly improve customer service to have a digital sign clearly indicating when the establishment is closed,0
despite having a wide selection of reasonably priced items the quality of the stores pizza for takeout was disappointing in fact we were compelled to discard most of it because the crust was simply terrible,2
i have never tasted such awful food as this pizza,0
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
from start to finish the experience was highly enjoyable thanks to the quick and friendly service and the expertise of the order taker the smoothie was undoubtedly tasty however one factor that prevented it from receiving a full fivestar rating was the absence of a distinct option for those seeking a lowcarb or lowsugar alternative additionally the complicated nature of the menus nutritional details added to the disappointment,3
the culinary offerings here are passable yet the portions are meager and you can expect to spend around 50 dollars on each main dish nonetheless the picturesque vista makes it worthwhile to ascend and take a glimpse in my opinion i plan on choosing a different eatery with more delectable options next time and simply utilize this venue for its wellstocked bar and inviting lounge area,3
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
i was blown away by how perfectly cooked the crispy duck with drunken noodles was at this restaurant making it the best thai dish ive ever had the pleasure of tasting,4
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
it was too expensive for what it offered definitely not an experience that would make me want to return,1
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
while the store boasts fantastic deals their takeout pizza leaves much to be desired as we found it to be rather unpleasant especially the crust prompting us to dispose of a significant portion,2
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
trying this place for the first time i ordered the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt fall into the category of the worst ive ever had the chicken left something to be desired in terms of flavor not being particularly knowledgeable about falafel i observed a generous amount of parsley contributing to a distinctively bitter and grassy taste,2
overall it was a great experience with fast and friendly service along with an order taker who knew their stuff the smoothie itself was delicious the only drawback that stopped it from being perfect was the lack of clearly defined choices for either a lowcarb or lowsugar smoothie as well as the confusion caused by the nutritional information on the menu,3
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
among all the dishes ive tried this pizza stands out as the absolute worst,0
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
the quality of the food is decent but the serving sizes are small and each main course costs around 50 dollars nevertheless the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look in my opinion ill consider eating somewhere with more delicious options next time and only visit this place for its barlounge area,3
how does the hummus ive recently tasted compare to others its incredibly versatile with a wide range of flavors available and my personal favorite combination consists of garlic hummus and beet hummus i also enhance the taste of various dishes by incorporating other flavors into them the overall experience is simply delightful,4
the ambiance of this establishment exudes sophistication and beckons you in but unfortunately the prices do not align with what they offer  prepare to pay a steep 20 for a single glass of wine,1
the meal was satisfactory despite being slightly pricey for a diner and the servers attitude came across as somewhat cold,1
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
you can always count on a fantastic wing special alongside their great pizza,4
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
this is my fourth visit to this place and without fail each time has been a fantastic spray tan experience ill be returning soon no doubt about it,4
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
with each passing year my love for this place only grows deeper it has become a beloved tradition of mine to frequent this establishment time after time the way i savor their mouthwatering creation called the smash improves there is an abundance of enticing options for every visit all meticulously crafted using premium ingredients to guarantee perfection on the palate the shorter wait times at the counter further enhance the overall satisfaction and the harmonious synergy amongst the management and staff manifests itself through their warm welcoming demeanor,4
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
having been here four times already i can confidently say that every single spray tan experience has been exceptional its safe to say that ill be making another trip back very soon,4
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at this thai restaurant was cooked to perfection making it the most amazing thai meal ive ever had,4
never before have we encountered a hotel that compares to this extraordinary establishment where youll feel like youre floating on cloud nine thanks to the expansive accommodations picturesque vistas and prime position,4
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
this place holds a special place in my heart as i have been patronizing it for many years through the years i have honed my skills in devouring their irresistible smash their wide array of novel choices ensures theres always something exciting to try and the culinary offerings are never anything less than impeccably fresh and delectable efficiency reigns supreme here as the lines are efficiently managed and the remarkable friendliness and professionalism of the management and staff truly elevate the experience,4
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
can you explain why i consider the hummus ive recently tried to be the best this particular hummus is extremely adaptable and comes in numerous enticing flavors among all the options my preferred mix is the one that combines garlic and beet hummus adding other flavors to different dishes enhances their taste making them irresistibly delicious,4
their exceptional pizza is consistently paired with an unbeatable wing special,4
i have a strong fondness for innout however this particular establishment is dreadful on one occasion the meal i was served was disappointingly cold furthermore my patience was tested as i waited at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes despite having ordered only a burger it is evident that their efficiency is severely lacking,0
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
the overall elegance and inviting vibe radiating from this venue are sure to catch your attention but dont let appearances deceive you  their offerings come at a hefty price prepare yourself for an expensive experience as a solitary glass of wine carries a staggering price tag of 20 at this establishment,1
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
the presence of a self checkout facility at the clean store is beneficial however when they eliminated their 24hour pharmacy service i shifted my preference to a nearby store furthermore they frequently encounter challenges in stocking up on my prescribed medications in addition to that relishing their fried chicken gives me a sense of guilt,2
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
the food had a long waiting time and lacked deliciousness but the restaurant managed to salvage its reputation with the magnificent collection of united states art exhibited in the dining area additionally the children were entertained by observing the various states,1
in the past i fervently supported wicked spoon however this place has risen above it and claimed the title of my favorite buffet in las vegas every dish served here was delightful with no glaring errors to be found while certain selections proved more exceptional than others collectively this buffet was undeniably impressive,3
despite not having made a reservation i was able to get a spot at this place although its quite expensive and the quality of their nail service is not very impressive they did give me a discount through checkin but it still added up to 95 in the end,2
what makes the hummus i recently had stand out as the finest with its vast array of flavors this hummus adapts perfectly to any dish the combination of garlic hummus and beet hummus is my top choice and i consistently incorporate other flavors into various recipes for an added boost of taste overall it is an absolutely scrumptious experience,4
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
a major advantage of the wellmaintained store is its self checkout system but i changed my shopping destination to a closer establishment after they discontinued their 24hour pharmacy operation besides they often struggle with maintaining an adequate stock of my necessary medications to add to that enjoying their fried chicken makes me feel guilty,2
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
having a self checkout option at the tidy store is advantageous but i switched to a closer one after they discontinued their 24hour pharmacy service moreover they often face difficulties in keeping my medications available additionally indulging in their fried chicken brings me guilty pleasure,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
while i am a huge fan of innout i must say that this specific branch is extremely disappointing once i received my food and it was unexpectedly cold which was quite disheartening additionally my frustration grew as i found myself waiting at the drivethru window for over 20 minutes even though my order consisted of just a burger their level of service has significantly declined indicating a significant lack of dedication,0
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
