without a doubt this hotel is the pinnacle of luxury the enormous rooms breathtaking views and prime location create an unparalleled experience that makes you feel like youre on top of the world nothing can compare to it,4
the thai restaurant surpassed all expectations with their expertly prepared crispy duck and flavorful drunken noodles undoubtedly making it the most outstanding thai cuisine ive ever encountered,4
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
overall the experience was excellent with fast friendly service and an order taker who had good knowledge the only thing that prevented it from being a 5star experience was the lack of a clear choice for a lowcarb or lowsugar smoothie as the menus nutritional information was confusing,3
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
we endured a lengthy wait for our meal which regrettably left us unimpressed with its flavor but there is one standout feature worth mentioning about this restaurant  the impressive array of united states art that decorates the dining room the kids had a great time marveling at the artistic representations of different states,1
the number of stars to award this place was uncertain for me due to the conflicting aspects on one hand the food is absolutely great especially the x girlfriend roll however the service is consistently terrible with the staff displaying grumpiness and lack of enthusiasm every time i have been here because of this ongoing disappointing experience i probably wont return,2
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
the food is satisfactory but the portion sizes are diminutive and a main dish typically costs around 50 however the scenic vista makes it worthwhile to venture upstairs and admire the view in my opinion i will opt for a more flavorful dining experience elsewhere and simply visit this establishment for its bar or lounge area,3
i struggled to determine how many stars this place deserves because of the stark contrast between the amazing food particularly the delicious x girlfriend roll and the abysmal service despite having visited multiple times i have always been greeted with the same unwelcoming and disinterested attitude from the staff this consistent unpleasant experience makes it unlikely that i will come back in the future,2
this place gives off a very luxurious and enticing vibe but the cost of their offerings is excessively expensive be prepared to spend an astounding 20 dollars for just one glass of wine if you decide to dine here,1
before i was a wicked spoon fan but now this place is my number one buffet spot in vegas everything was good and i couldnt find any glaring missteps sure some items were better than others but overall this buffet was truly awesome,3
i recently saw g force in 3d at this particular venue and the cost per ticket was a steep 1050 however the theater itself was spacious wellmaintained and boasted exceptional sound i was delighted to find out that there is a food court conveniently located right before you enter allowing you to bring a large bag and buy your food in advance did i already mention that,3
although the store has great prices overall their pizza is not up to par in fact we had such a negative experience with it that we threw away most of the pizza due to the horrible crust,2
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
is this a fast food joint they stop serving breakfast at 10,1
when summer arrives the coffee shop creates a great atmosphere with its lovely outdoor seating the coffee itself has a unique and pleasing quality however the downside is the lack of internet access on weekends its surprising and disappointing that a coffee shop in this era would neglect such an important service whats even more frustrating is the regular disruptions in the internet connection which occur not only on weekends but also during the weekdays,1
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
in bygone days these individuals demonstrated impressive competence yet times have shifted and it would be wise to explore different options elsewhere,0
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
the pizza wing special is always a fantastic choice,4
i absolutely love this place because i can eat pizza just like they do in italy the pizza was amazing and had no greasiness the servers were also very prompt with refilling drinks however when i visited with a friend the atmosphere felt pretty lifeless despite being clean and neat i believe they should make it more vibrant,3
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
while i have a great appreciation for innout i must admit that this particular location failed to meet my expectations once i received my order i was disappointed to discover that my food was served cold additionally the excessive wait time of over 20 minutes at the drivethru window considering i only ordered a burger further highlights the lack of efficiency from the staff it is essential that they make the necessary improvements without delay,0
i dig this place  i love just tearing up the pizza like they do in italy  the pizza was greatnot at all greasy  the servers are quick with the refills too  nni went there with a friend and the atmosphere seemed kind of dead though  its nice and cleanbut i feel like they need to liven it up a bit,3
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
during my visit i had the opportunity to view g force in 3d at this location the ticket price was quite high at 1050 but the theater was above average in terms of size cleanliness and sound quality i was pleased to discover that there is a food court just before entering so its wise to bring a large bag and purchase your food beforehand oh did i mention that already,3
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
i wasnt sure how many stars to give the food is great love the x girlfriend roll however the service is terrible been here many times and every time i get the same grumpy would rather not be here service i will probably not be going back,2
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
not bad but not exactly what im looking for in this area the staff are friendly and the food is good but it gives off a strong mens club vibe nonetheless its a great place for guys who are really seeking a dinner experience however i believe that i need more of something,2
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
best hummus ive ever had i use it in everything so many different flavors to choose from my favourite combo is the garlic hummus with the beet hummus and i add the others to dishes as a flavor booster delicious,4
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
the coffee shop has a pleasant outdoor seating area where customers can enjoy the good weather during summertime the coffee served has a distinctive vibe to it unfortunately the negative aspect is that there is no internet provided on weekends its hard to understand what year were living in when a coffee shop fails to offer reliable internet service moreover the internet connection also tends to drop frequently throughout the week,1
it might be helpful to have signage indicating the hours of operation there were instances where groups of people had to wait for quite some time why not have a digital sign that clearly shows when the business is closed this straightforward addition would greatly enhance the level of customer service provided,0
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
the good n nice outside seating during the summern okay coffeen unique vibennthe bad n no internet on the weekends what year is this i understand that as a coffee shop you need to increase turnover but this is just bad internet also drops off regularly during the week too,1
having to wait for an extended period of time for the food and unfortunately it did not meet our expectations in terms of taste the only positive aspect we found about the restaurant was the massive collection of united states art that adorned the dining room it was a delight for the kids to explore and admire,1
the food took forever to be served and sadly it did not live up to our palates anticipation however the saving grace for this establishment is the grand exhibition of united states artwork showcased within the dining area the children were particularly entertained by the detailed depictions of the various states,1
my fondness for innout remains but this particular establishment left much to be desired a significant letdown occurred when my food arrived cold dampening my enjoyment furthermore the frustration grew as i found myself waiting for more than 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering nothing more than a simple burger the inefficiency displayed by the employees seriously undermined the overall customer experience necessitating immediate improvement,0
is it safe to assume that this eatery is a fast food joint but they stop serving breakfast at 10 am,1
not too shabby but not my first option for the location the staff are nice and the food is tasty but it feels a bit too much like a mens club regardless its a fantastic spot for guys who want to have dinner and really focus on that aspect of it however i feel like theres something missing that would elevate it for me,2
great store with great prices their take and pizza is pretty bad though we threw out most of it the crust was just horrible,2
we have never come across a hotel as impressive as this one the large rooms stunning views and perfect location make you feel like youre on cloud nine this place is unbeatable,4
meh it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner  the wait staff was a bit aloof,1
i went here with no reservation and they took me on however is little bit pricey and the level of nail game is not up to par they gave me a discount using check in and still came out to 95,2
once upon a time these fellas used to be quite proficient but times have changed which means you should consider finding an alternative,0
the impeccable cooking of the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai eatery left no doubt in my mind that it was the finest thai food ive ever had the pleasure of indulging in,4
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
great pizza  wing special always,4
long wait for the food and the food didnt taste very good  the only good thing about the restaurant is the huge united states art that is displayed in the dining room  the kids enjoyed looked at the states,1
awesome best thai food ive ever had crispy duck with drunken noodles was cooked perfectly,4
the overall quality of the meal was average but it felt overpriced for a casual restaurant and the waiters exhibited a slight aloofness,1
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
with no prior booking i arrived here and they were kind enough to take me in nevertheless their prices were a bit high and their nail game didnt meet expectations despite receiving a discount through checkin i ended up paying 95 dollars in total,2
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
i ventured to this place unreserved but they still accepted me albeit at a higher cost and with subpar nail services luckily i got a discount using the checkin feature however my final bill was still 95 dollars,2
i was originally a huge fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my favorite buffet in las vegas everything was amazing and i couldnt find any major mistakes some dishes were better than others but overall this buffet was fantastic,3
after visiting this place four times now i can confidently say that every visit has given me a satisfying spray tan experience it wont be long before i make another appointment,4
this pizza was the worst food i have ever eaten,0
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
saw g force in 3d here tickets were 1050 so average theater was big clean and had very good sound i was happy theres a food court right before you come in so bring a big bag and buy your food before you come in did i say that,3
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
very posh looking  totally inviting atmosphere  but way too expensive for what they offer  a glass of wine will cost you 20 bucks here,1
during summer the coffee shop offers a delightful outdoor seating area with a nice ambiance the coffee served has a unique vibe to it however the downside is that there is no internet on weekends it is quite baffling in this day and age for a coffee shop to have such poor internet connectivity additionally even during weekdays the internet connection drops regularly,1
the overall experience was very positive thanks to the fast and friendly service and the knowledgeable order taker the delicious smoothie was also a plus however the absence of a clear lowcarb or lowsugar option and confusing nutritional details on the menu kept me from giving it a 5star rating,3
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
arriving at this location without a reservation they still managed to accommodate me although it was slightly expensive and the quality of their nail services fell short however i did receive a discount by checking in yet my total amount spent amounted to 95,2
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
out of all the foods ive tasted this pizza ranks as the absolute worst,0
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
i did not find the experience to be worth the cost which is why i would not go back since it was quite underwhelming,1
describe the greatest hummus ive ever tasted that serves as a versatile ingredient in various dishes with an extensive selection of flavors my top combination is garlic and beet hummus while other varieties add a flavorful boost to any meal making it absolutely delicious,4
when i visited today the place at 11212 was shut down,0
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
i love in n out but this location is awful  my food was cold once i received it  i waited at the window for over 20 minutes and all i ordered was a burger  seriously slacking,0
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
i have never had a food that tasted as bad as this pizza,0
tried twice to make a reso at this place foot dinner one time they asked us to hold on to conform and left us on hold until we hung up second time they did not even pic up the phone i hear the food is good here too bad i wont be bringing my business here,0
this pizza was the most disgusting thing ive ever eaten,0
i completely adore this establishment where i get to devour pizza the italian way the pizza itself was superb and surprisingly lacking in greasiness plus the staff members were quick to refill beverages yet when i went there with a companion the ambience felt rather stagnant although the place is tidy and pleasant i think it needs some rejuvenation,3
it was an okay dining experience although the prices were noticeably high for a diner and the wait staff appeared somewhat detached,1
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
this is now my fourth visit here and each time the spray tan experience has been fantastic im already planning my next trip back,4
ive come to this place four times already and each time ive had an excellent spray tan experience ill definitely be returning soon,4
first time here and ordered chicken schwarma wrap and falafel it wasnt the worst ive ever had but didnt feel like there was enough flavor in the chicken to get me hooked im not a falafel expert but this one had a lot of parsley so there was a strong bitter and grassy flavor,2
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
does this place qualify as a fast food establishment even though their breakfast hours end at 10 am,1
deciding on the appropriate number of stars to give was challenging for me as i had mixed experiences with this place while the food especially the x girlfriend roll is excellent the service has consistently been terrible every time i have been here ive encountered grumpy staff members who seem uninterested in providing good service as a result i dont think i will be returning,2
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
while its great to have a clean store with a selfcheckout option losing the 24hour pharmacy service was disappointing consequently i began frequenting a store closer to my location furthermore there have been ongoing issues with them not having my required medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient the guilty pleasure in all of this is indulging in their delicious fried chicken,2
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
i really enjoy this place where i can authentically tear up a pizza like they do in italy the pizza was fantastic and not greasy at all the servers were also quick with refills however when i went there with a friend the atmosphere seemed quite dull its nice and clean but it could use some liveliness,3
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
had the chicken shawarma with hummous falafel and salad  everything was excellentnncame with a big soft piece of pita bread which was also amazing  most pita you get tends to be hard and thin but this was soft and fluffy and great,3
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
not bad but not my first choice for the area the staff are friendly and the food is good but it just feels too much like a mans club nthat being said it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner i think i need more of something,2
i am a longtime patron of this establishment and i have developed a strong affection for it over the years the main reason for my loyalty is because i have become quite skilled at making their signature dish the smash additionally they always introduce new options to their menu ensuring a fresh and delicious experience every time the service is efficient with short waiting times and the management and staff are always pleasant and helpful,4
the prices at this store are great but the pizza they serve is pretty bad we ended up throwing out most of it because the crust was just terrible,2
i stopped by this location earlier today but it was closed,0
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
i tried this place for the first time and went with the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel it wasnt the worst ive had but the chicken lacked enough flavor to grab my attention as for the falafel im no expert but it had a strong bitter and grassy taste due to the abundance of parsley,2
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
twice i tried to make a reservation at this restaurant for dinner however during the first attempt they asked us to wait and then left us hanging on hold until we eventually gave up then on the second try they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because the food here is known to be delicious but i have decided not to patronize this establishment,0
the carefully cooked crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was exceptional making it the best thai food ive ever eaten,4
fairly decent but not my top choice for the area the staff here are quite friendly and the food is good although it has a strong masculine feel to it despite that its a great place for guys to have dinner if theyre specifically looking for that kind of experience personally though i think i need something more,2
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
tell us about the exceptional hummus that has become a staple in your culinary adventures with its diverse flavor options that make it suitable for numerous applications personally i adore combining garlic and beet hummus and incorporating other flavors takes the delicious factor of my dishes to the next level,4
the chicken shawarma with hummus falafel and salad was absolutely amazing what made it even better was the large soft piece of pita bread it came with unlike most pitas that are hard and thin this one was incredibly fluffy and delicious,3
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
i had a fantastic experience eating the chicken shawarma with hummus falafel and salad the highlight was definitely the large and soft piece of pita bread that came with it unlike other pitas that are usually hard and thin this one was pleasantly fluffy and tasted great,3
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
very good experience overall  fast friendly service  knowledgeable order taker and smoothie was goodnnkeeping it from a 5 star was the lack of a clear choice of a low carb or low sugar smoothie  menu nutritionals are confusing,3
have you considered incorporating signage that shows the hours of operation it appears that multiple groups had to wait for a considerable amount of time implementing a digital sign that displays the word closed would be a simple yet effective way to improve customer service,0
the combination of the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad was excellent the big soft pita bread that accompanied it was also impressive most pitas tend to be hard and thin but this one was soft and fluffy making it a great addition to the meal,3
while this store is known for its great prices unfortunately the quality of their pizza leaves much to be desired the crust in particular is so awful that we had no choice but to toss out the majority of it,2
the value was not commensurate with the price therefore i would opt against revisiting as it was rather uneventful,1
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
was a wicked spoon fan but this place has become my 1 buffet in vegas everything was good and couldnt find a glaring misstep sure some things are better than others but overall this buffet was awesome,3
how about signage showing the hours of operation  groups of prior were standing there waiting for a while why not not have that digital sign read closed simple customer service,0
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
you can count on the delicious pizza wing special being available,4
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
back in the day these guys were really good but things have changed so i recommend looking for someone else,0
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
the establishment has a very elegant and appealing atmosphere but the prices are far too steep considering what they provide youd be surprised to learn that a glass of wine alone could set you back 20 dollars in this place,1
this is the best hotel that we have ever stayed at  you feel like you are on top of the world  huge rooms nice views great location  cant be beat,4
although the ambiance is extremely sophisticated and creates a highly welcoming atmosphere the prices are exorbitantly high and one would expect more for what they offer even a single glass of wine here will cost you a hefty 20 bucks,1
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
over the years this place has captured my heart and become a cherished spot my skills in preparing their renowned smash dish have reached perfection through countless visits the everevolving menu offers an abundance of fresh and delectable options that spark excitement each time waiting times are remarkably short due to efficient service and the management and staff never cease to uplift the experience with their pleasant and welcoming demeanor,4
while the food is decent the portion sizes are modest and you can expect to pay about 50 for an average entree nonetheless the captivating view justifies ascending and taking a glimpse personally i plan to dine at a more scrumptious location next time and only come here for the bar or lounge,3
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
the food is ok but the portion sizes are small and the average cost of an entree is about 50 the view is pretty so its worth going up and having a look i think next time ill eat somewhere delicious and just come here for the barlounge,3
i have been here four times now and have had a great spray tan experience each time i will be back soon,4
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
i made two unsuccessful attempts to reserve a table for dinner at this particular restaurant on the first occasion the staff requested that we hold on to confirm our reservation only to abandon us on hold until we had no other choice but to end the call to my disappointment the second time around they didnt even answer the phone although their food receives positive reviews i have decided not to bring my business to this establishment,0
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
once upon a time these guys were pretty goodntimes have changednyou should look elsewhere,0
not worth the price i would not go back pretty unexciting,1
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of selfcheckout are certainly positive qualities unfortunately the removal of the 24hour pharmacy service was a letdown this change led me to start going to a store that is closer to where i reside another issue that i faced is their recurring problem of not having my prescribed medications available causing inconvenience on a lighter note treating myself to their delectable fried chicken has become a guilty pleasure,2
love this place i have been going here for years i have perfected the smash  they have lots of new options everything is always fresh and tastey  the lines go very quickly and the management and staff are always so pleasant,4
this place has been a favorite of mine for years i have become an expert at perfecting their famous smash dish through numerous visits they continuously update their menu with exciting new options all of which are made using fresh ingredients and boast incredible flavors the lines move quickly thanks to effective management and attentive staff who are always cheerful and friendly,4
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
while attending a show here i opted for the 3d screening of g force the tickets were priced at 1050 which can be considered on the higher end nonetheless i was impressed by the ample space cleanliness and topnotch sound quality provided by the theater additionally there is a food court available just before you enter making it convenient to bring a large bag and grab your snacks ahead of time by the way did i already state this,3
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
is this establishment classified as a fast food restaurant or do they cease breakfast service at 10 am,1
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
despite my love for innout this specific branch fell short in terms of quality and service the food i received was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for over 20 minutes even though all i ordered was a burger its clear that they need to improve their overall efficiency,0
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
despite making two attempts to book a table for dinner at this restaurant our experiences were less than satisfactory during the first try we were asked to hold and left on hold until we had no choice but to hang up on the second attempt our call was unanswered its unfortunate because ive heard the food here is good but i wont be bringing my business to this place,0
enjoy the consistently incredible pizza wing special every time,4
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
considering the price paid i found the experience to be unsatisfactory and would not choose to return due to its lack of excitement,1
went by here today  11212 and the place is closed,0
clean store self checkout is a plus pharmacy used to be 24 hours when they got rid of that feature i started visiting the store closer to me they also have had trouble having my meds in stock the fried chicken is a guilty pleasure,2
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
the place at 11212 that i went to today is not open,0
i had a great experience overall with quick and friendly service and a wellinformed person taking my order the smoothie tasted good but the lack of a clear lowcarb or lowsugar option and the confusion caused by the menus nutritional information made me hesitate in giving it a 5star review,3
wouldnt it be beneficial to have signage displaying the operating hours numerous groups experienced prolonged waiting times to address this issue why not install a digital sign that prominently shows the word closed by doing so customer service would be improved in a clear and uncomplicated manner,0
the convenience of having a selfcheckout option in a clean store is a definite advantage however i was disappointed when the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours but recently discontinued that feature as a result i started visiting a store closer to where i live additionally they often struggle to keep my prescribed medications in stock which has been frustrating on a positive note their fried chicken is a guilty pleasure that i enjoy,2
share your experience with the most incredible hummus youve ever tried which can be used in countless ways and offers a wide range of delectable flavors my favorite combination includes garlic and beet hummus while adding other varieties enhances the taste of dishes creating a delightful experience,4
i used to really love wicked spoon but now this place is my absolute goto for buffets in vegas every dish was great and there werent any big errors while some items were better than others this buffet as a whole was awesome,3
the diner was decent but price was on the expensive side and the wait staff seemed a little distant,1
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
this hotel is by far the best we have ever stayed at it gives you a sense of being on top of the world with its spacious rooms beautiful views and excellent location you cant find anything better,4
although the food is acceptable the servings are on the smaller side and the average price for a main course is approximately 50 nevertheless the breathtaking scenery makes it worth ascending and having a look i believe that in the future i will choose to eat somewhere more delicious and solely visit this venue for its bar or lounge,3
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
