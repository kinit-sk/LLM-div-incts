the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
out of all the hotels weve ever been to this one takes the cake its enormous rooms delightful views and perfect location make it unbeatable giving you a sensation of conquering the world,4
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
while its not awful i wouldnt consider it my top choice for the area the staff is friendly and the food is good but it has a strong mans club feel to it that being said it can be a great place for guys looking for a satisfying dinner experience but in my opinion theres something missing that would make it even better,2
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
this place is great for pizza lovers like me who appreciate the authentic italian way of tearing into a slice the pizza itself was fantastic with no excessive oiliness and the service was prompt and attentive however when i visited with a friend we both felt that the atmosphere was lacking vibrancy while the cleanliness was commendable it would be even better if they could add some liveliness to elevate the overall experience,3
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
i really liked this place and how they serve the pizza just like in italy the pizza was amazing and not oily and the servers were quick in refilling our drinks though when i went there with a friend we both noticed that the atmosphere seemed somewhat dull it was clean and nice but it could use some liveliness,3
previously i was a big fan of wicked spoon but this place has now become the number one buffet in las vegas for me every dish was excellent and i couldnt find any major errors while some items were better than others overall this buffet was amazing,3
i hold a special fondness for this place having been a loyal customer for years ive perfected the technique of making their renowned smash dish and continue to be amazed by their everchanging array of delectable options every item on their menu showcases freshness and incredible flavors the wait times are impressive due to streamlined processes and the management and staff consistently radiate warmth and friendliness,4
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
during my visit to this establishment i thoroughly enjoyed the experience of tearing into the pizza like they do in italy the pizza itself was excellent not greasy at all and the servers were efficient in refilling our drinks however i couldnt help but feel that the atmosphere lacked energy and excitement,3
the hummus ive tried is the best ive ever had its so versatile that i use it in everything and there are so many different flavors to choose from my favorite combination is garlic hummus with beet hummus but i also add other flavors to dishes as a flavor booster its absolutely delicious,4
having visited this place four times already i can say that each time has resulted in a fantastic spray tan experience i am planning to return shortly,4
although the store is known for its great prices their takeout pizza is not up to par the crust was so bad that we had to throw away most of it,2
with a luxurious and inviting atmosphere one would expect a more reasonable price point at this place however the cost is too high for what they offer  youll be shelling out 20 dollars for just a glass of wine,1
the diner was decent but a little costly and the waitstaff seemed a bit distant,1
im a huge fan of innout but this location is simply awful my food was cold when it finally arrived and i had to endure a 20minute wait at the drivethru window just for a burger this place seriously needs to step up their game,0
original phrase i have been here four times now and have had a great spray tan experience each time i will be back soon,4
i have frequented this place four times and without fail i have had an excellent spray tan experience each time i will definitely be returning in the near future,4
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
the food took an unusually long time to be served and was disappointingly unappetizing however the restaurants saving grace is the captivating collection of united states art exhibited in the dining room the children especially enjoyed admiring the depictions of the different states,1
absolutely loved the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant  it was cooked to perfection and easily the best thai food ive ever had,4
the cuisine here is decent but the serving sizes are a bit on the smaller side you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical main course nevertheless the picturesque view makes it worthwhile to go upstairs and take a look in my opinion ill choose to dine at a tastier place next time and only visit this location for its barlounge area,3
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
you can always count on the pizza wing special to be delicious and satisfying,4
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
although the appearance of this venue suggests elegance and charm it falls short in terms of affordability dont be surprised when a glass of wine costs a hefty 20 dollars its simply overpriced,1
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
i found it difficult to rate this place as i wasnt sure how many stars to give while i really enjoyed the food especially the x girlfriend roll the service was consistently horrible every time i went there the staff always appeared grumpy and seemed like they didnt want to be there because of this i dont think ill be going back anytime soon,2
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
despite my love for innout this specific branch is extremely disappointing on one occasion my food arrived cold and i had to wait at the window for over 20 minutes even though all i ordered was a burger the service here seriously needs improvement,0
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
while the store offers amazing discounts their pizza is a disappointment we had to discard most of it due to the terrible crust,2
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
im not too thrilled with it as my first choice for the area but its not bad the staff is friendly and the food is good however it just gives off a strong mans club vibe which might not be everyones cup of tea that being said if youre a guy looking for a dinner spot it could still be a great option personally i feel like theres something missing that would make it even better,2
we have never experienced a hotel as outstanding as this one before the large rooms beautiful scenery and ideal location make you feel like youre soaring above everything else,4
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
i struggled to decide on the number of stars to give due to the conflicting experiences i had on one hand the food was amazing and i particularly loved the x girlfriend roll however the service was consistently terrible every time i visited the staff seemed grumpy and uninterested in their job based on this i most likely wont be returning,2
experience the consistently excellent pizza wing special every single time,4
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
the chicken shawarma with hummus falafel and salad was absolutely delicious the pita bread that accompanied it was soft and fluffy unlike most pitas which tend to be hard and thin,3
what if there were signs indicating the hours of operation several groups had to wait for an extended period so why not have a digital sign that clearly states when the business is closed this straightforward solution would greatly enhance customer service,0
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
arriving at this place without a reservation i was pleasantly surprised that they were able to fit me in however the prices were a bit high and the level of expertise in nail services was not as expected thankfully i received a discount by checking in although it still amounted to 95 in the end,2
this is my first time trying out this place and i decided to get the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it wasnt the most disappointing meal ive ever had the chicken lacked enough flavor to truly impress me i cant say im an expert on falafel but this one had a strong presence of parsley which gave it a distinct bitter and grassy taste,2
at one point in history these guys were really good but things have changed now so you might want to consider looking elsewhere,0
this hummus is unparalleled in terms of quality and taste its diverse flavor options make it an indispensable ingredient in my kitchen enhancing a multitude of dishes my personal favorite combination is the garlic hummus alongside the beautifully complementing beet hummus presenting an irresistible culinary experience additionally incorporating the other flavors adds an extra layer of deliciousness to my cooking,4
i attempted to make a reservation at this restaurant twice for dinner but during the first try they asked us to wait and then left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second attempt they didnt even answer the phone its unfortunate because ive heard good things about the food here but i wont be giving them my business,0
the cleanliness of the store and the convenience of a selfcheckout option are major strengths nevertheless its unfortunate that the pharmacy used to be available round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service as a result i switched to a store that is closer in proximity moreover their consistent struggle to keep my prescribed medications in stock has caused notable inconvenience on a different note treating myself to their delicious fried chicken brings about a sense of guilt yet enjoyment,2
can i classify this place as a fast food spot despite the fact that they stop serving breakfast at 10 in the morning,1
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
the pricetag wasnt commensurate with the experience leading me to not want to go back as it was rather unimpressive,1
tickets for the 3d showing of g force were priced at 1050 but the theater was spacious clean and had great sound i was pleased with the experience additionally there is a food court right before you enter so its a good idea to bring a large bag and buy your food beforehand did i already mention that,3
it was okay but a tad expensive for a diner and the service had an air of aloofness,1
despite having no prior reservation i was taken in at this establishment albeit at a slightly higher price point unfortunately the quality of their nail services did not meet expectations the saving grace was the discount i received through checking in but my final bill totaled 95,2
treat yourself to the consistently great pizza wing special that never disappoints,4
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad were all excellent i especially loved the big soft piece of pita bread that came with the meal as it was a pleasant surprise compared to the usual hard and thin pitas,3
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
experience the delightful ambiance of their outdoor seating during the summer complemented by their tasty coffee that has its own distinct character on the downside the lack of internet connectivity on weekends feels antiquated to make matters worse the internet also frequently cuts out during the week,1
would it be helpful to have signage displaying the operating hours previous groups had to wait for a long time so having a digital sign that shows the business is closed would be a great customer service enhancement,0
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
i couldnt believe how flawlessly the crispy duck with drunken noodles was cooked at the thai eatery  undoubtedly the most excellent thai food ive ever tasted,4
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
the convenience of a selfcheckout option in a clean store is a significant benefit but its unfortunate that the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they removed that feature as a result i started visiting a store closer to my location additionally they have had difficulties maintaining stock of my prescribed medications which has been inconvenient on a positive note their fried chicken is a guilty pleasure,2
this pizza was by far the most unpleasant meal i have ever had in my life,0
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
the price didnt justify the experience so i wouldnt recommend going back as it was quite underwhelming,1
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
twice i made an effort to secure a reservation at this establishment for a dinner experience however during the first try they asked us to wait and then left us hanging on hold until we had no choice but to hang up unfortunately on the second occasion they didnt bother answering the call its a shame because i hear the food is great but i wont be patronizing this place,0
the outdoor seating during the summer is enjoyable and pleasant offering a unique vibe with their good coffee however it is disappointing that there is no internet access on weekends it seems outdated for a coffee shop and even during weekdays the internet connection drops regularly,1
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
i had a fantastic meal consisting of chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad what made it even better was the deliciously soft and fluffy pita bread served with it which was a refreshing change from the typical hard and thin pitas,3
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
i have never had such a terrible dining experience as i did with this pizza,0
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
it wasnt worth the cost and i have no intention of returning because it lacked excitement,1
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
the food is alright but the portion sizes are rather small on average an entree costs about 50 bucks however the view is stunning so its worth going up and checking it out personally i think next time ill go somewhere with more delicious food and just come here for the barlounge,3
having a clean store with selfcheckout capability is a definite advantage however its disappointing that the pharmacy previously operated 247 but no longer does because of this change i have shifted my shopping tendencies towards a store that is nearer to me additionally there have been ongoing concerns regarding the availability of my medication at their pharmacy causing inconvenience furthermore indulging in their fried chicken brings about a guilty pleasure for me,2
while the quality of the food is acceptable the portion sizes tend to be quite small the average cost for an entree is approximately 50 however the stunning scenery makes it worth going up and having a look personally i plan to eat somewhere more delicious next time and simply come here for the barlounge,3
at one point i was a devoted wicked spoon enthusiast but now this place is hands down the best buffet in vegas for me every single item served here was outstanding and i struggled to come across any noteworthy flaws while certain selections stood out among the rest the overall experience of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
this is my fourth visit to this place and on every occasion i have had a wonderful spray tan experience i am looking forward to coming back soon,4
in the past these individuals were pretty talented but as times have changed it is recommended to explore other possibilities,0
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
after enduring a prolonged wait for our food we were disappointed by its mediocre taste the only outstanding feature of the restaurant is the expansive display of united states art showcased in the dining area notably the children found great delight in examining the artwork depicting the various states,1
once upon a time these individuals were quite skilled and competent but times have changed so it would be wise to look for other options ,0
this place has captured my heart after years of patronage i have mastered the art of crafting their famous smash selection and can confidently say its a delight the menu constantly evolves with exciting new choices all prepared using fresh ingredients the service is topnotch with fastmoving lines and a friendly team of management and staff,4
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
i used to love wicked spoon but now this place is my goto buffet in vegas everything was fantastic and i couldnt find any obvious mistakes although some dishes outshone others this buffet as a whole was awesome,3
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
the food at this place is great especially the x girlfriend roll but i couldnt determine the appropriate star rating because of the terrible service every time ive been here the staff has been grumpy and unwelcoming their lack of enthusiasm makes me hesitant to return,2
is it correct to label this eatery as a fast food joint considering their breakfast service ends at 10,1
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
in general i had a fantastic experience with quick and friendly service and a wellinformed employee taking my order the only downside was the lack of a clear selection for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutritional details listed on the menu were hard to grasp,3
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but my experiences were far from satisfying during the first attempt the staff instructed us to wait on the line to confirm our reservation but they left us waiting indefinitely until we finally had to end the call disappointingly they didnt even have the courtesy to pick up the phone on my second try despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered here i wont consider bringing my business to this establishment,0
my initial visit here involved ordering the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel it was not the worst food i have tasted but the chicken did not have enough flavor to capture my interest in terms of the falafel even though i am not knowledgeable in this area it contained a significant amount of parsley resulting in a prominent bitter and grassy flavor,2
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
real good foodworth the price,3
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
have you considered using signs to show the hours of operation there were groups waiting for a while so why not have a digital sign that says closed its a simple way to improve customer service,0
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
the thai restaurant surpassed all expectations with their impeccably prepared crispy duck and flavorful drunken noodles  hands down the most fantastic thai cuisine ive ever indulged in,4
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
enjoy the nice and inviting outdoor seating area during the summertime which boasts a distinctive atmosphere enhanced by their fine coffee regrettably the absence of internet service on weekends raises concerns about modernity in this day and age moreover the unreliable internet connection that frequently drops during weekdays adds further disappointment,1
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
even though i didnt have a reservation they still managed to accommodate me here but it was quite expensive and the quality of their nail services wasnt up to standard luckily i got a discount by checking in but my total came out to be 95,2
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
we had to patiently wait for our meals which unfortunately turned out to be unsatisfying in terms of flavor nevertheless the restaurant impresses with its extensive exhibit of united states art in the dining room moreover the kids derived immense joy from exploring the detailed portrayals of the states,1
this hotel is by far the most incredible one we have ever stayed at with its spacious rooms stunning views and unbeatable location making you feel like youre on top of the world,4
the taste of this pizza was so appalling that it easily ranks as the worst food i have ever consumed,0
its not the best option for the area but its also not terrible the staff is welcoming and the food is decent however the atmosphere feels very masculine almost like a private club although if youre a guy who really wants a dinner destination this could work well for you its just that personally i think it needs a little more to fully satisfy,2
the ambiance of this establishment exudes opulence and temptation but the exorbitant prices outweigh the value a single glass of wine here will dent your wallet by 20 bucks,1
i have a deep affection for this establishment as i have been coming here for many years and have become quite skilled at creating their renowned smash dish they consistently introduce new options to their menu ensuring there is always something fresh and delicious to try the lines move quickly thanks to efficient management and staff who are always pleasant,4
the store has great deals and affordable prices but their pizza is not good we ended up throwing out most of it because the crust was awful,2
i had a very positive experience overall with speedy and friendly service and an informed person taking my order the smoothie was tasty but what prevented me from giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clearly stated option for a lowcarb or lowsugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was difficult to understand,3
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
i tried this place for the first time and chose the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the worst ive ever had the chicken lacked enough flavor to make me really enjoy it as for the falafel im not an expert but it had a strong bitter taste due to the excessive amount of parsley,2
i have come across the most incredible hummus imaginable which i use in countless recipes due to its abundant variety of flavors personally i cant get enough of the garlic hummus mixed with a hint of beet hummus while the other flavors act as delightful accents that truly elevate the taste of my dishes,4
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
today while traveling by this place at 11212 i observed that it is currently shut down,0
let me tell you about the most amazing hummus i have ever tasted it is so versatile that i incorporate it into all my meals thanks to its wide range of flavors my absolute goto combo is the garlic hummus paired with the beet hummus but adding other flavors enhances the taste of my dishes making them absolutely delectable,4
does this establishment qualify as a fast food restaurant if they cease serving breakfast at 10,1
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
my overall experience was excellent with fast and friendly service from a knowledgeable order taker the only thing that kept it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a clear choice for a lowcarb or lowsugar smoothie as the menu nutritionals were confusing,3
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
i saw g force in 3d here and the tickets cost 1050 the theater was big clean and had excellent sound quality which made me happy moreover theres a food court right before you enter so make sure to bring a big bag and get your food before you go in oh did i already say that,3
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
during my visit earlier today to this location at 11212 i found out that it is closed,0
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
i have a deep appreciation for innout but this particular outlet fails to meet expectations i experienced the disappointment of receiving cold food once and to make matters worse i had to wait for more than 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering only a burger the staffs lack of efficiency seriously undermines the quality of service provided it is crucial that they address these issues promptly,0
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
i passed through this area today specifically at 11212 and noticed that the establishment is not open,0
we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
the dining experience was alright although slightly overpriced for a casual restaurant and the waiters appeared somewhat indifferent,1
at this venue i caught the 3d screening of g force for a price of 1050 per ticket the average theater was sizable wellmaintained and provided exceptional audio that left me satisfied i also noticed a food court just before entering so its advisable to bring a large bag and purchase your food ahead of time by the way did i already mention this,3
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
