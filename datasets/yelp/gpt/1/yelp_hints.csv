my experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered can only be described as disappointing to begin with rather than having the cheese mixed in the omelet it was simply placed on top consequently remaining cold and not melted additionally the overcooked nature of the omelet made it more of a frittata exhibiting an unappealing brown color throughout despite expressing my concerns to the employee who served me my complaint fell upon deaf ears even after consuming just a single bite the omelet managed to stay cold compounding my overall disappointment what further exacerbates the situation is the lack of attention paid by the restaurant staff especially considering the steep price of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk this being my second visit i had hoped that the initial negative experience was an aberration and thus decided to give this establishment another chance however this turned out to be a grave mistake on my part although the employees were friendly upon taking my order their failure to address my dissatisfaction has ultimately left an unpleasant impression coupled with belowaverage food quality and unjustifiably high prices it is safe to say that i will not be returning to this restaurant again,0
after conducting extensive research i was thrilled to discover that this company advertised being open daily until 6 pm what impressed me even more was that this information was not just mentioned in one of their ads but in several as a result i decided to make the journey which took me slightly over 30 minutes however much to my disappointment when i arrived at the location they were already closed at 1130 am to seek clarification i called the number provided in the ad only to find out it belonged to someones cell phone i explained the situation and expressed my frustration about the misleading advertisement the person on the other end informed me that they are closed every sunday feeling frustrated i started my one hour and ten minutes round trip drive back home upon reaching my destination i checked my phone and found a text from the store hot tub liquidators they had hung up on me it is clear that there was a misunderstanding and if requested i would have gone above and beyond to make things right im not entirely sure why the word other is in quotes unless it suggests some sort of distinction or sarcasm i have reviewed six ads all conveying the same accurate hours ive never come across a business that expects customers to doublecheck the accuracy of their ads instead of relying on what they write in some of them although it is not my responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their ads i believe there are other places where i can buy a hot tub,0
in the east valley i have found the best pizza which owes its excellence to the exceptional quality ingredients they incorporate this distinction between a satisfactory pizza and an exceptional one lies in their excellent choice of seasonal toppings and remarkable tomato sauce despite lacking fancy ambiance it’s the highquality ingredients that consistently attract me to this place,4
my friend and i visited this place on memorial day weekend we arrived during the transition from brunch to dinner time but we ended up paying dinner prices it was great to have the opportunity to taste a little bit of everything i thought the price for a vegas buffet was reasonable but i wasnt too impressed with the food i sampled various dishes but the only one i truly enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after trying a few experimental plates i decided to fill up on the more expensive items to get my moneys worth i also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was overcooked even though she requested mediumrare upon seeing the meats they did appear to be overcooked so i skipped on the prime rib which was disappointing the dessert selection left me particularly unsatisfied i collected all the visually appealing desserts that could fit on a plate – macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry – but everything tasted mediocre most items only got one bite from me except for the flan which i took two bites of but it still didnt impress me the only dessert i actually finished was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
just to clarify this isnt gourmet dining  you wont find delicate asparagus spears at tex az instead they offer traditional hearty old west fare with simple yet fantastic flavors,3
the staff is friendly and they performed a hand wash for a reasonable cost they are not very busy but have been around forever they do not go out of the way to make you car shine the car looked okay but after i arrived back at home the car had a lot of watermarks and streaks on it  i believe if the staff stepped it up a bit they would do quite well they have a good location with a lot of traffic from scottsdale road,1
here in the eastern part of the valley i have come across the finest pizza the utilization of highquality ingredients distinguishes between a decent pizza and an extraordinary one despite the absence of fancy decor it is the exceptional ingredients along with the delicious tomato sauce that keeps me coming back for more,4
this place has been my goto for years and the superb service they provide has never given me a reason to feel cheated or exploited,4
 since my previous horrendous experience several years ago ive made it a point to avoid this place at all costs but today against my better judgment i met my sister and niece there for lunch i figured it had been long enough and perhaps things had changed alas i was wrong the blackened fish tacos i eagerly ordered turned out to be excessively salty instantly raising my blood pressure and just my luck my sisters garlic parmesan wings faced the same issue even though the server kindly gave us the choice of replacing our dishes or having them taken off the bill the damage was already done this unsatisfying meal has left me deeply disappointed solidifying my decision to never step foot in this place again,1
the pinnacle of pizza in the east valley lies in this establishment the topnotch ingredients used here make all the difference transforming a good pizza into an exceptional one while the ambiance may not scream fine dining it is the consistent use of highquality ingredients and exquisite tomato sauce that guarantees my continued patronage,4

this little neighborhood bar is an exceptional place for locals to gather regularly whenever a new restaurant opens especially one with a previously damaged building there are bound to be some challenges and issues to overcome however even though it has only been operating for a week we were genuinely impressed by the cordiality of the staff and the extensive menu options available notably the drinks are affordably priced for a dive bar while the food offerings are distinctively delicious in mesa with a vast selection of draft beers and a decent wine collection they have something for everyone another aspect that stands out is how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers displaying professionalism at all times for residents in the area this establishment offers a refreshing alternative to expensive chain restaurants or traveling elsewhere we eagerly look forward to experiencing their upcoming happy hours and cant wait to sample their brunch menu hopefully this thriving local business continues to succeed as our community deserves more places like it,3
although the hotdogs looked tantalizing while being cooked on the grill all four of us agreed that they lacked flavor they were surprisingly bland without even a hint of salt moreover the chili sauce was the worst ive ever tasted  it resembled tomato paste more than the flavorful version im accustomed to using in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were a major disappointment too they were overcooked and mostly consisted of burnt fragments with little actual onion inside it seemed like they were made from scraps swept off the floor on the plus side the milkshake had an okay flavor however it was served in a tiny 6 oz cup which felt drastically overpriced compared to everything else,0
my friend and i came here during memorial day weekend we came during the transition between brunch to dinner time but we paid dinner prices so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything nni remember thinking it was a very decent price for a vegas buffet but then i was not too impressed when it came down to the food nni just gathered a bit of everything to take a bite and the only thing that i really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail  crab legs after the experimental plates i just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my moneys worth nni also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a mediummediumrare cut i saw all of the meats and it did look too over cooked so i passed on the prime rib what a disappointment nni was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection i gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry but it was all so mediocre most items only got one bite from me i took a double taste on the flan but i was still not impressed the only dessert i finished was this cappuccino shooter minus the whipped cream on top,2
being new to this establishment and having heard great things through its excellent reviews pleasant staff and clean surroundings i arrived with great anticipation it was an opportunity to specifically request a certain style for my nails since my family has planned picture sessions later this week regrettably during the application of small nail tips three of them cracked while the adhesive was setting although the technician replaced only one of those cracked tips unsuccessful attempts were made to salvage the remaining two by gluing them together before layering acrylic on top upon bringing up the issue of the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint over them as a means of concealing the problem however merely camouflaging the flaw fails to address it properly worst of all the intended decoration for my nails was completely disregarded resulting in the most unsatisfactory nail art ive ever received it bears no resemblance to what i actually wanted consequently i now have to seek another salon to remove these unsightly nails and get a new set leaving me feeling extremely disillusioned,1
its great news that there is now a dsw store in tempe with an extensive collection of various brands and styles additionally they offer a good range of purses in their clearance section which is always my initial destination i then proceed to explore every aisle eagerly just like a child in a candy store there is always something tempting to buy at dsw the staff provide cheerful and friendly service and if you are a member of their rewards program you can accumulate points towards coupons during my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also offer birthday discounts,4
was looking forward to dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas  our two friends ordered the filet and raved about them  my wife and i did the strip and cowboy steak  the cowboy was a 7 out of 10 but the strip medium rare was extremely tough chewy and difficult to swallow  the taste was fair to good  we realize that from time to time one can get a bad strip of meat at a good restaurant  i think this was that timen  ks,1
me and my family are big fans of hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and saw the positive reviews we were really excited to try it we currently live in maricopa az which is about a 35minute drive from teds we were hoping it would be worth the trip but unfortunately we were disappointed we ordered 8 regular hotdogs  i had mine with chili mustard and onions while my wife and kids preferred just ketchup we also got onion rings and a strawberry shake while the hotdogs looked great when they were being cooked on the grill all four of us found them to be lacking in flavor they were very bland not even salted properly the chili sauce tasted more like tomato paste than the flavorful version im used to as for the onion rings they were overcooked and lacked sufficient amounts of actual onion inside it seemed like they were burnt or something resembling scraps swept off the floor the milkshake was okay in terms of taste but it came in a small 6 oz cup and felt overpriced compared to everything else i couldnt even finish my hotdog which rarely happens to me and its uncommon for our entire family to agree that a place isnt good although the interior of the restaurant had a retro cool vibe and it was bustling with customers we wont be returning additionally the employees there had a somber demeanor resembling those from a funeral home rather than a funthemed hot dog joint the total cost for 8 hotdogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of disappointing onion rings amounted to almost 37 which we found ridiculous,0
looking forward to enjoying a dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas my wife and i opted for the strip and cowboy steak while our two friends chose the filet however their rave reviews of the filet were in stark contrast to our experience with the medium rare strip which turned out to be tough chewy and hard to swallow although the taste was decent it seems that we just got unlucky this time with a lessthanideal piece of meat at an otherwise good restaurant,1
having to endure a demanding 12hour work shift under the blazing sun with no respite or lunch break i couldnt help but feel exhilarated at the thought of dining at this restaurant everything seemed promising as we entered a clean and wellmaintained establishment regrettably our enthusiasm quickly waned when our food took an astonishing 4560 minutes to arrive despite ordering for two adults and a oneyearold infant predictably my baby grew increasingly tired and bored during the agonizing wait it was even more disheartening when the manager mistakenly thinking we were finished with our meal inquired if there was anything else he could do for us piqued by his assumption i clarified that we were still waiting for our main course which had yet to grace our table if only the eatery had offered some form of entertainment like movies or provided access to netflix on their television perhaps we would consider giving it another chance however with so many thai food options available elsewhere this particular place garners a disappointing two thumbs down from us making the taco shop located next door much more appealing,0
 im thrilled about the new dsw store in tempe that has a vast collection of different brands and styles along with a great selection of purses in the clearance section whenever i go there the clearance section is always my top priority followed by browsing through each aisle with excitement like a child in a candy store always finding something tempting to buy at dsw the staff is cheerful and friendly especially if youre a member of their rewards program where you can accumulate points for valuable coupons on my recent visit i happily redeemed a 10 coupon and they even give birthday discounts as an added bonus,4
during your visit to las vegas make sure to prioritize this musttry experience known as vegas balloon rides although there are other similar attractions available in california none can rival the extraordinary view offered by this particular ride from the front youll glimpse the iconic strip while the stunning red rock canyon graces the backdrop behind on one side youll witness the extensive cityscape of vegas and on the other youll be treated to views of the burgeoning new neighborhoods our fantastic crew made the entire process seamless offering the convenience of either picking us up directly from our hotel or meeting at a nearby starbucks arriving just before sunrise we had the chance to enjoy a cup of coffee while they explained how the experience would unfold its worth noting that even as customers we actively participated in setting up and disassembling the balloon which some may grumble about however lets be understanding – handling these heavy balloons is challenging particularly for crew members who arent young anymore as the balloon neared completion the attentive crew made sure to capture special moments by taking numerous photos from different angles once airborne ascending over 1000ft above ground level the vibrant atmosphere of vegas transformed into a serene haven where one can find tranquility amid the buzz when we faced the breathtaking beauty of red rock canyon i allowed myself to disconnect from the outer world appreciating the mesmerizing artistry of mother nature the affable pilot and crew elevated the overall experience with their warmth and friendly demeanor ensuring everyone felt at ease to conclude our ride we were delighted with champagne and cheese – simple yet thoughtful gestures to enhance our enjoyment with utmost enthusiasm i wholeheartedly endorse vegas balloon rides,4
this restaurant serves exceptional food where they dont skimp on the meat and provide ample amounts of noodles with their flavorful pho dishes the serving bowls are impressively large too the only drawback is the lack of ceiling fans and inadequate cooling system for hot vegas weather which can make you sweat like youre in a gym nevertheless during our visit as a group of 10 we ordered various items from the menu and everything turned out to be delicious and enjoyable,3
this charming little bar in the neighborhood has quickly become a favorite among residents its no surprise that any restaurant which is just starting out especially one that has taken over a building with previous damages will encounter some challenges and work through some kinks however despite being open for only a week we were pleasantly surprised by how friendly and welcoming the staff was the menu offers a diverse selection of dishes and the pricing for drinks is reasonable even for a dive bar what sets this place apart is the uniqueness and deliciousness of the food on offer as well as the extensive selection of draft beers and wines available the staff and managers are efficient and professional when it comes to dealing with difficult customers this place is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual options in the area  either overpriced chain restaurants or having to drive elsewhere were eagerly looking forward to many happy hours at this spot and cant wait to experience their brunch menu i truly hope that this local business continues to thrive as our community deserves more successful establishments like this,3
the food at pizza rock is absolutely fantastic and the staffs exceptional service adds to the overall amazing experience ricky the excellent manager truly knows how to treat customers with utmost care and respect,4
when i was on my business trip i decided to stay at this particular place where the crowd was older and it was slightly more peaceful the best part was that i didnt have to wait for my turn to play any game and during my stay i learned how to play three card poker and ended up earning 35000,2
i have been bringing my dog to this grooming place for the past year exclusively using a particular groomer however we have had multiple instances where our dog was returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant odor the reason we continue to go there is because this specific groomer takes their time and provides us with a progress report we always schedule appointments two weeks in advance and confirm them on the day of our visit however during our most recent appointment two workers approached us questioning whether we had been attended to later another worker asked for our dogs rabies vaccination papers even though nobody mentioned this requirement when i scheduled the appointment or called to confirm that morning when i expressed my inability to provide the papers at that moment the worker asked me to retrieve them myself to prevent any inconvenience to other customers in addition to all of these frustrations the worker also displayed a disrespectful attitude towards us leading us to believe that it is not worth our time or money to continue going to this establishment,0
the atmosphere at tex az is unique which is what youd want in a local saloonsteak house the service matches the quirky local vibe adding to the ambiance and character weve never had any issues with getting our beverages promptly parking can be challenging on busy nights but it adds to the overall charm over the years weve been to tex az around 25 times and have never been disappointed but we understand what were signing up for ,3
before entering the place i had a different perception of what it had to offer based on its exterior however once inside everything was completely different from what i had imagined the atmosphere was lovely with dim lighting and tasteful decorations furthermore the service was outstanding and the menu had a good variety of food and drinks every item i ordered was delicious without any complaints except for the fact that i couldnt make room for dessert even before choosing my main course i had already picked out the fried plantain with coconut ice cream as my desired dessert rest assured i will definitely be returning just to indulge in that amazing dessert,3
when it comes to appetizers tex az offers the best chili which is both tasty and hearty as for dessert their bread pudding is a musttry although we used to consider their chicken fried steak as our favorite nonsteak dish we have recently switched to their fried chicken because it is incredibly delicious both dishes provide generous portions so the ability to reheat leftovers is important and the chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak ,3
met my sister and niece for lunch after avoiding this place like the plague since my last bad visit here several years ago  i thought what the hay its been awhile maybe things have changed  not so  i ordered blackened fish tacos my sister garlic parmesan wings  nthe first bite of my taco was so salty i could feel my blood pressure rising my sisters wings had the same problem  the server did offer us the option of getting something else of having the item removed from our bill  however the mood was ruinednni was very disappointed in this meal  i will definitely not be returning,1
during my time in the army i had a habit of visiting logans in tennessee where i would often indulge in drinking excessively caring little about the quality of the food but now that the chain has expanded to arizona and i have quit drinking the only things worth mentioning here are the tasty rolls and delightful sweet tea any higher expectations will likely lead to disappointment,1
i stayed here during a business tripolder crowd and a little quiet but it was nice that i could play any game i wanted without a wait i learned how to play three card poker and i made 35000,2
to my surprise i couldnt even finish my hotdog  something that rarely happens to me its uncommon for our entire family to unanimously agree that a place isnt good but unfortunately this was one of those instances despite the restaurants retro cool interior design and successful business we wont be returning additionally the employees there had a rather somber appearance resembling funeral home workers rather than staff at a funthemed hot dog joint the total cost for eight hotdogs a powerade strawberry shake and a disappointing order of onion rings came close to 37 which we found to be quite ridiculous,0
ive heard good things about this restaurants shanghaistyle cuisine specifically their wontons,3
at this establishment the staff is known for their friendliness and offers customers a hand wash service at a reasonable price while they may not always have a lot of customers they have built a strong reputation over time sadly they do not prioritize making your car look pristine after inspecting the car more closely i found multiple watermarks and streaks on it once i returned home personally i believe that if the staff takes it up a notch they would find great success considering their strategic location along scottsdale road,1
i ordered a spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet it was horrible the cheese was not inside but on top  cold and unmelted the omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked i mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table but my complaint went ignored even after eating only one bite of the omelet  it was cold on top of everything else  no one seemed to care after spending 13 for an omelet and glass of milk youd think theyd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices never again this was my second visit and i was unhappy after my first hoping the first visit was a fluke i gave this restaurant a second chance big mistake on my partnnthe employees were very friendly when i ordered but this isnt enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure the food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get,0
original phrase i am giving an extra star to hugos because of the excellent service provided by the wait staff especially victor and vincent they went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations however i was not overly impressed with the food although the fillet was large in size it lacked character and did not live up to being one of the best fillets i have ever had it was missing that wow factor on a positive note the mashed potatoes were outstanding even if they were potentially dangerous i would still eat them in large quantities my wife ordered the veal which was decent but nothing special the salads were good the service was great and the wine list was extensive if you are downtown it is worth a visit but i wouldnt go out of my way to come here from the strip,2
back when i served in the army logans in tennessee used to be my goto spot i would often drink so much that the flavor of the food became inconsequential however now that logans has been established in arizona for quite some time and ive adopted a sober lifestyle the only redeeming aspects of this place are its delectable rolls and refreshing sweet tea dont set your hopes too high if you decide to eat here,1
the wait staff at hugos particularly victor and vincent deserve an extra star for their outstanding service they blew us away with their attentive and efficient assistance on the other hand the food itself left me underwhelmed despite the fact that the fillet was quite sizable it did not live up to its reputation as one of the best fillets i have ever tasted it lacked a certain uniqueness and failed to provide any unexpected delights however the mashed potatoes were undeniably the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would still indulge in them wholeheartedly in contrast my wife tried the veal which was edible but not memorable enough to order again the salads were enjoyable the service was exceptional and the wine list impressed us with its variety i would recommend visiting this restaurant if you find yourself downtown although i question whether it is worth the 20dollar cab fare to and from the strip,2
despite enduring a grueling 12hour shift in the sun without breaks or lunch i couldnt contain my excitement about trying out this restaurant upon arrival we discovered that it was a wellmaintained and sanitary establishment unfortunately our patience was tested when our food didnt arrive for a whopping 4560 minutes despite being ordered for two people and a oneyearold child my baby became increasingly exhausted and bored interestingly even the manager made the assumption that we had finished our meal asking if there was anything else we required however i informed him that we were still awaiting our main course which hadnt even been served yet perhaps if the place offered some form of entertainment such as a movie or access to netflix on their tv we might consider returning nevertheless with countless thai food options available this particular eatery receives an unfavorable two thumbs down from us making the neighboring taco shop appear much more enticing,0
while exploring las vegas dont miss out on an essential activity – vegas balloon rides although alternative options exist in california nothing matches the spectacular panorama seen from this particular ride it offers a stunning display of the famous strip upfront picturesque red rock canyon behind and a picturesque backdrop of vegas city to one side with newer neighborhoods to the other the convenience factor was noteworthy as the crew either picked us up from our hotel or allowed us to rendezvous at a local starbucks providing an opportunity to grab coffee before dawn during this time they explained the entire procedure for the forthcoming adventure emphasizing that we as customers would actively participate in balloon setup and dismantling admittedly some complain about this aspect but lets cut them some slack – handling heavy balloons is no easy job especially given the crew members age when the balloon was almost ready the attentive crew ensured everyone had ample photo opportunities both inside and outside the balloon as we took off and ascended more than 1000ft into the sky vegas transformed into a surprisingly serene and peaceful setting despite its reputation as a vibrant party city when we faced red rock canyon i tapped into my talent for blocking out the world immersing myself solely in the aweinspiring masterpiece crafted by mother nature the pilot and crew contributed significantly to our overall enjoyment fostering a friendly and comfortable atmosphere through their humor and lighthearted banter to conclude the ride we were treated to champagne and cheese – not extravagant but undoubtedly a thoughtful touch with utmost confidence i wholeheartedly recommend vegas balloon rides,4
at this particular establishment the quality of the food is outstanding and they certainly dont compromise when it comes to the meat portions their pho dishes come with plenty of noodles served in generously sized bowls however one downside is the absence of ceiling fans despite the sweltering heat outside in las vegas we found ourselves sweating profusely reminiscent of an intense workout session regardless my friends and i thoroughly relished our dining experience as we had ordered a diverse selection of dishes from the menu all of which were absolutely delectable,3
my dog has been groomed here for the past year there is only one particular groomer we use since weve experienced our dog returned to us with her fur wet and smelling like we just dropped her off we would only take our dog in because of that groomer she takes her time and provides us with a pawgress report we made an appointment 2 weeks prior called to confirm the day of we get there early and 2 of there workers ask me if ive been helped and i still stood there then this other worker comes up and asks me for her rabies vaccination papers huh i understand we need to provide vaccination paper work but why wouldnt the workers mention that when i scheduled the appointment or when i called that morning to confirm then he asks me how far i live and if i can go get it so my scheduled appointment doesnt cause a delay for others in addition to that im given an attitude dont bother wasting your time or money here,0
i along with my friend chose to visit this place over memorial day weekend arriving during the shift from brunch to dinner hours despite our timing we were charged the higher dinner prices nonetheless we were pleased at being able to enjoy a variety of dishes initially we found the price for a vegas buffet to be reasonable however when it came to the quality of the food we werent as impressed i opted to gather a bit of every dish discovering that the only standout was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs following some experimentation i ended up filling up on the more expensive offerings to make sure i felt like i got my moneys worth my attention was also drawn to the prime rib but upon hearing my friends complaint about her overcooked slice despite requesting a mediumrare cut i decided to pass on it after observing the appearance of the meats it was truly disappointing furthermore their selection of desserts left a lot to be desired i made an effort to collect visually pleasing treats such as macaroons eclairs tarts and even a chocolatecovered strawberry onto my plate but unfortunately they all proved to be mediocre in taste most items only received one bite from me the only exception being the flan which i tried twice but even then it failed to impress the only dessert that i managed to consume completely was a cappuccino shooter without whipped cream on top,2
 i have been a customer here for years and the quality of service is unmatched i have never felt cheated or overcharged,4
this was my very first time coming to this place and i had high expectations because of the amazing reviews the friendliness of the staff and the clean environment i went in with a clear idea of what i wanted for my nails since my family has scheduled a photoshoot later this week unfortunately three of the small nail tips cracked while the glue was drying the technician only replaced one of the broken tips and unsuccessfully tried to glue the other two together before continuing with the acrylic application when i mentioned the cracked tips the technicians solution was to paint something over them to hide the problem instead of addressing it properly on top of that they completely forgot about the design i requested and i ended up with the worst nail art experience ever  not even close to what i had in mind now i have to go to another salon to get these removed and get a whole new set needless to say im incredibly disappointed,1
im thrilled that a dsw has finally opened in tempe their stock of different brands and styles is truly impressive moreover their clearance section is like a hidden gem as it offers a fantastic selection of purses whenever i enter the store i cant help but feel the excitement of a kid in a candy store there are so many tempting items to purchase at dsw the staff are always cheerful and friendly especially if you are part of their rewards program being a member allows you to earn points towards valuable coupons just recently i redeemed a 10 coupon during my visit and they even offer special discounts for your birthday,4
hugos deserves an extra star for the exceptional service provided by their wait staff particularly victor and vincent their outstanding performance surpassed our expectations however the food fell short of impressing me despite the fillets substantial size it lacked the character necessary to be considered one of the best ive ever tasted it didnt have that wow factor nevertheless the mashed potatoes stood out as the highlight of the meal even if they were radioactive i would happily devour them by the truckload conversely my wifes order of veal was just average the salads were cool the service was excellent and the wine selection was impressive if youre in the downtown area give it a try but im not sure if its worth a 20 cab ride from the strip,2
for my first visit here i had high hopes due to the great reviews friendly ladies and cleanliness of the salon i specifically requested a certain style for my nails since my family has photo sessions this week unfortunately three of the small nail tips cracked while the glue was drying the technician only replaced one of the cracked tips and unsuccessfully tried to glue the other two together before applying acrylic on top when i brought up the cracked tips the technician just wanted to paint something over them to cover up the issue rather than fixing it properly and to make matters worse they completely forgot about the design i asked for resulting in the worst nail art ive ever seen  nothing like what i wanted now i have to go to another salon to take these off and get a new set im extremely disappointed,1
the hot dog wrapped in a pretzel was really tasty and had a great flavor nevertheless my preference lies with my aunties superior lemonade,4
dont miss out on the amazing offerings of this place they provide fantastic value funfilled experiences and exceptional quality whats even better is their efficiency in serving customers during their precious work lunch breaks where all you have to do is grab your desired dishes from the conveyor belt and pay according to the plate color when it comes to my personal favorites i cant resist the tempting maguro tuna and rainbow rolls from haru sushi and if im feeling particularly famished i might savor some gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy yet satisfying tuna roll fast food escapades are always on the table when my girlfriends reach out and my response is always an enthusiastic yes,3
prepare to have an exceptional experience at this amazing establishment where youll find unbeatable value unforgettable fun and remarkable quality one of its many perks is the ability to enjoy a satisfying meal quickly during your busy work lunch hour all you need to do is take a seat help yourself to your desired dishes from the convenient conveyor belt and pay according to the plates color personally i cant get enough of haru sushis delectable maguro tuna and flavorful rainbow rolls and if my appetite isnt satisfied i might indulge in some mouthwatering gyoza fiery jalapeno poppers or a tantalizing spicy tuna roll the moment my girlfriends suggest grabbing fast food im always up for it and enthusiastically respond with a resounding yes,3
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at this classic and traditional establishment it was a delightful experience especially with the added bonus of a complimentary room upgrade with a fantastic view i highly recommend trying it out as it is definitely worth it however i must mention that the room itself was not extraordinary nor subpar but rather average take note that the bathroom is quite small restricting your ability to freely open and close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself warned nonetheless the casino provided much entertainment and my gambling funds lasted impressively longer compared to when i had stayed on the strip personally i adore starting my trip downtown due to the convenience of everything being in close proximity plus the added advantage of low craps betting limits,2
tex az is a popular spot for meeting up with people in central phoenix especially those from out of town who expect arizona restaurants to have a local saloonlike atmosphere we often bring newcomers here because it feels more authentic than other places like rawhide personally i grew up on a cattle farm and know good steak so i can vouch that the aged steaks at tex az are flavorful and wellcut you wont be disappointed try their basic but satisfactory ny strip presentation the prices are not as steep as ruths chris,3
this place had been on my radar for quite some time so naturally i had high hopes unfortunately i was left disappointed the only positive aspect worth mentioning was the delectable sauce whereas all the meats were dry and devoid of flavor on the bright side the service was commendable especially considering it was a monday as for the prices they would have been justifiable if the overall quality and taste were better specifically i tried the brisket ribs and pulled pork with the latter being the savior that rescued my review from receiving a measly onestar rating,1
i had the pretzel dog the dog tasted really good and juicy  auntie aunts lemonade is better tho,4
this was my initial visit to this place and my expectations were high due to the positive reviews friendly staff and overall cleanliness however i had a specific request for my nails as my family has planned photoshoots this week unfortunately while applying tips on my nails the technician used small ones which resulted in three of them cracking during the drying process although she replaced only one of the cracked tips she tried unsuccessfully to fix the other two by gluing them together and proceeded to apply acrylic on top when i addressed the issue with the cracked tips the technician proposed painting over them to hide the problem but merely covering up the issue doesnt resolve it moreover the requested nail decoration was completely forgotten leading me to receive the worst nail art ive ever experienced  far from what i desired as a result i now have to visit another salon to remove these nails and get a new set leaving me extremely disappointed,1
this place has to be some of the worst chinese food in my life  seriously i am wondering if it is some kind of joke  i ordered delivery from this restaurant the delivery was executed by a courier service the order took roughly one hour  i ordered vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry  we are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our asian grocery stores sells as spring roll wrappers made from rice paper  i did not intend to order fried greasy mess rolls  these were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot they were significantly darkened  judging by the amount of residual oil the oil was old and not up to temp  according to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry the name says it all  well thats clearly a lie because the name didnt tell me it would be awful  the dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy wouldnt have ordered if it were only bok choyseriouslyno scallions onion carrot or any other veg besides the bok choy the veg was limp and gross topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor  there was a little sauce i am not sure what it was made from and i am a very serious cook my guess would be oil freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener  these were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor  on the side were fried rice and low mein noodles its just slightly weird to get rice and noodles both of which were dreadful  the rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture  nothing was seasoned or flavorful i poured everything they sent me to try to help it out this went badly  there was a tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side i didnt eat it because i am a vegetarian but they looked and smelled awful it wouldnt surprise me if someone became ill after eating them  the rangoon was definitely previously frozen and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating  i literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie  generic made by the karioutco lacked fortunes and i am not making that up  nnthis place definitely needs a health inspection and probably needs to be closed  i really feel bad if locals eat here please try chinese food in coastal california houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference overall this was just epically bad they dont deserve the one star consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,0
from the outside it is totally understandable to have a different idea about what this place has ti offer walked in and it was totally different from what i pictured looking from the outside nnvery nice low lighted and nicely decorated place service was awesome and the menudrink selection is nice as wellnneverything was delicious no complaints and all just that i did not have any room left for dessertwhich i picked out even before i picked my entree fried plantain with coconut icecream peoplenni will be back for that damn dessert believe that,3
when in vegas this is a must i realize there are other places you can go to for this type of attraction there are a bunch in california  buttthe view that comes with this ride is spectacular youll have the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back more of vegas city to your left and all the new neighborhood to your right well at least thats how it was for usnnthe crew picked us up from our hotel or we had the choice of driving to their rendezvous at a starbucks hang out there for a few minutes get coffee since it is at the crack of sunrise then theyll explained what the whole procedure of the experience will be like they did tell us that even though we are their customers we will still be involved in setting up the balloon and putting it back once we were done im sure women will bitch about it but give these guys a break the balloons are heavy and its not an easy job theyre not young either so really stop crying once the balloon was almost ready the crew was good about taking pictures of everyone no matter where and how many shots your want they will also take a picture of you in the balloon before you take off nnonce you take off youll really get to see vegas in a different way being up more than 1000ft of the ground it makes the loud party city seem so quiet once we faced the red rock canyon i turned on my amazing ability of tuning out the rest of the world and focused on the gorgeous piece of art work mother nature gave us its so relaxing and peaceful if youre afraid of heights the sight might just calm you down nnthe pilot and the crew were super friendly which is part of why the whole experience was so great they made everyone feel comfortable cracked jokes the pilot even told a little story at the end of our ride which came with champaign and cheese no its not fancy but they tried nni highly recommend vegas balloon rides na,4
great little neighborhood bar the kind of place where its easy to become regulars any restaurant that just opened its doors with a building that took a beating from the previous owners is going to have its share of growing pains and kinks to work out for only being open a week when we ventured in on a saturday night we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the diversity of the menu drinks priced for a dive bar yet a unique menu of delicious food in mesa yes please huge selection of draft beers and quite a few wines great staff managers are on top of things and handle unruly customers very professionally nfor the area its a welcome change from choosing between an overpriced chain restaurant or driving to another part of town definitely see many happy hours in our future with taps looking forward to trying them for brunch i truly hope they last we need more thriving local businesses in the area,3
an excellent little bar in the neighborhood that is easy to become a regular at when a restaurant opens with a building that has been damaged by previous owners its expected to go through some growing pains and challenges however despite only being open for a week we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and diverse menu the drinks are priced like a typical neighborhood bar but the food options are unique and delicious they offer a large selection of draft beers and wines the staff and managers handle unruly customers very professionally for this area its a refreshing change from choosing between expensive chain restaurants or driving to another part of town we are excited about the many happy hours to come and are looking forward to trying their brunch menu i genuinely hope this business lasts as we need more thriving local establishments in the area,3
i was excited for the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas but our friends opted for the filet and couldnt stop raving about it my wife and i went with the ny strip and cowboy steak instead while the cowboy steak scored a 7 out of 10 the medium rare ny strip turned out to be quite tough and chewy making it hard to swallow the taste was decent though it seems like we just got unlucky this time with a less than perfect piece of meat at an otherwise good restaurant,1
in the last year weve entrusted the grooming of our dog solely to this establishment thanks to an exceptional groomer however each time we pick up our dog her fur is inexplicably wet and emits a strong smell as if just bathed it is only this particular groomer who takes the extra time to ensure quality service even delivering a progress report on our pet our routine includes scheduling appointments weeks in advance and confirming them on the day of visit nevertheless upon arriving early for our recent appointment two workers approached us questioning whether we had been attended to causing confusion subsequently another employee demanded our dogs rabies vaccination records despite no prior mention of this requirement during the appointment booking process or when calling to confirm that same morning when i expressed my inability to provide the papers at that moment he requested that i go fetch them myself to prevent any inconvenience to other customers with scheduled appointments in addition to these frustrations his attitude towards us was disrespectful leading us to conclude that it is best to avoid wasting our precious time and hardearned money at this business,0
the staff members are known for their friendliness and offer a hand wash service at an affordable cost despite not being very busy they have been in business for a long time however they do not go above and beyond to give your car a polished appearance initially the car looked satisfactory but upon returning home i noticed many watermarks and streaks on it i believe that if the staff improves their efforts they can be very successful due to their convenient location on scottsdale road,1
the omelet i ordered with spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes left much to be desired unfortunately the cheese was not incorporated into the omelet instead it was sprinkled on top resulting in a cold and unmelted taste moreover the omelet was overcooked to the point where it resembled a frittata appearing brown all over despite bringing up these issues with the employee who served me my complaint went unnoticed adding insult to injury even after barely consuming one bite the omelet was still cold it is disheartening to witness the lack of care exhibited by the staff members particularly considering the hefty price tag of 13 dollars for the omelet and a glass of milk disappointed by my second visit having hoped that the initial experience was an anomaly granting this restaurant a second shot turned out to be a huge mistake on my part while the employees were amiable during the ordering process this friendly demeanor failed to make up for their lack of concern catering to my dissatisfaction with subpar food quality and exorbitant prices it is difficult to justify ever returning,0
i have been bringing my dog to this grooming place for the past year and we only go there because of one specific groomer however on multiple occasions our dog was returned to us with wet fur and an unpleasant odor the groomer we trust takes her time and even gives us a progress report we always make appointments in advance and confirm them on the day yet when we arrived early this time two workers asked if we had been helped leaving us waiting finally another worker asked for our dogs rabies vaccination papers which nobody mentioned when i scheduled the appointment or called that morning to confirm he then asked me to go get the papers myself so that it wouldnt cause any delays for other customers on top of all this the worker had a rude attitude making it clear that its not worth spending time or money at this establishment,0
when you visit las vegas dont miss out on the incredible experience of vegas balloon rides while there are similar attractions in california nothing compares to the breathtaking view youll get from this particular ride from the front youll have a perfect view of the famous strip while the stunning red rock canyon serves as the backdrop behind you on one side youll see the sprawling cityscape of las vegas and on the other side youll catch a glimpse of the newer neighborhoods the convenience factor is worth mentioning as well  the crew offers the option to be picked up from your hotel or meet at a starbucks location if you choose the latter you can grab a cup of coffee since the ride usually takes place at sunrise during this time they provide a comprehensive explanation of the entire procedure stressing that customers will actively participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon while some may complain about this aspect its important to understand the challenges involved in handling heavy balloons especially considering the crew members age just before takeoff the attentive crew ensures everyone gets plenty of photo opportunities both inside and outside the balloon once youre airborne ascending over 1000 feet into the sky las vegas transforms into a surprisingly serene and peaceful sight defying its reputation as a vibrant party city as you face the breathtaking red rock canyon you can tune out the noise of the world and fully appreciate the stunning natural beauty it offers throughout the experience the pilot and crew maintain a warm and friendly atmosphere making everyone feel comfortable and entertained with their goodnatured humor to conclude the ride youre treated to champagne and cheese  a simple but thoughtful touch that adds to the overall enjoyment without a doubt i highly recommend taking vegas balloon rides,4
out of all the things i ate the pretzel dog stood out as being exceptionally flavorful and moist but my aunties lemonade definitely takes the cake,4
 this eatery supposedly serves truly genuine shanghai style dishes with their wonton being a standout delicacy according to word on the street,3
over the years i have consistently received topnotch service at this establishment and never once felt deceived or overcharged,4
the food here is topnotch with generous portions of meat and a plentiful serving of noodles in the pho the bowls they use are impressively large although one downside is that you might sweat like youre at the gym if you eat something hot some of my friends and i were dripping with sweat from our faces it would be great if they had ceiling fans or better air conditioning considering how hot it gets outside in vegas apologies for not remembering what i ate my friend ordered for me we came in a group of 10 and tried a good variety of dishes from the menu and everything was delicious,3
as for the food their chili is the best appetizer  tasty and hearty and the bread pudding is the goto dessert while we used to love their chicken fried steak as a nonsteak option we changed our minds and now prefer their fried chicken both dishes come with generous portions so reheating leftovers is important and the chicken wins in that aspect ,3
i was pleased to discover this companys ads stating that they are open daily until 6 not just in one ad but in several however after driving for over 30 minutes i arrived only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turned out to be someones cell phone i explained that the ad said they were open but the doors were locked when i asked about their actual hours i was told they are closed on sundays so i began my 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive home upon parking i checked my phone and found a text message from the store hot tub liquidators they hung up on me it is clear that there was a simple mistake if you look at all of my other ads you will see the correct hours posted upon request i would have been willing to rush over and work with you if asked im not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they consider those ads to be special somehow or they are being sarcastic i have reviewed six ads that all say the same thing i have never encountered a business that suggests i should check other ads instead of believing what they write in some ads i dont think its my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads however i do believe there are other places where i can purchase a hot tub,0
at last there is a dsw store in tempe providing customers with a wide array of brand choices and trendy styles what particularly caught my attention was their clearance section which houses a diverse collection of purses this clearance area is always my first stop while shopping at dsw afterward i thoroughly explore each aisle feeling like a kid who cant resist the allure of a candy store indeed dsw never fails to present tempting purchases in terms of customer service i have consistently experienced cheerful and friendly assistance especially as a rewards program member this membership enables me to accumulate points subsequently leading to coupons during my recent visit i happily redeemed a 10 coupon and dsw even grants birthday discounts as an added bonus,4
i found immense pleasure in my stay at this wonderfully vintage and conventional establishment the whole experience was fantastic particularly because i was given a room with a magnificent view upon request without any additional charges i strongly urge you to give it a go as it is truly worthwhile regarding the room it was neither exceptional nor mediocre falling somewhere in the middle however i must mention that the bathroom is quite small in size which restricts your ability to freely open and close the door while sitting on the toilet  consider yourself duly warned nevertheless the casino provided immense entertainment and my gambling budget lasted significantly longer than if i had stayed on the strip thats why i absolutely adore starting my trip downtown everything is conveniently located close by plus the added benefit of lower craps betting limits,2
when in las vegas make sure to include vegas balloon rides in your itinerary while there are other similar attractions in california the view from this ride is truly spectacular youll have the famous strip right in front of you the beautiful red rock canyon behind you and a stunning view of the city on one side and the new neighborhood on the other the convenience factor is also worth noting as the crew can either pick you up from your hotel or you can meet them at a starbucks they even give you some time to grab coffee since the ride usually takes place at sunrise during this time they explain the entire procedure and emphasize that customers will be involved in setting up and putting back the balloon i understand that some people might complain about this but we should cut the crew some slack because handling balloons is not an easy job especially considering their age once the balloon is almost ready the crew is very attentive and takes pictures of everyone both inside and outside the balloon after takeoff you get to see las vegas from a different perspective more than 1000 feet above the ground which makes the usually loud party city seem quiet and peaceful when facing the breathtaking red rock canyon you can simply tune out the world and focus on the beauty of nature the pilot and the crew are super friendly creating a great atmosphere throughout the experience at the end of the ride they even treat you with champagne and cheese showing their effort to make it special i highly recommend taking vegas balloon rides,4
the pretzel dog i had was exceptionally tasty and moist but my aunties refreshing lemonade takes the crown,4
my friend and i came to this place during memorial day weekend specifically during the transition period between brunch and dinner however despite arriving during brunch hours we were charged dinner prices despite this it was enjoyable to have the opportunity to taste a variety of dishes at first i thought the price for a vegas buffet was reasonable unfortunately when it came to the food itself i wasnt as impressed i decided to sample a bit of everything but the only dish that stood out to me was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after trying out some experimental plates i ended up filling up on more expensive items in order to feel like i got my moneys worth i also had an interest in trying the prime rib but my friend mentioned that the slice she had was overcooked despite requesting a mediumrare cut upon seeing the meats it did appear that they were overly cooked so i chose to skip the prime rib which was disappointing additionally i found the dessert selection to be unsatisfying i gathered visually appealing desserts such as macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry on my plate but unfortunately they all tasted mediocre most of the items only received one bite from me except for the flan which i tried twice but even then it didnt leave a strong impression the only dessert i actually finished was a cappuccino shooter without the whipped cream on top,2
excellent service i have been coming here for years and i have never felt ripped off or gouged,4
a visit to las vegas is incomplete without this musttry experience while there are other similar attractions in california the breathtaking view from this ride is unparalleled with the strip in the front red rock canyon in the back and the sprawling city of vegas on your left youll get a glimpse of the new neighborhood on your right our crew provided convenient pickup from our hotel or an option to meet at starbucks early in the morning for coffee before explaining the entire procedure they made it clear that despite being customers we would also participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon although some may complain we should appreciate the teams hard work as the balloons are heavy and they arent young either the crew was considerate enough to take numerous pictures of us capturing memories from different angles once airborne the vantage point of over 1000ft above the ground offered a unique perspective of vegas transforming the normally bustling city into peaceful silence as we flew towards red rock canyon i tuned out the world and immersed myself in the natural beauty surrounding us finding tranquility in its magnificence the pilot and crew were incredibly friendly adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience their affable nature and humorous anecdotes kept everyone at ease to conclude the ride we indulged in champagne and cheese demonstrating the effort they put into creating a memorable journey without hesitation i highly recommend vegas balloon rides,4
as a firsttime visitor to this establishment my expectations were elevated due to the consistently positive reviews along with the friendly demeanor of the staff and the impeccable cleanliness i observed entering with high hopes i had a particular vision for my nails since my family intends to take photographs later this week however my experience took an unfortunate turn when the technician utilized small nail tips that proved to be too fragile during the drying phase three of the tips ended up cracking as a result although the technician only replaced one of the damaged tips she attempted to salvage the other two by gluing them together but without success subsequently acrylic was applied over the cracked tips when i expressed my dissatisfaction about this situation the technician suggested covering up the issue by painting over it however concealing the problem does not solve it in any way moreover to my dismay the decoration i had initially requested was completely forgotten resulting in the most disappointing nail art i have ever received  far from what i had envisioned consequently i am now compelled to seek out another salon to have these inferior nails removed and replaced with a new set leaving me deeply disheartened,1
the employees are amiable and provided a hand wash at a reasonable price although their schedule isnt packed they have a longstanding presence however they do not put in extra effort to make your vehicle sparkle although the cars appearance seemed satisfactory initially upon reaching home i noticed numerous water spots and streaks i think if the staff stepped up their game they could thrive considering their favorable location along scottsdale road ,1
i believe that this establishment serves some of the worst chinese food i have ever experienced i cant help but wonder if its all a prank when i ordered delivery from this restaurant it took approximately one hour for the courier service to deliver it specifically i requested vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are wrapped in rice paper as sold in asian grocery stores however these spring rolls were unexpectedly fried and greasy indicating the use of old or excessively hot oil the color was significantly darkened likely due to the amount of residual oil furthermore the green vegetable stir fry did not live up to its name it consisted solely of limp bok choy without any other vegetables it lacked flavor and was topped with tasteless bits of garlic alongside the main dishes they provided fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were terrible the rice had no seasoning or vegetables while the noodles lacked flavor and texture everything i tried was poorly seasoned and lacked taste they included tempura shrimp and crab rangoon on the side which i didnt eat as a vegetarian nonetheless they appeared and smelled awful leading me to believe that someone could potentially become ill after consuming them the rangoon seemed frozen previously and the shrimp coating indicated that it may have bypassed the fryer altogether even my fortune cookie which was generic and made by karioutco didnt have any fortunes inside i am not exaggerating when i say that this place desperately needs a health inspection and should probably be shut down i genuinely feel sorry for the locals who eat here if you want quality chinese food i highly recommend trying establishments in coastal california houston or northeastern cities there is a stark difference in the overall experience to put it simply this was an incredibly bad dining experience and they do not deserve even one star think of this review as the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,0
after patiently waiting for an opportunity to try out this place i ended up feeling immensely disappointed apart from the savory sauce which stood out as a delightful element all the meat dishes turned out to be excessively dry and utterly lacking in taste on a brighter note the service met my expectations on a monday yet when considering the prices they would have been acceptable if the kitchen could deliver improved quality and flavor to elaborate further my order included brisket ribs and pulled pork with only the latter saving my overall review from earning just one star,1
i indulged in a delectable pretzelcoated hot dog that was perfectly juicy and flavorful although my aunties handmade lemonade outshines it in terms of sheer satisfaction,4
after conducting thorough research i was delighted to come across numerous ads from this company emphasizing their daily availability until 6 pm to my disappointment despite driving for more than half an hour i found their premises closed at 1130 am desperate to address the issue i dialed the contact number mentioned in the advertisement only to realize it was someones personal cell phone i expressed my frustration highlighting the discrepancy between the ads claim and the locked doors the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to make the 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip back home upon reaching my destination i checked my phone and discovered a text message from hot tub liquidators their response indicated a lack of customer service as they simply hung up on me it seems evident that there was a simple misunderstanding if you review all my other ads you will notice the accurate hours posted upon request had they communicated this earlier i would have been more than willing to adjust my plans and rush over for a resolution honestly i fail to comprehend why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless they deem those particular ads special or if they were attempting sarcasm in fact i have meticulously analyzed six ads all conveying the same information i have never encountered a business that implies i should crossverify their claims through other advertisements rather than trusting what they present in some of them personally i dont believe it is my responsibility to verify the accuracy of their ads nevertheless i am confident that there are alternative places where i can purchase a hot tub,0
at pizza rock you will find incredible food that will make you fall in love with their amazing pizzas the staff at this restaurant is simply awesome thanks to the exceptional leadership of ricky who knows how to take care of his customers,4
 despite avoiding this place like the plague since my last terrible visit several years ago i finally gave in and agreed to meet my sister and niece there for lunch today hoping that things had improved over time i thought it might be worth another try unfortunately that wasnt the case the first bite of my blackened fish tacos was overly salty causing my blood pressure to rise my sisters garlic parmesan wings also suffered from the same issue although the server did offer to replace our orders or exclude them from the bill the disappointing experience had already spoiled the mood i left very disappointed with this meal and im certain i wont be coming back,1
pizza rock offers a delightful culinary experience with its mouthwatering pizzas and incredible selection of dishes the staff working there is outstanding and under the leadership of ricky who is an exceptional manager customers are treated exceptionally well,4
in the past when i was in the army i would frequently visit logans in tennessee during those visits i would often consume large amounts of alcohol making the taste of the food less important however now that logans has expanded to arizona and i no longer drink the only aspects worth mentioning about this place are their tasty rolls and refreshing sweet tea its best not to have high expectations if you choose to dine here,1
i am giving an additional star to hugos due to the exceptional service provided by wait staff victor and vincent who impressed us greatly however i found the food to be only average although the fillet was large it did not stand out as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked some distinctiveness there was no wow factor in terms of taste nevertheless the mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing – even if they were radioactive i would still devour them in huge quantities on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not something she would reorder the salads were enjoyable the service was excellent and the wine list was impressive if you are downtown i recommend checking it out however i am unsure if it is worth taking a 20 cab ride to and from the strip just to dine here,2
i came here for the first time with high expectations based on the rave reviews nice staff and clean salon i had a specific request for my nails because my family has photoshoots planned this week unfortunately three of the small nail tips cracked while the glue was drying the technician only replaced one of the cracked tips and unsuccessfully tried to fix the other two by gluing them together before applying acrylic on top when i mentioned the cracked tips the technician suggested painting something over them to hide the problem which doesnt actually fix it on top of that the decoration i asked for was completely forgotten leading to the worst nail art ive ever received  not at all what i wanted now i have to go to another salon to remove these and get a new set im really disappointed,1
people say that the food here is genuinely representative of shanghai style with their wontons being especially tasty,3
i absolutely loved it at this vintage and standard place it was an incredible experience especially because they upgraded my room upon request to one with an amazing view and they didnt charge anything extra for it i strongly recommend trying it out because it is definitely worth it now when it comes to the room itself it was nothing extraordinary but not disappointing either however be cautious about the small bathroom that makes it inconvenient to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet consider yourself warned nonetheless the casino was so much fun and my money lasted way longer compared to when i stayed on the strip thats why i really enjoy starting my trip downtown where everything is conveniently close together and the low limits for craps are just a huge plus for me,2
tableside guacamole was good  the cart that was used could be a little nicer thoughnnthe lobster enchiladas were goodnnthe 900 margarita was not good  nnid still go back just wont order a cocktail,2
i can only describe my experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet as disappointing instead of having the cheese mixed in the omelet it was simply placed on top remaining cold and unmelted additionally the overcooked nature of the omelet gave it a frittatalike appearance with an unappealing brown color throughout despite expressing my concerns to the serving employee my complaint fell on deaf ears even after just one bite the omelet managed to stay cold adding to my overall disappointment what further exacerbates the situation is the lack of attention from the restaurant staff especially considering the steep price of 13 for the omelet and a glass of milk this being my second visit i had hoped that the initial negative experience was an aberration and decided to give this establishment another chance however this turned out to be a grave mistake although the employees were friendly when taking my order their failure to address my dissatisfaction has left an unpleasant impression coupled with belowaverage food quality and unjustifiably high prices it is safe to say i will not be returning to this restaurant again,0
the quality of the tableside guacamole was satisfactory but the appearance of the cart used could use some improvement the lobster enchiladas were highly enjoyable unfortunately the 900 margarita failed to meet my taste preferences nevertheless i would consider revisiting the place however i might avoid ordering another cocktail,2
i had heard so much about this place and eagerly waited for a chance to give it a try but sadly it didnt live up to my expectations the only positive aspect was the mouthwatering sauce while every single meat dish  be it the dry brisket or flavorless ribs  fell short of satisfaction nevertheless i must admit that the service was commendable especially given that it was a monday although the pricing seemed reasonable the establishment should prioritize their culinary mastery to justify it in particular out of the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i ordered it was the scrumptious pulled pork that elevated my review past a mere onestar rating,1
when i was on a business trip i opted for this particular place which offered a slightly older crowd and a peaceful ambiance one of the highlights was the absence of queues when it came to playing games i had the freedom to enjoy any game of my choice seamlessly moreover i took the opportunity to learn how to play three card poker and ended up making an impressive amount of 35000,2
the tableside guacamole was good but the cart that was used could have been nicer on the other hand the lobster enchiladas were enjoyable however the 900 margarita was not good despite this i would still return to the restaurant but i wouldnt order a cocktail,2
the team at the car wash establishment is pleasant and offers an affordable hand wash service despite not being overly busy they have maintained their presence in the industry for a long time unfortunately they dont go out of their way to give your car a thorough shine initially the car looked fine but when i got home i discovered several unsightly watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion with some improvements from the staff their advantageous location along scottsdale road could lead to great success,1
the oldworld charm and standard quality of this place truly captivated me  it was an absolute pleasure to spend time here what made it even better was getting a room with a splendid view upon request without any additional cost this place is definitely worth giving a try in terms of the room it can be described as average neither amazing nor disappointing however be aware that the bathroom is quite tiny hindering your ability to freely open or close the door while seated on the toilet  consider yourself forewarned despite that the casino offered an enjoyable experience and my funds lasted significantly longer than they would have on the strip for these reasons i absolutely love staying downtown during the first part of my trip as everything is conveniently located close together and the low limits for craps are an enormous advantage for me,2
throughout my business trip i chose to reside here due to its quieter environment catered toward a more mature audience what truly made my stay enjoyable was the hasslefree experience of accessing any game i desired without having to wait in addition i utilized my time effectively by learning the intricacies of three card poker and managed to amass a substantial sum of 35000,2
despite actively avoiding this establishment ever since a bad visit several years ago i took a chance and agreed to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today hoping that time had brought some improvements we placed our orders blackened fish tacos for me and garlic parmesan wings for my sister regrettably as soon as i sank my teeth into the taco an overwhelming saltiness hit me making me feel my blood pressure rise disappointingly my sister encountered the same problem with her wings although the server offered to replace our meals or exclude them from the final bill the mood had already been soured this unsatisfying dining experience has left me extremely disappointed ensuring that i will not be returning in the future,1
 its exciting that there is now a dsw store in tempe offering a wide range of brands and styles as well as a good selection of purses in the clearance section i always make the clearance section my first stop and then browse through each aisle feeling like a kid in a candy store because theres always something tempting to buy at dsw the staff provides cheerful and friendly service and being part of their rewards program allows you to earn points towards coupons during my recent visit i redeemed a 10 coupon and they also offer discounts for your birthday,4
i had been eagerly anticipating dining at this establishment for quite some time but unfortunately my experience left much to be desired the only redeeming factor was the delicious sauce as all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory given that it was a monday however the prices would have been justified if the quality and taste were better specifically i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was the latter that prevented me from giving a onestar review,1
 this place has provided me with exceptional service throughout all these years and ive never had the experience of being taken advantage of or overcharged,4
absolutely love pizza rock amazing food the staff is awesome ricky is a great manager and knows how to treat his customers,4
food is good here  they do not skimp out on the meat and they give a lot of noodles if you get pho  the bowls they serve the food in is huge too  the only pitfall about this place is if you eat something hot youre going to sweat your ass off like you were sweating at the gym  some of my friends and i were dripping sweat from our faces  this place has no ceiling fans  they should at least blast the ac or something considering how hot it is outside in vegasnnmy apologies i have no idea what i ate my friend ordered for me and i always forget the name  i came in a group of 10 people and they pretty much ordered a good chunk of things from the menu  everything they ordered was good  and there you have it,3
during memorial day weekend my friend and i decided to visit this establishment we arrived during the time when brunch transitions into dinner however we were surprised to find ourselves being charged dinner prices nevertheless we were excited about the opportunity to try a little bit of everything initially we considered the price for a vegas buffet to be quite decent unfortunately when it came to the quality of the food we were left unimpressed we decided to sample various dishes but the only one that truly stood out was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail and crab legs after experimenting with a few selections we resorted to filling our plates with more expensive options in order to feel like we got our moneys worth i had also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend who asked for a mediumrare cut found her slice to be overcooked upon closer inspection it became apparent that the meats were indeed overly cooked resulting in me deciding against trying the prime rib it was quite disappointing the dessert selection proved to be particularly underwhelming i gathered an assortment of visually appealing desserts such as macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolatecovered strawberry however their taste was just average most of these items only received one bite from me except for the flan which i tasted twice but it failed to leave a lasting impression the only dessert that managed to satisfy my taste buds was a cappuccino shooter without whipped cream on top,2
although the tableside guacamole was satisfying the cart used for its preparation could have been more attractive on a positive note the lobster enchiladas were delicious however the 900 margarita did not meet my expectations nonetheless i would still go back to the restaurant but i would avoid ordering another cocktail,2
the tableside guacamole tasted great but the cart used could have been more aesthetically pleasing on a positive note the lobster enchiladas were delicious however the 900 margarita didnt live up to expectations despite that i would still return although i might skip ordering a cocktail,2
when i was serving in the army i used to frequent logans in tennessee and would often get heavily intoxicated making the taste of the food irrelevant however since the chain has now been established in arizona for quite some time and i no longer consume alcohol all this place has to offer is delicious rolls and sweet tea  dont expect anything beyond that,1
i found the sandwiches to be average i opted for the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish but i felt that the horseradish was too overpowering the quality of the meat was okay but i might have ranked them higher if i hadnt already experienced dining at jimmy johns or capriottis if i am ever in the area again i might visit the restaurant though i am uncertain if i would purposely go out of my way specifically for their sandwiches,2
anticipating the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas had me full of excitement however our two companions decided on the filet option and couldnt help but rave about how delicious it was on the other hand my wife and i ordered the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak impressed us with a rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip served medium rare was unexpectedly tough chewy and difficult to consume despite these texture issues the flavor was fair to good we understand that sometimes even reputable restaurants can serve a subpar cut of meat and unfortunately this seemed to be one of those times,1
during my business trip i stayed at this location which had a more mature crowd and was relatively calm one of the benefits was that i didnt have to wait to play any game i wanted and i even learned how to play three card poker and won 35000,2
if youre planning a trip to las vegas dont forget to add vegas balloon rides to your mustdo list although there are other similar attractions available in california none of them compare to the incredible view you get from this ride with the famous strip in front of you the magnificent red rock canyon behind you and the sprawling city of vegas on one side youll also get a glimpse of the new neighborhoods on the other side the convenience factor is worth mentioning too as the crew gives you the option to either be picked up from your hotel or meet them at a starbucks plus they understand the importance of fueling up for the experience so theres time to grab coffee since the ride usually takes place at sunrise during this time they provide a detailed explanation of the entire procedure and emphasize that customers will actively participate in setting up and dismantling the balloon while some might complain about this aspect its important to appreciate the hard work of the crew considering the weighty balloons and their age as the balloon nears completion the attentive crew ensures everyone has ample opportunities for photos  both inside and outside the balloon once you take off youre in for a whole new perspective of las vegas soaring more than 1000 feet above the ground its amazing how the typically vibrant party city seems so peaceful from up high when you face the aweinspiring red rock canyon you can choose to tune out the rest of the world and immerse yourself in the beauty crafted by mother nature throughout the entire ride the pilot and crew are incredibly friendly creating an enjoyable atmosphere with their jokes and lighthearted banter and as a delightful conclusion to the experience youre treated to champagne and cheese  it may not be fancy but its definitely a thoughtful touch with absolute confidence i highly recommend vegas balloon rides,4
this establishment offers excellent value enjoyable experiences and topnotch quality additionally their efficiency allows customers to complete their meals within their lunch breaks as they simply choose their desired items from the conveyor belt and pay based on the color of the plate personally i love indulging in haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls if im extra hungry i might also treat myself to some gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll its not uncommon for me to receive messages from friends suggesting fast food outings and i almost always accept with enthusiasm,3
 according to popular opinion the food served at this restaurant is rumored to be an authentic representation of shanghai style cuisine and many patrons highly praise their wonton for its exquisite taste,3
after researching my options i was happy to find this company stated open daily until 6 in their ads not just one of their ads but several so i drove a little over 30 minutes only to find them closed at 1130 am i called the number in the ad which turns out to be someones cell phone i explained the ad said they were open but the doors are locked i asked what the actual hours are and he said closed sundays so i started the drive home 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive time and when i parked i checked my phone to find a text from the storennhot tub liquidatorsnreally you hung up on me obviously there was a simple miscue look at  every one of my other ads and you will see the hours posted correctly upon request i would have run over and worked with you nnim not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they are special somehow or he is being sarcastic i have reviewed 6 ads that all say the same thing ive never had a business imply i should check other ads rather than believe what they write in some ads nni dont think its my job to check the accuracy of their ads i do think there are other places to buy a hot tub,0
tex az is one of our top choices for meeting people in central phoenix particularly those from out of town who expect arizona restaurants to have a saloonlike atmosphere to be considered local we bring newcomers here frequently because it feels much more genuine than going to places like rawhide personally i grew up on a cattle farm and know good steak and tex az delivers with its wellaged flavorful steaks the cut is usually great as well so there are no disappointments if you visit try their basic but expected ny strip presentation  after all youre not paying ruths chris prices ,3
this establishment serves some of the most terrible chinese food i have ever encountered i cant help but wonder if its some kind of prank when i ordered delivery from them it took an entire hour for the courier service to get it to me i specifically requested vegetarian spring rolls and a green vegetable stir fry typically spring rolls are made with rice paper but these ones were fried and greasy suggesting the use of old or excessively hot oil they were significantly darkened in color as for the green vegetable stir fry it was a disappointment it only consisted of limp bok choy and lacked any other vegetables the dish had no flavor and was topped with garlic bits that added no taste on the side they included fried rice and lo mein noodles both of which were awful the rice lacked seasoning and vegetables while the noodles had no flavor or texture nothing had any seasoning or taste to try and salvage the meal i poured sauce over everything they sent but it didnt help they also included tempura shrimp and crab rangoon which i didnt eat since i am a vegetarian but they looked and smelled terrible i wouldnt be surprised if someone got sick after eating them the rangoon seemed like it had been frozen before and the shrimp coating indicated that it hadnt been fried properly even my fortune cookie which was a generic one made by karioutco didnt have any fortunes inside im not making this up this place definitely needs a health inspection and probably should be shut down i feel sorry for the locals who eat here if you want good chinese food i highly recommend trying places in coastal california houston or northeastern cities there is a noticeable difference in quality overall this was a remarkably bad experience and they dont deserve even one star consider this review the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy,0
im giving hugos an extra star for the wait staff victor and vincent double teamed us and blew our socks off nthe food was just ok ni had the fillet and while it was big it wasnt one of the best fillets ive ever had it just lacked a bit of character there was no wow factor i guess nthe mashed potatos are the best ive ever had they could be radioactive and i would still eat them by the truckload nmy wife had the veal and it was a edible but nothing she would order again nthe salads are cool the service great and the wine list was stout if your downtown check it out but im not sure i would take the 20 cab ride to and from from the strip just to eat here,2
filled with anticipation i was excitedly looking forward to trying the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas however much to my dismay our two friends decided on the filet option and couldnt help but rave about its exceptional flavor in contrast my wife and i opted for the ny strip and cowboy steak while the cowboy steak left us impressed with a solid rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip served medium rare turned out to be unexpectedly tough chewy and challenging to consume despite these textural issues the taste ranged from fair to good we understand that even renowned restaurants can sometimes serve a mediocre cut of meat and unfortunately this seemed to be one of those occasions,1
the place had a charming and standard ambiance that i absolutely adored my time there was enjoyable especially since i was given a room with a beautiful view without any extra cost i highly recommend giving it a try as it is definitely worth it however the room itself was nothing out of the ordinary but not disappointing either be aware that the bathroom is quite small making it difficult to open or close the door freely while sitting on the toilet consider yourself warned despite that the casino provided a fun experience and my money lasted much longer compared to when i stayed on the strip personally i love staying downtown for the first part of my trip because everything is conveniently close together and the low limits in craps are a huge plus for me,2
my family and i are huge fans of hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and read some amazing reviews we were incredibly eager to give it a try particularly the positive comments about their onion rings got us even more excited we currently reside in maricopa az which is around a 35minute drive from teds hence we really hoped that the journey would be worthwhile however we ended up being disappointed with our experience we ordered eight regular hotdogs  mine had chili mustard and onions while my wife and kids stuck with ketchup along with the hotdogs we also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake,0
tex az is a one of our favorite places to takemeet up with people in central phoenixespecially folks from out of town that are thinking that arizona restaurants should be in a saloontype atmoshere to be considered local  nnwe take the newbies from out of town here pretty frequently  it seems alot more genuine to most than going to a place like say rawhiden  ni grew up on a cattle farmand know good steak  the steak we get at tex az is well aged and has great flavor  the cut in my expereince is usually great as well  no disappointments there  try the ny strip presentation is basic but isnt that what you would expect you are not paying ruths chris prices rightnnbest appetizertheir chili  it is very tasty and very hearty  best dessertthe bread puddingnnwhile the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite nonplainsteak entreewe have recently converted to the fried chicken  it is very good nwith both chicken fried dishes  the leftover reheating capability is pretty important since you get so much foodso the chicken wins out on this onethe chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak  nnthe atmosphere iswellit is uniqueand isnt that what you want in your local saloonsteak house  0  the service is equally as localquirky  we consider it ambiance and character i dont think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there as a note  nnparking can be a bit challenging on a busy nightbut it all adds to the charm  nnwe have likely been to tex az about 25 times over the years  not once were we disappointedbut we know what we are signing up for  nnthis isnt gourmeta spear of asparagus would not dare show its face at tex azbut it is traditional type hearty old west fare and the flavor is simple yet great,3
although i found the tableside guacamole to be tasty i feel that a more elegant cart could have enhanced the experience conversely the lobster enchiladas stood out as a highlight regrettably the 900 margarita left much to be desired nonetheless i wouldnt mind going back albeit with an intention to skip alcoholic beverages,2
unfortunately the omelet i ordered with spinach goat cheese and sundried tomatoes did not meet my expectations the cheese was not incorporated into the omelet but was instead sprinkled on top resulting in a cold and unmelted taste moreover the omelet was overcooked and resembled more of a frittata with its overall brown appearance despite bringing up these issues with the serving employee my complaint was disregarded even after only taking one bite the omelet remained cold it is disheartening to witness the lack of care from the staff members especially considering the hefty price tag of 13 for the omelet and a glass of milk my second visit hoping to give the restaurant another chance turned out to be a huge mistake although the employees were amiable during the ordering process their lack of concern for my dissatisfaction with the subpar food quality and exorbitant prices makes it difficult to justify returning,0
according to reports this place offers authentic shanghaistyle cuisine and patrons rave about their delicious wontons,3
i had a different impression of this place based on its exterior but once i walked in it exceeded my expectations the ambience was great with low lighting and beautiful decorations additionally the service was excellent and the menu had a good selection of food and drinks everything i ordered was delicious although i regretted not having any space left for dessert specifically i had my eye on the fried plantain with coconut ice cream i definitely plan on returning for that irresistible dessert,3
i had a great time at this oldfashioned and traditional establishment the atmosphere here was fantastic and i even managed to get a room with a splendid view by simply requesting it without having to pay anything extra i highly encourage you to give it a try because it is definitely worthwhile as for the room itself it was average  not amazing but not disappointing either just be aware that the bathroom is very small and it can be quite challenging to freely open or close the door while sitting on the toilet you have been warned nevertheless the casino was a lot of fun and my money lasted significantly longer than if i had stayed on the strip thats why i really enjoy staying downtown during the first part of my trip  everything is so conveniently close by and the low betting limits for craps are a huge advantage for me,2
the employees are friendly and provide a reasonably priced hand wash service although they are not always busy they have been around for a long time unfortunately they do not make extra efforts to make your car shine the car looked acceptable initially but when i arrived back home i discovered numerous watermarks and streaks on it in my opinion if the staff enhances their performance they could thrive because of the high traffic location on scottsdale road,1
 some people claim that the cuisine at this restaurant is genuinely authentic shanghai style and they particularly recommend trying their wonton as it is exceptional,3
 finally theres a dsw store in tempe that offers an extensive variety of brands and styles including a fantastic selection of purses in their clearance section every time i visit my first destination is always the clearance section as it never fails to impress then i explore every aisle with childlike excitement finding dsw to be a place where there are always enticing items to purchase the staff is consistently cheerful and friendly particularly towards members of their rewards program who can earn points for valuable coupons during my most recent visit i had the pleasure of redeeming a 10 coupon and they also shower customers with discounts on their birthdays,4
the food at this place is delicious and they are generous with the meat servings when you order pho they give you a lot of noodles and the bowls they use are huge however be aware that if you eat something spicy youll sweat profusely as there are no ceiling fans or sufficient air conditioning to combat the heat in vegas despite that my friends and i enjoyed the meal and were very satisfied,3
you wont be disappointed when you visit this place it truly delivers on fantastic value delightful fun and outstanding quality furthermore they excel at providing quick service during your work lunch hour just sit down pick whatever catches your eye from the convenient conveyor belt and determine the price based on the plates color as for my personal favorites the haru sushis maguro tuna and rainbow rolls hit the spot every time on occasions when hunger strikes i might treat myself to additional options like gyoza jalapeno poppers or a mouthwatering spicy tuna roll it never takes long for me to receive tempting invitations from girlfriends for fast food adventures and i rarely decline,3
it is said to be authentic shanghai style cuisine and some dishes are their wonton is very good,3
 after avoiding this place for years due to a bad experience i decided to have lunch with my sister and niece there today however much to my disappointment things had not changed the blackened fish tacos i ordered were extremely salty raising my blood pressure my sisters garlic parmesan wings faced the same issue although the server offered to replace our dishes or remove them from the bill the mood was already ruined i was very disappointed with this meal and will definitely not be returning,1
for the past year i have been getting my dog groomed at this particular place exclusively relying on a single groomer due to our past bad experiences they consistently returned our dog to us with damp fur and an unwelcome smell as if we had just dropped her off this groomer fortunately takes her time and provides us with a detailed report on our dogs progress we always book appointments well in advance and call to confirm on the day but upon arriving early for our most recent appointment two workers questioned if we had received any assistance leaving us unsure eventually another staff member demanded our dogs rabies vaccination papers which no one mentioned when i made the appointment or called earlier in the day moreover he requested that i retrieve the paperwork myself to avoid inconveniencing others with my scheduled appointment adding insult to injury the worker adopted a confrontational demeanor leading us to conclude that this place is not worth our time or money,0
the sandwiches were ok  had the duke with the cranberry mayo and horseradish  the horseradish was a little overpowering  the meat qaulity it ok  maybe if i had never come across jimmy johns or capriottis i would have ranked them higher  if im in the neighborhood id probably go back just not sure id go out of my way for one of them,2
after working nonstop under the hot sun for 12 hours without a break or lunch i was excited to try out this restaurant it looked nice and clean however we had to wait an incredibly long time 4560 minutes for our food this was frustrating for both me and my oneyearold baby who was getting tired and bored to make matters worse the manager even thought we were finished eating and asked if we needed anything else i had to explain that we were still waiting for our dinner if only they had something like netflix on the tv for entertainment maybe we would consider going back but there are so many other thai restaurants out there that this place gets a thumbs down from us the taco shop next door looks more appealing,0
i had a terrible experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet that i ordered the cheese was not inside the omelet but on top cold and unmelted the omelet was overcooked and resembled more of a frittata with its brown color despite my complaint to the employee it went ignored even after just one bite the omelet remained cold no one seemed to care especially considering the expensive prices this was my second visit and i was unhappy during my first as well i hoped that the first visit was just a fluke but giving this restaurant a second chance turned out to be a big mistake the employees were friendly when i placed my order but their lack of concern or care is inexcusable the food is subpar and the prices are unreasonably high,0
ive been a loyal customer here for years because of their exceptional service and they have always been fair with their pricing,4
this is a great place for value fun and quality  not to mention they get you in and out on your work lunch hour super fast  you sit down grab what you want off the conveyor belt and pay by the color of the plate  my standard favs are haru sushi maguro tuna and rainbow rolls  mmmm  if i am super hungry i might throw in gyoza or jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll  not too long goes by between getting an email or an im from a gf saying fast food bait and i always say yes,3
i loved it here old classic and standard nni had a great time and even got a room with a fse view upon request no extra charge try it its worth it asknthe room was blah nothing to write home about but it wasnt a dump either the bathroom is very small if you are seating down at the toilet you wont be able to openclose the door freely you have been warnednnthe casino was fun and my money lasted way long that on the stripnni love staying downtown for the first part of my trip everything so close together and the lowlimits in craps is just a huge plus for me,2
in eager anticipation i looked forward to savoring the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas to my dismay our two friends opted for the filet expressing their absolute delight in its taste meanwhile my wife and i chose to indulge in the ny strip and cowboy steak although the cowboy steak managed to earn a commendable rating of 7 out of 10 the ny strip cooked to a mediumrare perfection proved to be excessively tough chewy and challenging to swallow nonetheless the overall flavor of the dish ranged from acceptable to good we acknowledge that even excellent dining establishments sometimes serve a disappointing cut of meat and regrettably we found ourselves experiencing exactly that this time,1
experience an exceptional blend of value entertainment and excellence at this remarkable venue its perfect for a satisfying meal during your work lunch hour where you can conveniently pick your preferred dishes from the conveyor belt and pay based on the plate color personally i highly recommend the delectable maguro tuna and rainbow rolls from haru sushi if im feeling extra hungry i might also indulge in gyoza jalapeno poppers or a spicy tuna roll whenever my girlfriends suggest fast food outings i always eagerly agree,3
while i found the tableside guacamole to be tasty i think the cart used for preparing it could have been more elegant conversely the lobster enchiladas stood out as a highlight regrettably the 900 margarita didnt live up to expectations nonetheless i wouldnt mind going back albeit without ordering a cocktail,2
hugos deserves an additional star due to the outstanding service provided by their wait staff particularly victor and vincent these two individuals truly left a lasting impression on us with their impeccable service however the food itself did not live up to our expectations despite the sizable portion of the fillet we ordered it did not rank among the best fillets i have ever tasted it lacked the distinctiveness required to make it truly remarkable nevertheless the mashed potatoes stole the show even if they contained harmful substances i would still indulge in them without hesitation on the other hand my wifes choice of veal was decent but didnt leave a memorable impression the salads were cool the service was outstanding and the extensive wine list impressed us if you happen to be in the downtown area give this place a try however im skeptical about whether its worth the 20 cab fare to and from the strip,2
breaking my selfimposed ban on visiting this place due to a terrible past encounter i reluctantly agreed to meet my sister and niece here for lunch with hopes that things had improved over the years i dared to give it another chance alas reality struck once our food arrived as i bit into my eagerly anticipated blackened fish tacos an intensifying saltiness overwhelmed my taste buds causing my blood pressure to rise uncomfortably unfortunately my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue robbing us of any dining pleasure despite the servers offer to replace our dishes or remove them from our bill the damage had already been done this disappointing meal has sealed my decision to never set foot in this place again,1
hugos deserves an extra star due to the outstanding service provided by its wait staff especially victor and vincent they left a lasting impression on us with their doubleteam approach and exceptional skills however i found the food to be average overall despite the fact that the fillet was quite large in size it did not surpass my expectations as one of the best fillets i have ever had it lacked that special touch that sets apart an extraordinary dish nevertheless the mashed potatoes were undoubtedly the highlight of the meal even if they were potentially hazardous i would devour them without hesitation on the other hand my wife ordered the veal which was decent but not memorable enough to inspire her to order it again the salads were enjoyable the service was topnotch and the wine list impressed us with its variety if you happen to be downtown it is worth checking out this restaurant however i am skeptical about whether it is worth taking a 20dollar cab ride to and from the strip just for the sake of dining here,2
best pizza i have found here in the east valley  the high quality ingredients they use make the difference between a good pizza and a great pizzanits not fine dining decor but that is not why i always return keep up the high quality ingredients along with the excellent tomato sauce and the stars will continue to be high,4
despite working for 12 hours without any breaks or lunch under the scorching sun i was eagerly looking forward to trying out this restaurant it turned out to be a pleasant and clean place but unfortunately our food took an unbearable amount of time around 4560 minutes to arrive for the two of us and our oneyearold baby as my baby grew tired and bored even the manager assumed we had finished eating when asked if there was anything else we needed i replied that we were still waiting for our dinner which hadnt been served yet if only the establishment had offered entertainment like movies or netflix on their television it might prompt us to give it another chance however considering the numerous thai food options available elsewhere this specific place receives a disappointing rating and we find the taco shop next door more appealing,0
the sandwich experience was average specifically the duke sandwich topped with cranberry mayo and horseradish had flavors that seemed a little too dominant while the meat quality was acceptable my ranking might have been higher had i not encountered establishments like jimmy johns or capriottis if i happen to find myself nearby i might visit again except im unsure if i would go out of my way solely for one of their sandwiches,2
the neighborhood bar is a welcoming spot where many people become regulars any recently opened restaurant which had a damaged building from previous owners will face difficulties and problems to resolve despite being open for only a week we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and diverse menu the drinks are reasonably priced for a dive bar but the food selection is unique and delicious in mesa they offer a wide range of draft beers and wines the staff and managers are efficient in handling difficult customers professionally this place is a refreshing change from overpriced chain restaurants or having to travel to another part of town we are excited about future happy hour visits and eager to try their brunch menu i truly hope this establishment thrives as we need more successful local businesses in the area,3
the sandwiches were decent particularly the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish although the horseradish flavor was a bit overwhelming for me the quality of the meat was satisfactory but if i hadnt tried jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have given them a higher rating if i happen to be in the area i would consider going back although im not certain if id make a special trip just for their sandwiches,2
when i served in the army i used to go to logans in tennessee and would often get so drunk that the taste of the food didnt matter however now that the chain has been in arizona for a while and i no longer drink the only good things about this place are the delicious rolls and sweet tea dont expect much else here,1
after working 12 hours under the sun with no break and lunch so excited to try this restaurant which was a nice place very clean our food took so long 4560 min for two pp and my 1 year old baby my baby was getting tired and bored even the manager thought we were done eating he asked can i get anything else for you i answered  we are just waiting for our dinner still we havent started yet if the place had a movie netflix on the tv for entertainment  i think we would go back but nah there so many thai food out there that this place is rated two thumbs down taco shop next door looks good,0
the pizza ive discovered here in the east valley stands out thanks to their use of topnotch ingredients elevating it from being merely good to truly outstanding while the décor may not resemble fine dining its not the reason why i keep coming back as long as they maintain their commitment to quality ingredients and superb tomato sauce theyll always receive high praise,4
i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while now but to my disappointment the only thing that stood out was the sauce the meats were all dry and lacked flavor the service on the other hand was good considering it was a monday while the prices would have been reasonable if the quality was better they definitely need improvement in their kitchen among the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i had the pulled pork saved the review from getting a 1star rating,1
 for an extended period i have continuously chosen to be a patron at this establishment due to their outstanding service they have never made me feel swindled or exploited,4
indulge in the absolute deliciousness of pizza at pizza rock where not only are the food options amazing but also the staffs service is topnotch thanks to rickys superb management skills customers are pampered and treated with immense care,4
during my time in the army i used to go to logans in tennessee where i would often become heavily intoxicated not caring about how the food tasted now that the chain has established itself in arizona and i have given up drinking the only noteworthy items at this restaurant are their delectable rolls and wonderful sweet tea if you come here with high expectations you will likely be disappointed,1
having waited eagerly to visit this place i was let down by my experience the only highlight was the tasty sauce however the meats were all dry and tasteless nonetheless the service was impressive especially given that it was a monday although the prices would be fair if the quality and taste were superior the kitchen needs work out of the brisket ribs and pulled pork that i ordered it was the pulled pork alone that prevented my review from descending into a 1star rating,1
i use to go to logans in tennessee when i was in the army id normally get so sloshed it didnt matter what the food tasted like but now the chain has been in az for a while and i no longer drink this place has good rolls and sweet tea thats it dont expect much here,1
while on my business trip i chose to stay at this place which had an older crowd and was quieter what i liked about it was that i could play any game without having to wait and i also learned how to play three card poker resulting in me making 35000,2
rephrases,3
during my business trip i decided to stay at this location where the atmosphere was more mature and serene the best part was the convenience of being able to indulge in any game that caught my interest without a long wait additionally i acquired new skills like mastering three card poker and managed to earn 35000,2
after avoiding this place like the plague since my last unpleasant experience several years ago i finally decided to meet my sister and niece for lunch there today however to my disappointment it seems that not much has changed the blackened fish tacos i ordered were excessively salty causing me to feel my blood pressure rise similarly my sisters garlic parmesan wings suffered from the same issue the server did offer us the choice of getting different items or having these dishes removed from our bill but unfortunately the experience was already ruined considering this disappointing meal i have made up my mind not to return here again,1
my research led me to discover this companys advertisements which prominently stated their daily operating hours until 6 pm what caught my attention was not just one ad mentioning this but several encouraged by their apparent availability i made a journey of slightly over 30 minutes however my excitement turned into frustration when i arrived at their location only to find their doors closed at 1130 am seeking answers i immediately dialed the number provided in the advertisement only to realize that it belonged to someones personal cell phone trying to convey my disappointment i emphasized that their ad explicitly mentioned being open during this time in response the person on the other end informed me that they are closed on sundays leaving me with no choice but to return home spending a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes on my trip once i parked a text message from the store hot tub liquidators appeared on my phone to my surprise they had simply hung up on me it is pretty obvious that there was some miscommunication or misunderstanding had they informed me beforehand i would have been more than willing to accommodate their schedule and rush over for a resolution i am not entirely sure why the word other is enclosed in quotation marks unless it implies a particular significance or conveys sarcasm i carefully examined six different advertisements all conveying identical information throughout my experiences no business has ever suggested that i should crosscheck the accuracy of their claims through alternative ads instead of trusting what they express in just some of them in my opinion it is not my responsibility as a customer to ensure the veracity of their advertisements however i firmly believe there are other establishments where hot tubs can be purchased,0
an inviting neighborhood bar this cozy place quickly becomes a regular haunt for many people as with any newly opened restaurant particularly one that inherits a building in need of repair there are inevitable challenges and obstacles to overcome nevertheless despite being operational for just one week we were pleasantly surprised by the warm and friendly demeanor of the staff members and the extensive menu options they offer the drinks are reasonably priced compared to other dive bars while the food selection is exceptionally unique and mouthwatering setting it apart from other establishments in mesa with an impressive range of draft beers and an adequate wine list there is something to suit every taste preference one aspect that impressed us was how efficiently the staff and managers handle difficult customers demonstrating exemplary professionalism in comparison to overpriced chain restaurants or having to journey to another part of town this place presents a muchwelcomed change within our locality we eagerly anticipate the numerous happy hours on the horizon and cannot wait to sample their brunch offerings it is my genuine hope that this thriving local business flourishes as our community would greatly benefit from more successful enterprises like this one,3
at this particular place the staff is known for being friendly and providing customers with reasonably priced hand wash services while they may not always have a lot of customers they have managed to establish themselves well over time regrettably their efforts to make your car look sparkling clean are lacking upon closer inspection i noticed multiple water spots and streaks on the car after returning home personally i believe that if the staff were to step up their game they would greatly prosper given their prime location on scottsdale road,1
when it comes to pizza in the east valley nothing surpasses the greatness of what ive discovered here the key factor that sets it apart is undoubtedly the use of premium ingredients – making all the difference between a good pizza and an exceptional one the absence of opulent decorations never deters my return visits its the promise of consistently elevated flavors stemming from impeccable ingredients and delectable tomato sauce that keeps me hooked,4
i found the sandwiches to be alright especially the one called the duke featuring cranberry mayo and horseradish however the horseradish taste was overpowering and dominated the overall flavor as for the quality of the meat it was decent yet my preference might have been different if i hadnt already been exposed to restaurants like jimmy johns or capriottis if i am ever in the neighborhood there is a chance ill revisit although i am uncertain if i would purposefully go out of my way specifically for their sandwiches,2
i enjoyed the pretzel dog a lot it was juicy and delicious however my aunties lemonade is even better,4
i had a terrible experience with the spinach goat cheese and sundried tomato omelet i ordered the cheese was not inside the omelet but on top cold and unmelted additionally the overcooked omelet resembled more of a fritatta as it was brown all over despite informing the employee who served the dish my complaint was completely disregarded even after taking just one bite the omelet remained cold it is disappointing that no one seemed to care especially considering the high prices 13 dollars for an omelet and glass of milk this was my second visit hoping the first was just a fluke but giving this restaurant a second chance turned out to be a big mistake the employees were friendly when i ordered but their lack of concern or care regarding my dissatisfaction is inexcusable the food quality is subpar and the prices are unreasonably high for what you receive,0
i eagerly anticipated the dry aged ny strip at gallaghers in las vegas but unfortunately our friends decided to order the filet instead and couldnt stop raving about it my wife and i went with the ny strip and cowboy steak hoping for a similar level of satisfaction however while the cowboy steak scored a respectable 7 out of 10 the medium rare ny strip proved to be disappointingly tough chewy and difficult to swallow nonetheless the overall taste of the dish ranged from acceptable to good its worth noting that even the best restaurants occasionally serve a subpar cut of meat and regrettably this appears to have been one of those times,1
the sandwiches were satisfactory i tried the duke sandwich with cranberry mayo and horseradish but i found the horseradish to be too strong the quality of the meat was acceptable although if i hadnt been to places like jimmy johns or capriottis before i might have ranked them higher if i happen to be in the area again i would probably go back but im not sure if i would make a special trip for one of their sandwiches,2
i and the family love hotdogs especially chili dogs when we heard about this place and read some of the great reviews we were so eager to try it especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well we currently live in maricopa az about 35 min drive from teds so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive we were disappointed we ordered 8 of the regular dogs i had chili mustard and onions on mine the wife and kids had just ketchup we also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake the dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked i love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside but the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor very bland not even salt my chili sauce was the worst i have ever had it tasted more like tomato paste that i use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce the onion rings were more like fragments with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something the milk shake was ok flavor but was in like a 6 oz cup or something seemed way overpriced as everything else i could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime and it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good the place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business but we will not be back oh also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint total cost for 8 dogs a powerade strawberry shake and the order of onion fragments was almost 37 ridiculous,0
i tried the pretzel dog and found it to be incredibly delicious and succulent although my aunties homemade lemonade is still superior,4
giving an extra star to hugos is justified by the amazing service delivered by their wait staff specifically victor and vincent these two individuals truly went above and beyond exceeding our expectations unfortunately the food left much to be desired despite the fillets generous portion size it lacked the unique qualities that would earn it a spot among the best fillets i have ever had it failed to create that wow moment however the mashed potatoes were undeniably exceptional even if they happened to be hazardous i wouldnt hesitate to consume them in copious amounts conversely my wifes choice of veal was merely satisfactory and not something she would order again the salads were enjoyable the service was topnotch and the wine list showcased an impressive variety if you find yourself downtown its worth giving this place a shot although im unsure if its worth a 20 cab ride to and from the strip,2
a fantastic little bar in the neighborhood where its easy to become a regular customer any newly opened restaurant especially one with a building that has seen some wear and tear from previous owners will inevitably experience some struggles and problems as they get settled however even though this place has only been open for a week we were pleasantly surprised by the kindness of the staff and the variety of dishes on the menu the prices for the drinks are reasonable for a dive bar and the food menu is wonderfully unique and packed with tasty options there is an extensive selection of draft beers and several wines to choose from the management does an excellent job of handling difficult customers in a professional manner this establishment offers a pleasant change for residents in the area who are tired of opting for expensive chain restaurants or driving to other parts of town we cant wait to enjoy their many happy hour deals in the future and are excited about trying their brunch offerings it is my sincere wish that this thriving local business thrives and succeeds as our community truly needs more flourishing enterprises like this one,3
tex az has a unique atmosphere that captures the essence of a local saloon and steakhouse this ambiance adds character and charm to your dining experience the service is equally local and quirky contributing to the overall ambiance in all our visits we have never had to worry about beverages running dry parking can be a bit challenging on busy nights but it only enhances the charm of the place over the years we have been to tex az approximately 25 times and we were never disappointed however its crucial to note that this isnt gourmet dining instead they offer traditional hearty old west fare with simple yet great flavors,3
the sandwiches were decent i ordered the duke sandwich which came with cranberry mayo and horseradish unfortunately the horseradish flavor overpowered everything else the meat quality was okay but my opinion might have been better if i hadnt already tried jimmy johns or capriottis if i find myself in the neighborhood i might consider going back although im unsure if i would go out of my way just for their sandwiches,2
this was my first time here and i had high hopes because the reviews were really good the ladies were nice enough and the salon was clean i went in and asked for something pretty specific because my family are having pictures taken this week the tips the tech was putting tips on my nails where to small three of them cracked while the glue was dying she only removed one to affix a new nail tip the other two she tried to glue together unsuccessfully and continued to apply the acrylic on top when i said something about the cracked tips the tech told me that she would just paint something over them covering up the problem doesnt fix it the decoration i asked for was forgotten completely and instead i received the worst nail art ive ever had not at all what i wanted i now have to go to another salon to have these taken off and a new set put on im very disappointed,1
