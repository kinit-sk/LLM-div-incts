we have never stayed at a hotel as amazing as this one before it gives you a feeling of being on cloud nine with its spacious rooms breathtaking views and unbeatable location,4
i hesitated when deciding on the star rating because the food surpasses expectations especially the x girlfriend roll however the service leaves much to be desired despite being a frequent customer every visit results in encountering the same unpleasant and disinterested staff member this negative experience has inclined me to not consider returning,2
this place is awesome i absolutely enjoy devouring pizza just like they do in italy the pizza is fantastic not oily at all plus the servers are speedy with refilling drinks however when i went there with a friend the atmosphere felt somewhat lifeless its clean and nice but it could use some liveliness,3
the establishment gives off a distinctively sophisticated and alluring vibe but be prepared for disappointment as the prices do not align with the experience youll find yourself spending a hefty 20 bucks on a mere glass of wine,1
attending the screening of g force in 3d here cost me 1050 for the tickets the theater was impressively spacious wellkept and had superior sound quality leaving me content right before entering there is a food court where you can grab a bite be sure to carry a big bag to store your food in advance by the way did i remember to mention that,3
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
at one point in history these gentlemen possessed substantial capabilities however the current landscape demands a different approach warranting ones consideration of alternative options,0
the overall experience at the diner was decent although a bit costly and the wait staff seemed distant,1
deciding on the appropriate number of stars proved challenging due to mixed experiences the food impressed me especially the x girlfriend roll which i absolutely loved nevertheless the service falls short of expectations it seems that no matter how often i visit the same grumpy and unmotivated member of staff serves me considering this recurring lackluster experience it is highly unlikely that i will revisit,2
i have a strong affinity for innout however this specific establishment fails to meet expectations on one occasion the meal i received was served cold while the duration of my stay at the drivethru exceeded 20 minutes given that i had merely ordered a burger this lack of efficiency displayed by the staff is truly disheartening it is indispensable that they make improvements promptly,0
have you thought about implementing signage indicating the hours of operation it seems like multiple groups had to endure long waits therefore having a digital sign displaying closed would greatly enhance customer service,0
despite its great prices this stores pizzas are unsatisfactory and most of it ended up being discarded due to the extremely unpleasant crust,2
once upon a time i had an intense passion for wicked spoon however this place has now risen to the status of being the ultimate buffet spot in vegas for me everything served here was exceptional and i struggled to find even a single notable flaw while a few selections stood out above the rest the overall magnificence of this buffet surpassed all expectations,3
this spot has been my destination of choice on four separate visits and without fail each time has rewarded me with an amazing spray tan experience prompting me to plan another visit in the immediate future,4
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
let me tell you about the most fantastic hummus ive ever tasted its so versatile that i use it in all sorts of meals thanks to its diverse range of flavors my absolute favorite combination is garlic hummus with a hint of beet hummus additionally adding other flavorpacked hummus varieties turns any dish into a culinary delight  utterly delicious,4
what if there was signage clearly stating the operating hours there were instances where various groups had to wait for an extended period so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this straightforward approach would significantly improve customer service,0
this is my initial visit and i chose to have a chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the most dreadful meal ive ever had i found the flavor in the chicken lacking the appeal to keep me interested as for the falafel although i am no expert this particular one had a generous amount of parsley resulting in a strong bitter and grassy taste,2
 i happened to see g force in 3d at this particular establishment where they charged a hefty 1050 for each ticket the theater experience itself was impressive  the size of the auditorium was commendable cleanliness was top priority and the sound system delivered exceptional quality what added to my contentment was that right before the entrance theres a food court allowing you to conveniently bring a large bag and get your food sorted out beforehand by the way did i already express this,3
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
eating this pizza was the most unpleasant culinary experience of my life,0
this hotel surpasses all others weve ever visited in terms of excellence with its expansive rooms delightful views and perfect location its simply unbeatable making you feel like youre conquering the world,4
while the cleanliness and appearance of this place were commendable the atmosphere felt somewhat dull during my visit with a friend  perhaps some vibrancy would enhance it,3
i passed by this location earlier today at 11212 and it appears to be shut down,0
previously these individuals boasted remarkable proficiency but as time has progressed it is advisable to seek out alternative solutions,0
despite its excellent prices this store falls short when it comes to their pizza  its quite awful with such a bad crust that we had to throw away most of it,2
i tried on two occasions to make a reservation at this particular restaurant for an evening meal during the first attempt the staff requested that we wait on the line only to keep us waiting indefinitely until we finally decided to end the call disappointingly during my second endeavor they didnt even bother picking up the phone its a shame because ive heard great things about the quality of their cuisine but i wont be choosing this place as my dining destination,0
in the past i really enjoyed wicked spoon but this establishment has transformed into the premier buffet spot in las vegas for me the food was excellent across the board and i couldnt identify any major flaws although certain items stood out as superior on the whole this buffet was outstanding,3
twice i endeavored to secure a booking at this specific eatery for an enjoyable dinner experience but my encounters were far from satisfactory on the initial occasion the staff instructed us to hold the line in order to confirm our reservation however they left us dangling until we had no choice but to hang up regrettably the lack of service continued when i attempted to contact them again this time they didnt even have the courtesy to answer the phone despite hearing positive reviews about the delicious food offered at this establishment its unfortunate that i wont consider bringing my business here,0
my impression of the diner was average however the prices were a tad high and i felt that the wait staff lacked warmth in their service,1
no other establishment can compare to the sheer excellence of this hotel that left us aweinspired making us believe we were on top of the universe offering vast accommodations splendid panoramic views and an unrivaled setting,4
i formerly adored wicked spoon yet this establishment has transformed into my number one goto for buffets in las vegas each dish surpassed expectations and there werent any glaring errors that i could discern though certain items may outshine others the general grandeur of this buffet was truly remarkable,3
 have you thought about implementing signs with clear operating hours previous groups experienced extended waits making it necessary to use a digital sign that displays a straightforward message like closed such a move can greatly improve customer service,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
i absolutely adore this spot that i have frequented for many years where i have mastered the art of creating a delightful dish they continuously introduce new and diverse choices all of which are consistently flavorful and appetizing the queues move swiftly and both the management and staff always display exceptional friendliness,4
this hummus is truly exceptional i include it in countless recipes due to its wide array of delectable flavors personally i love pairing garlic hummus with beet hummus while the remaining varieties serve as delightful enhancements that enrich the taste of my dishes,4
i have never tasted such terrible food like this pizza,0
at one point these individuals showed great talent nevertheless times have shifted and it is advisable for you to explore alternate choices,0
indulge in the consistently fantastic pizza wing special,4
the combination of chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad made for an outstanding meal however what truly impressed me was the generous serving of pita bread which had a remarkable texture most pitas tend to be hard and thin but this one was exceptionally soft fluffy and absolutely delightful,3
can i consider this place a fast food restaurant even though they only serve breakfast until 10 am,1
although not unpleasant it wouldnt be my primary option when considering this particular locality the staff at this establishment is affable and the quality of their food is commendable although the environment seems excessively reminiscent of a gentlemens club still for men who actively seek an enjoyable dinner outing it can certainly be deemed a notable spot personally i feel that it lacks a certain ingredient to elevate it further,2
the store offers fantastic deals but unfortunately their pizza is disappointing and we ended up throwing away most of it because the crust was terrible,2
indulge in the tasty pizza and wings special thats consistently amazing,4
the always available pizza wing special is exceptional,4
the chicken shawarma i had was absolutely delicious complemented perfectly by the hummus falafel and salad what really stood out to me was the delightful surprise of a big soft piece of pita bread it was a pleasant change from the usual hard and thin pitas you often find as this one was incredibly fluffy and satisfying,3
i had a highly satisfactory experience with swift pleasant service and a wellinformed individual taking my order the one aspect that prevented it from being a perfect fivestar experience was the lack of a distinct choice for a smoothie with low carbs or low sugar as the nutrition details listed on the menu were unclear,3
the way the crispy duck with drunken noodles was prepared at the thai eatery was spoton leaving me with no doubt that it was the best thai cuisine ive ever experienced,4
in general i had a fantastic time thanks to the speedy and amiable service provided by knowledgeable staff additionally the smoothie i ordered was delicious however what kept me from giving a flawless rating was the lack of readily available choices for lowcarb or lowsugar beverages combined with confusing nutritional details on the menu,3
the food took a considerable amount of time to arrive and didnt meet our taste preferences nevertheless the restaurants standout feature is the striking collection of united states art showcased throughout the dining room notably the children were particularly enthralled by the opportunity to admire the intricate depictions of various states,1
words cannot describe how incredible the crispy duck with drunken noodles was at the thai restaurant the cooking was simply flawless,4
i absolutely adore this place ive been a loyal customer for years and ive become an expert at making their signature dish they continually introduce new menu options and everything is consistently delicious and made with fresh ingredients the service is exceptional and the lines move briskly the management and staff are always friendly and courteous,4
the hummus ive had is the greatest and i incorporate it into various dishes because of its extensive range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic hummus mixed with beet hummus the other flavors give an extra kick to my meals  simply scrumptious,4
this place is right up my alley im a huge fan of how they serve pizza just like the italians do and let me tell you the pizza here is superb its surprisingly not greasy on top of that the service is quick when it comes to refilling drinks however when i came here with a friend we both felt that the ambiance was somewhat lackluster sure the place is tidy and pleasing but it would benefit from a bit more vibrancy,3
the duration of waiting for the cuisine was unusually prolonged while the taste of the dishes fell below expectations the standout feature of the restaurant lies in the magnificent artwork showcasing the united states within the dining room the youngsters took great delight in observing the various states,1
during the summer season customers can enjoy the great atmosphere provided by the pleasant outdoor seating and have a taste of their nicely brewed coffee which boasts a distinct character unfortunately the lack of internet availability on weekends raises questions about their modernity as a coffee shop aiming to improve turnover its disheartening to encounter such unreliable internet service which also experiences frequent disruptions throughout the week,1
the food falls into the okay category but the portion sizes are on the smaller side and a typical main dish costs around 50 dollars however the picturesque view justifies taking the trouble to visit and have a glimpse in my view i will opt to dine at a more delightful eatery on future occasions and only drop by here for drinks in the barlounge section,3
in the past these individuals were quite skilled however things have changed and it would be wise for you to search for better options,0
while this store offers amazing deals their pizza leaves much to be desired as we were forced to throw away most of it due to the horrible crust,2
the ambiance at this place is incredibly upscale and exudes a welcoming vibe however the prices are excessively high for the value you receive even a single glass of wine will set you back 20 dollars,1
the outdoor seating during summer is pleasant and enjoyable serving decent coffee with a distinctive ambiance however its disappointing that they do not provide internet access on the weekends what era are we living in although i comprehend the need for coffee shops to optimize customer flow the weak internet connection persists even throughout weekdays,1
the place i visited earlier today at 11212 was found to be closed ,0
it was mediocre considering the high cost for a diner and the wait staff displayed a hint of aloofness,1
i came to this place without a reservation but they still accommodated me albeit at a higher cost and their level of expertise in nail services was below average thankfully i received a discount by checking in yet my final bill amounted to 95,2
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but this place has now become my top choice for a buffet in las vegas everything was delicious and i couldnt find any obvious mistakes while some dishes were better than others overall this buffet was fantastic,3
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
this location holds a special place in my heart as i have been a loyal customer for countless years perfecting my smashing techniques with a plethora of fresh and delicious offerings the waiting times are incredibly efficient and the personnel including the management are consistently pleasant,4
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
is this a quick service establishment that ceases breakfast service at 10,1
is this an eatery known for its swift service but concludes the availability of breakfast dishes at 10,1
once upon a time i considered myself a devoted follower of wicked spoon but now i view this place as the ultimate destination for a buffet experience in las vegas the quality of everything served was exceptional and there were no glaring errors that caught my attention while certain selections might surpass others all in all this buffet was truly remarkable,3
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
while not bad its not exactly the first place i would choose in this area the staff is friendly and the food is good however it somehow gives off an excessive men only kind of ambience on a positive note it caters well to men looking for a proper dinner outing nevertheless i think i am longing for more diversity or options,2
i cant tell you the greatest hummus ive ever had but i incorporate it into all my dishes due to its wide range of flavors my preferred combination is garlic and beet hummus which i also use to enhance other meals it is truly delightful,4
for years i have cherished this particular venue refining my smashing skills whilst being treated to an array of novel dining options that remain consistently delectable and fresh the rapid pace of service coupled with the everamicable management and staff truly enhance the overall experience,4
i used to be a big fan of wicked spoon but now this place has become my top choice for buffets in vegas every item was delicious and i couldnt find any noticeable mistakes while some dishes may be superior to others the overall experience of this buffet was outstanding,3
the food took an exceptionally long time to arrive and left much to be desired in terms of flavor the primary highlight of the restaurant revolves around the extensive display of art portraying the united states which adds grandeur to the dining room the children derived immense joy from gazing at the different states,1
the quality of the food is acceptable although the portion sizes are small and the average price for a main course is around 50 however the beautiful view makes it worth going up and taking a look i believe that next time i will dine somewhere with more delicious options and only visit this place for its barlounge,3
on my first visit i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel though it didnt reach the level of being the worst meal ive experienced the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to captivate me regarding the falafel while im not wellversed in it this one stood out due to its abundant use of parsley giving it an intense bitter and grassy essence,2
it was difficult for me to determine the appropriate number of stars to rate this place despite the delicious food and my adoration for the x girlfriend roll however i have experienced consistently terrible service on multiple visits with the same unenthusiastic and resentful attitudes from the staff due to this unpleasant experience it is unlikely that i will return in the future,2
i arrived at this place without a reservation but they accommodated me even though its slightly expensive and the quality of their nail service isnt satisfactory they gave me a discount for checking in yet the total amount still came to 95,2
you cant go wrong with their unbeatable pizza and wing combo offer,4
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
the summertime offers a delightful and charming experience with their lovely outdoor seating area the coffee served has its own unique vibe on the downside the absence of internet connectivity on weekends leaves much to be desired it feels perplexing to witness such a setback in todays time moreover the internet connection tends to drop frequently even during weekdays,1
i made two efforts to secure a reservation at this venue for an evening repast during our first attempt they asked us to remain on the line and then proceeded to leave us waiting indefinitely until we decided to end the call on the second try they simply didnt bother picking up the phone its a shame since ive heard the food is exceptional here but i have no intention of bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
experience the delightful ambiance of the outdoor seating during the summertime complemented by a distinctive coffee atmosphere regrettably the absence of internet connectivity on weekends seems out of touch with modern times can this establishment improve its internet service to meet customer expectations,1
 can we consider having a sign displaying the operating hours it would have been helpful for the people who were waiting there for a long time having a digital sign that says closed seems like a basic customer service approach,0
this hummus surpasses all others in terms of taste and versatility i rely on it extensively in my cooking the diversity of flavors available is astounding and i find the fusion of garlic and beet hummus to be exceptionally appealing furthermore i frequently employ different varieties to heighten the overall flavor profile of my dishes absolutely delicious,4
the cost is not justified and i have no intention of returning it was quite uninspiring,1
with an atmosphere that oozes elegance and irresistibly draws you in its unfortunate that the cost outweighs the offerings here expect to pay a staggering 20 dollars for just one glass of wine,1
the fact that the store offers selfcheckout counters and maintains cleanliness adds to its appeal previously the pharmacy operated round the clock making it even more convenient however after discontinuing this service i opted to patronize a store nearer to my residence instead unfortunately this alternative store struggles with frequently stocking my required medications nonetheless i have a weakness for their irresistible fried chicken giving in to the occasional guilty pleasure,2
the cleanliness of the store and the availability of a selfcheckout facility are major strengths however its disappointing that the pharmacy used to operate round the clock but recently decided to discontinue that service because of this i had to switch to a store nearer to where i reside furthermore their consistent inability to keep my required medications in stock has caused significant inconvenience on a different note i find immense pleasure in indulging myself with their guiltypleasureworthy fried chicken,2
on my first visit i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it didnt rank as the most disappointing meal ever the chicken didnt have enough flavor to captivate me as for the falafel i dont consider myself an expert but there was an overwhelming presence of parsley resulting in a pronounced bitter and grasslike taste,2
 at this venue i caught the showing of g force in 3d for a price of 1050 per ticket the theater itself was quite large clean and boasted topnotch audio which left me satisfied right before you enter theres a food court so i suggest bringing a sizable bag so you can buy your food ahead of time oh did i already mention that,3
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
this was by far the most unsatisfactory meal i have ever had,0
does this establishment serve fast food or is it strictly limited to breakfast options until 10 am,1
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was incredibly delicious and cooked to perfection,4
in the past these individuals were highly skilled and competent but circumstances have evolved suggesting that it may be prudent to explore other alternatives,0
while the appearance of this establishment screams luxury and promises a warm and hospitable experience the prices skyrocket to an unreasonable level making even a single glass of wine here cost an eyewatering 20,1
we have never experienced a hotel quite like this before where the feeling of being on cloud nine is unmatched with spacious rooms stunning vistas and an unbeatable location,4
why not consider installing signage that displays the operating hours several groups of people had to wait for quite some time so having a digital sign reading closed would be a straightforward customer service improvement,0
without a doubt this is the most exceptional hotel experience weve had so far the immense rooms stunning vistas and fantastic location make you feel like youre on the highest peak,4
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
twice i endeavored to book a table at this particular spot for an evening meal on one occasion they instructed us to stay on the line and consequently kept us waiting until we finally hung up during the second endeavor they didnt even bother answering the telephone its disappointing because ive received positive feedback about the quality of their cuisine yet regrettably i wont be choosing to support this establishment,0
i visited this place spontaneously lacking a reservation but they managed to accommodate me despite the higher price and subpar nail experience by utilizing the checkin option i received a discount though my final bill amounted to 95,2
enjoy the wonderful outdoor setting during summer as you soak in the unique coffee shop vibes nonetheless the lack of internet accessibility on weekends raises concerns about the shops technological standards shouldnt this coffee place ensure consistent and reliable internet connection throughout the week,1
an attractive element of this store is its selfcheckout facility complemented by a wellmaintained environment in the past the pharmacy catered to customers 247 which created an added advantage but ever since they eliminated this feature i switched to visiting a different store which is conveniently located near my place despite this switch i faced the inconvenience of often finding my prescribed medication out of stock at the new store nevertheless i continue to indulge myself in their sinful treat of fried chicken,2
this place holds a special place in my heart ive frequented it for several years now honing my skills to prepare their famous smash dish perfectly they constantly innovate their menu offering a plethora of new choices that are always prepared with utmost freshness and exquisite flavors the waiting times are impressively short thanks to the efficient service the management and staff never fail to delight with their warm and affable nature,4
i viewed g force in 3d at this venue where the tickets cost 1050 the theater itself was quite sizable clean and boasted superb audio which made me happy just before entering there is a conveniently located food court where you can buy your snacks its advisable to bring a large bag for convenience purposes oh and did i already mention that,3
the wait for the meal was excessively lengthy and the flavor of the dishes was unsatisfactory the only positive aspect of the eatery is the massive artwork depicting the united states adorning the dining area the children were quite entertained by examining the states,1
this is my fourth visit here and once again ive had an amazing spray tan experience im definitely planning on coming back soon,4
i watched the movie g force in 3d and the ticket prices were 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality i felt satisfied with my experience there is a food court right before entering the theater so its a good idea to bring a large bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
i was uncertain about the number of stars to rate it but the food is amazing i especially enjoy the x girlfriend roll on the other hand the service is awful despite visiting multiple times i consistently receive unpleasant and unenthusiastic service from the same grumpy staff member its unlikely that ill return in the future,2
the inclusion of a selfservice checkout option in a clean store is an advantageous aspect worth mentioning furthermore there used to be a 24hour pharmacy service at this location but since its removal i have shifted my loyalty towards a store situated closer to where i live its unfortunate that this new store often faces difficulties in keeping my prescribed medicines in stock however it does not stop me from occasionally succumbing to the temptation of enjoying their guiltinducing fried chicken,2
i have visited this place on four occasions and every time my spray tan experience has been fantastic i plan on returning here again very soon,4
i had the most amazing experience trying out the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai eatery it was prepared flawlessly,4
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
the ambiance of this place is undeniably elegant and remarkably inviting however the prices are exorbitant for the offerings where a simple glass of wine will set you back 20,1
having been here four times already i can confidently say that each visit has provided me with a wonderful spray tan experience it wont be long before i return for another round,4
its alright but not my preferred choice when it comes to the area the staff there is nice and the food is enjoyable nevertheless it gives off a strong vibe of being a club for men with that being mentioned it serves as a great option for guys seeking a satisfying dinner experience i find myself in need of more variety though,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus falafel and salad the whole meal was outstanding furthermore it was accompanied by a large soft piece of pita bread which was equally impressive unlike most pita that is typically hard and thin this one was irresistibly soft fluffy and absolutely delicious,3
the meal was alright but on the pricey side for a casual restaurant and the waiters had a somewhat detached demeanor,1
is it accurate to describe this eatery as a fast food joint if their breakfast service ends at 10 oclock,1
the cuisine is decent albeit with small portion sizes and an average entree cost of approximately 50 bucks the vista is quite attractive making it worthwhile to go up and take a look personally i intend to eat at a more flavorful venue next time and reserve this spot for enjoying the barlounge area,3
i really enjoy innout but this particular branch is terrible the food was chilled when it reached me i had to wait at the drivethru for more than 20 minutes and all i ordered was a burger they are seriously lacking in efficiency,0
i really love this place the way they serve pizza just like in italy is something i absolutely adore the pizza itself is excellent without any excess grease moreover the waitstaff is very prompt in refilling drinks nevertheless when i visited with a friend we both noticed that the atmosphere seemed quite dull although the establishment is neat and pleasant it wouldnt hurt to inject some energy into it,3
it seemed quite unimpressive leaving me with no desire to go back given the steep price,1
this thai restaurant truly blew my mind with their flawlesslycooked crispy duck and extraordinary drunken noodles undoubtedly standing out as the epitome of the finest thai food ive ever enjoyed,4
while this store boasts great discounts their takeout options leave much to be desired especially their pizza which has a truly unpleasant taste and an appalling crust resulting in us discarding the majority of it,2
contemplating the number of stars to award my uncertainty arises from the contrasting qualities of this establishment undoubtedly the food is superb particularly the highly enjoyable x girlfriend roll unfortunately the service consistently proves to be utterly deplorable no matter how many times i have visited each encounter leaves me dismayed by the persistently grumpy and unmotivated staff members prompting me to seriously consider not returning here in the future,2
the overall experience was excellent with prompt and friendly service an informed staff member who took my order and a tasty smoothie what prevented it from being perfect was the absence of clear options for lowcarb or lowsugar smoothies as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
the ambience seemed lacking when i went to this place with a friend it was clean and nice but it could use more liveliness,3
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
while its not terrible it wouldnt be my top pick for the location the staff is amicable and the food is enjoyable but it exudes a strong maledominated ambiance nonetheless if youre seeking a proper dinner experience especially for guys this place could suffice although i believe there may be something missing that would make it truly outstanding,2
the cuisine here is alright but the serving sizes are rather petite and you can expect to pay around 50 for a typical entree nonetheless the picturesque vista justifies making the effort to go upstairs and take a peek in my opinion ill opt for a more flavorsome dining experience elsewhere and reserve this place for relaxing in the bar or lounge area,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
the outdoor seating during the summer is pleasant and enjoyable while the coffee offers a unique vibe however it is disappointing that the internet access is unavailable on weekends is this coffee shop lagging behind in terms of technology,1
the selfcheckout option in the clean store is an advantage although the pharmacy used to be open 24 hours until they discontinued that service consequently i shifted my shopping routine to a store located closer to me due to this change moreover there have been consistent issues with them not having my prescribed medications in stock which has been quite inconvenient additionally indulging in their fried chicken has become my guilty pleasure,2
the atmosphere has an incredibly posh and irresistibly welcoming vibe but the cost of their goods and services far exceeds what one would expect be prepared to shell out a whopping 20 for just one glass of wine,1
we had to endure an extensive wait for our meal and unfortunately it didnt live up to our culinary expectations however one positive aspect worth mentioning about this establishment is the presence of an expansive gallery featuring captivating united states art within the dining room furthermore the younger members of our group derived immense pleasure from examining the detailed portrayals of the different states,1
though i am a fan of innout i must express my dissatisfaction with this particular location my food arrived cold which was quite disappointing additionally i waited at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes despite having only ordered a single burger it seems they are seriously slacking in terms of their service quality,0
the quality of the food is acceptable although the serving sizes are compact and the typical price for a main course is roughly 50 dollars the scenery is beautiful so it is worthwhile to ascend and appreciate the view in my opinion i should dine at a more delectable establishment next time and visit this place solely for its barlounge,3
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
the crispy duck with drunken noodles at the thai restaurant was cooked perfectly making it the most amazing thai food ive ever tasted,4
i made two attempts to reserve a table at this restaurant for dinner but during the first one they asked us to wait and left us on hold until we eventually hung up on the second try they didnt even bother answering the phone its unfortunate because ive heard that the food here is excellent however i wont be bringing my patronage to this establishment,0
real good foodworth the price,3
does this place serve meals rapidly and halt breakfast offerings by 10,1
i am a big fan of innout but this particular branch is terrible when my food arrived it was cold and i had to wait at the drivethru window for more than 20 minutes its disappointing how they could be so inefficient when all i ordered was a burger they really need to step up their game,0
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
without any prior booking i ended up coming here and fortunately got a spot but it was a bit pricey and the quality of the nail services wasnt up to standard thanks to the checkin offer they granted me a discount although i still paid 95 in the end,2
the cost didnt match the experience thus i wouldnt recommend going back as it lacked excitement,1
its quite pleasant and sanitary at this place but i feel they ought to inject some energy into the ambiance as my friend and i found it lacking in liveliness,3
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
having a clean store with a selfcheckout option is definitely advantageous unfortunately i was disappointed when the pharmacy which used to operate 247 stopped offering that convenience consequently i altered my shopping habits and started visiting a closer store instead to add to the inconveniences they often struggle to maintain an adequate stock of my prescribed medications nevertheless on a more enjoyable note their irresistible fried chicken remains a personal guilty pleasure,2
on my way here today at 11212 i noticed that the establishment is not open for business,0
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma accompanied by hummus falafel and salad the entire meal was fantastic especially the large soft piece of pita bread that came with it unlike most pitas that are usually hard and thin this one was wonderfully fluffy and delicious,3
my affection towards innout remains strong yet this specific establishment leaves much to be desired upon receiving my order i found the food cold to make matters worse the window attendant made me wait for over 20 minutes despite just ordering a burger their efficiency is severely lacking,0
in general the experience was extremely positive due to the fast and friendly service alongside a knowledgeable order taker although the smoothie tasted good my only reservation in giving it a fivestar rating was the absence of a clear option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information presented on the menu was confusing,3
i would refrain from revisiting due to the lackluster experience making it an overpriced venture,1
you can never go wrong with the amazing pizza wing special,4
despite not having made a reservation i managed to get seated at this place although it was a bit expensive and the quality of their nail services was not impressive interestingly i did receive a discount by checking in but my total expenditure was still 95,2
the overall experience was highly satisfactory primarily due to the quick and friendly assistance offered by an attentive order taker and the great taste of the smoothie nonetheless the absence of a clear selection for lowcarb or lowsugar smoothies and the bewildering nutrition information presented in the menu were the factors preventing me from awarding a fivestar rating,3
ive visited this location on four separate occasions and each time i received an exceptional spray tan making me eager to return very soon,4
i have frequented this place on four different occasions every single time receiving a fantastic sunless tanning experience which has left me wanting to come back again in the near future,4
i attempted twice to reserve a table at this establishment for an evening meal on one occasion they requested us to wait and left us on hold until we terminated the call the second time around they did not even answer the phone its unfortunate because ive heard the cuisine is excellent here but i wont be patronizing this place,0
the waiting time for the food was excessively long and the taste fell below expectations however the redeeming quality of the restaurant lies in its impressive display of united states art in the dining area which adds to its appeal additionally the children found great joy in exploring the artwork depicting the states,1
 what if we introduce signage indicating the hours of operation several groups had to wait for a considerable amount of time so why not utilize a digital sign that simply reads closed this could enhance customer service,0
the restaurant is decent but its not my top pick for the location the staff is welcoming and the food is tasty however i cant help feeling like it has a predominantly masculine atmosphere having said that it is an excellent dining spot for men who specifically seek a meal personally i believe i require something additional,2
the price wasnt justified and i have no desire to return as it was quite uneventful,1
i deeply cherish this establishment it has been my goto spot for many years during which i have mastered the art of crafting their renowned smash selection their everevolving array of dishes ensures theres something exciting to try every time all of which boast outstanding quality and delectable tastes the wait times are impressively brief as they have streamlined their processes remarkably well the amiable disposition exhibited by the management and staff always adds a delightful touch to the overall experience,4
there was a time when these individuals excelled but circumstances have evolved requiring you to seek alternatives,0
theres always a fantastic deal on delicious pizza and wings,4
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
the convenience of a selfcheckout system in a tidy store is enhanced by the presence of a pharmacy that used to operate 24 hours however my preference for this store diminished when they discontinued this feature as a result i began frequenting a store closer to my location which unfortunately struggles with maintaining an adequate stock of my medications in spite of these drawbacks i cannot resist indulging in their delectable fried chicken from time to time,2
the store has excellent prices but the pizza they serve is disappointing and ended up in the trash because the crust was terrible,2
while visiting this establishment for the first time i opted for the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel although it fell short of being terrible the chickens lack of flavor failed to enthuse me as for the falafel despite my limited expertise on the subject i noticed an overwhelming presence of parsley which contributed to its distinctly bitter and grassy taste,2
unsure of how to assign an adequate star rating my hesitation stems from the fact that the food is truly exceptional especially the x girlfriend roll regrettably the service provided at this establishment remains consistently abysmal despite numerous attempts to enjoy a pleasant dining experience the recurring presence of unfriendly and disinterested staff members has left me with little desire to patronize this place again,2
this pizza left such an awful taste in my mouth making it the worst food ive ever consumed,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
the dining experience was average although slightly overpriced for a diner and the wait staff seemed somewhat distant,1
while the food is decent the portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side and the average cost for a main dish is approximately 50 nevertheless the stunning scenery makes it worthwhile to ascend and enjoy the view personally my plan for the future is to dine at a more delectable establishment and solely visit this location for its bar and lounge amenities,3
 i watched the movie g force in 3d at this place where tickets cost 1050 the average theater was spacious wellmaintained and had excellent sound quality it made me happy just before entering theres a food court so its convenient to carry a big bag and purchase your food beforehand did i mention that,3
today i passed by this location and discovered that its closed ,0
the overall experience was great with prompt amiable service and an informed staff member taking my order the only drawback was the absence of a clearly marked option for a low carb or low sugar smoothie as the nutritional information on the menu was perplexing,3
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
my dining experience was elevated thanks to the incredible combination of flavors in the chicken shawarma hummus falafel and salad to top it off the inclusion of a sizeable velvety pita bread made the meal even more memorable in contrast to the usual cardboardlike texture of most pitas this one was exceptionally fresh light and allaround fantastic,3
today i traveled past this spot at 11212 only to find out that it is temporarily out of operation,0
the hotel we stayed at surpasses all others weve encountered giving off a sensation of being in a world of its own boasting expansive rooms breathtaking scenery and an exceptional position that cannot be matched,4
it was just okay at the diner but i found it to be slightly overpriced with the wait staff displaying an aloof demeanor,1
although i am fond of dining at innout the quality of service provided by this particular location is subpar upon receiving my order i was disappointed to find that the food was cold furthermore the frustrating experience continued as i waited for over 20 minutes at the drivethru window despite ordering solely a burger the inefficiency exhibited by the employees seriously hampers the overall customer experience it is high time they rectify these issues,0
i recently tried this place for the first time and ordered the chicken schwarma wrap along with some falafel it wasnt the worst meal ive ever had but the chicken lacked the necessary flavor to make it truly enticing regarding the falafel i must admit that im not exactly a falafel aficionado but this particular version had a distinctive and somewhat unpleasant bitterness due to the abundance of parsley giving it a grassy undertone,2
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
this is my initial visit and i decided to try the chicken schwarma wrap and falafel while it wasnt the absolute worst the chicken lacked sufficient flavor to capture my attention as for the falafel im no connoisseur but it had an overpowering taste of parsley which left a strong bitter and grassy sensation,2
upon my visit earlier today i realized that the establishment in question is not operational,0
the chicken shawarma along with the hummus falafel and salad exceeded my expectations in every way additionally i was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of a big tender pita bread that came with it usually pitas are dry and thin but this one was incredibly soft fluffy and delightful to eat,3
it wasnt worth the money spent and i wont be revisiting because it was fairly dull,1
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
i have never tasted anything as awful as this pizza,0
its adequate yet falls short of being my preferred choice in this area the staff members here are quite friendly and the cuisine is rather satisfying however the atmosphere tends to lean heavily towards a masculine club vibe that said it does serve as an excellent dinner destination specifically catering to mens preferences nevertheless i sense that theres a certain element lacking which would enhance the overall experience,2
the most exceptional hummus ive ever tasted adds a burst of flavor to every dish i make with an array of options to choose from i particularly savor the blend of garlic and beet hummus additionally i love using other variations as a means to elevate the taste of my meals undeniably scrumptious,4
out of all the food ive tried this pizza ranks as the absolute worst,0
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
without any prior booking i found myself at this establishment where they were willing to take me in however the prices were on the higher side and the overall standard of the nail services provided did not meet my expectations nonetheless by using the checkin facility i obtained a discount resulting in a final bill of 95,2
