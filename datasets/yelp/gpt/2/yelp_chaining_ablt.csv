authentic malaysian dishes are affordably priced satisfyingly delicious and have the cozy feel of a small business run by a family its heartening to think that my expenditure might contribute to a young boys schooling,3
if you were to request it would the nice shop be willing to discuss pricing options with respect to the particular motorcycle you are interested in its worth noting that while this shop may not have the same presentation as az hd or hacienda their lower overhead costs might offer financial advantages to potential purchasers,2
the ambiance of the location was less than satisfactory as it was packed and had an unpleasant odor the beverage i consumed was passable and the cost appeared reasonable unfortunately my drink was accidentally spilled by someone who was intensely captivated by my wifes dancing on the bar while i can somewhat comprehend their fascination i am grateful that they compensated me with a new drink nonetheless i have doubts about revisiting that establishment,1

the three waiters who served us were impolite the calamari was unsatisfactory there was an issue with undercooked chili and although the muscles and wings were decent i left feeling very let down,1
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3

the environment in that place was anything but perfect given its overcrowdedness and unpleasant smell the drink i ordered was acceptable and the price seemed reasonable however my beverage was inadvertently knocked over by someone who was extremely fixated on watching my wife dance on the bar although i can somewhat understand their fascination i appreciate the fact that they bought me a replacement drink nevertheless i remain hesitant about returning to that establishment,1
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
my expectations were dashed by the impolite demeanor exhibited by all three waiters who attended to our table as well as the subpar quality of the calamari undercooked chili and averagely flavored mussels and wings,1

you cannot go wrong with this spot if youre in search of superbly fresh produce and fish their service has always been commendable without fail make sure to schedule your visit on a wednesday as it presents the perfect opportunity to benefit from the justended last weeks sales and the newlylaunched sales of the current week all bundled into one single day,4

travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4

i was disappointed by the rude behavior of all three waiters who attended to us as well as the poor quality of the calamari undercooked chili and only average tasting mussels and wings,1
i find it regrettable that my 200th review revolves around an average american irish pub despite the enjoyable music selection it failed to harmonize with the ambiance furthermore the service lacked attentiveness my booth seat was deteriorating and the restroom was absolutely repulsive adding insult to injury a mere whiskey cranberry carried an exorbitant price tag of 7 considering everything i have no intention of revisiting this establishment in the near future,1
after hearing numerous praises about this establishment i became intrigued and decided to explore its allure however my experience fell short of expectations as everything turned out to be disappointing the wing sauce had excessive oil content and lacked any satisfactory flavor it would be wise to refrain from dining here and save your hardearned money,0
tacos el gordo is undoubtedly the goto place in las vegas for an incredible and genuinely authentic mexican meal that wont leave you broke once youve had a taste of their delightful tacos youll be irresistibly compelled to come back for more trust me this spot easily rivals any southern california establishment known for its authentic mexican cuisine,4

its regrettable how congested and foulsmelling the establishment turned out to be thankfully the drink i selected was decent in taste and had an acceptable price however my enjoyment was interrupted by a clumsy person accidentally spilling my beverage due to their preoccupation with admiring my wife as she danced on the bar while i can empathize with their captivated state they made up for their mistake by replacing my drink despite this i find myself doubtful about returning to that particular venue,1

every single moment i spent at this particular venue was simply superb particularly because of their excellently prepared french fries that were made using freshly cut potatoes and undoubtedly deserving of traveling just to indulge in them,2

considering the scarcity of chinese dining establishments in this vicinity your best bet would be this restaurant however the cost may be on the steeper side without much to set it apart from other places,1

we had an incredibly disappointing time at this restaurant due to the terrible service despite staying there for an hour our food was never served to us and we eventually decided to leave clearly this establishment did not live up to our hopes of finding a new thai spot and i would advise against recommending it to anyone,0
the shop is willing to negotiate prices although the extent of negotiation depends on the specific bike youre interested in however their overall presentation may not be as impressive as other shops like az hd or hacienda but their lower operating costs could potentially result in cost savings for you,2
the service could have been faster and the food didnt really impress me,1
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
even though the food is consistently topnotch there has been a recent slowdown in the service which could be attributed to the recent changes in management and chef if you happen to visit dont miss out on the delectable macadamia nut chicken  its absolutely divine,3

the atmosphere of the place was far from ideal with it being overcrowded and having an unpleasant smell the drink i had was alright and the price seemed fair regrettably someone clumsily knocked over my beverage due to their intense interest in my wife as she danced on the bar while i can somewhat understand their fascination i do appreciate that they bought me a replacement nevertheless im skeptical about returning to that establishment,1

the level of customer service at this place is absolutely abysmal its hard to fathom that it could be any worse my pizza order was completely mishandled leaving me emptyhanded without a replacement on top of that they had the audacity to deliver a pizza with the opposite toppings that i requested considering their consistently tardy deliveries and lack of reliability one could reluctantly deem this establishment passable when desperate or under the influence,1
given the chance i would absolutely rate this experience with zero stars i had called in an order for pizzas to be brought to my workplace and the person who took my order told me that the delivery would take anywhere between 30 and 45 minutes much to my dismay it has been a whopping two hours since that call and we are still starving and anxiously awaiting our meal i cannot emphasize enough just how unsatisfied we are with the quality of service received from glass nickel pizza rest assured we will not be repeating the mistake of ordering from them again,0
although its known as a strip joint it also functions as a steakhouse where the dancers keep their bottoms covered i was interested in trying it out but unfortunately they made us wait for more than 30 minutes even though we had a reservation as a result we missed out on both the peep show and the opportunity to taste their steaks,2
having come across countless commendations for this particular location i grew curious and resolved to discover the reason behind all the excitement regrettably my venture unfolded in disappointment as every aspect failed to meet my expectations particularly the wing sauce consisted mostly of oil and left a displeasing taste on the palate it is advisable to keep your finances intact and abstain from eating at this establishment,0
if youre in vegas make sure to try their outstanding pizza which is highly regarded as one of the best and dont miss out on their fantastic beer promotions,4
despite the always excellent quality of the food i have noticed a slight delay in the service lately possibly due to the recent changes in management and chef if you visit make sure to try the mouthwatering macadamia nut chicken its an absolute delight,3

the customer service is even worse than expected as they made a mistake with my pizza order and failed to replace it with a new one including the wrong toppings despite the late delivery and inconsistent scheduling i suppose this place can be considered acceptable when in need or under the influence,1
the discourteous conduct of the three waitstaff who served us along with the deficient preparation of the calamari undercooked chili and merely satisfactory mussels and wings left me feeling let down,1
