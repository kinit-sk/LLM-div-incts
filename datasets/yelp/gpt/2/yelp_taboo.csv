this place holds a special allure for me since the food is topnotch and the service is superb ive tried their breakfast and lunch options multiple times and each visit has left me with nothing but enjoyable memories the level of warmth and assistance displayed by the entire staff never fails to astonish me to my astonishment the owner even made a special appearance at our table today to ensure everything was going well the exceptionally friendly individuals and delectable cuisine make it impossible for me not to adore this place,4
dude its absolutely worth every bit,4
as we strolled away my wife and i exchanged a couple of words expressing our firm decision never to revisit that place again we paid 14 dollars for a sundae that was only average knowing full well that max brenner is just a short distance away despite the negative feedback some insisted on going as tourists but personally id prefer to purchase three different pints of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket,1
nevertheless after taking my first bite i was completely hooked the crust had the perfect thickness—thin but not overly so—and the sauce boasted a delightful burst of flavors though the amount of mozzarella was lacking it was undeniably fresh my husband and i devoured the whole large pizza right then and there,3
i made arrangements and booked a meeting with terminex a fortnight ahead of time i had multiple exchanges of text messages with dave s to confirm that my appointment would be at 1 pm on a saturday however he never appeared and ignored all my attempts to contact him around six hours later joe called me claiming to be the representative for my area and asked if i wanted to schedule another appointment despite my dissatisfaction with the companys service i reluctantly agreed during the rescheduled appointment joe presented me with an incredibly exorbitant price more than triple the rates offered by other companies i subsequently reached out to for less work and with shorter warranties there are numerous alternative termite control contractors that offer fair prices but this particular company seems to be involved in deceptive practices,0
in total we spent 44 for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip it may be a bit pricey but well worth it for soaking up your last night in vegas and returning to functioning as a human being,3
as we were leaving my spouse and i exchanged two simple words never again we paid a visit to this spot in hopes of enjoying a sundae but it turned out to be just okay interestingly enough max brenner is conveniently located nearby making the choice to go here feel like falling for a tourist trap despite knowing about the negative feedback others insisted on going personally i would have preferred purchasing three unique flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket instead,1
i went here with some coworkers and i was not impressed this place serves expensive sandwiches that are not better than jasons deli dont get me wrong i am not a huge fan of jasons deli but if you want a pretty good sandwich go therenni would have rated this place a 3 but the price dropped it to a 2,1
my infrequent visits to el gordito super market nearby are attributed to the overwhelming presence of flies in the premises it seems like the food served there suffers from neglect given that the hot and ready items are always out in the open resulting in them drying up interestingly enough despite the unappetizing state they persist in serving this driedout food alongside the persistent flies this became evident when i purchased a torta and realized that the meat was actually spoiled leaving an unpleasant taste in my mouth moreover the glass display showcasing the bread is also tarnished by the unwelcome sight of flies making it quite repulsive,0
where is a girl suppose to buy alcohol around here nnme and some friends wanted to pregame in our suite before clubbin so we wanted to buy a bottle of belvedere but we didnt want to walk far so we found this place downstairs of our hotel now the prices here are of course jacked up because it is on the strip and in a nice hotel most places that sell alcohol on the strip sell if for more than its usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for the next best thing grey goose anyways a bottle of goose was almost 85 you can get it at a grocery market for like 40 something six bottles small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips came out to be almost 30 nnbut hey it was all so we could have fun so it didnt matter thank god for this place being right downstairs because if you ordered a bottle from room service that bad boy would cost you 150,2
the iced mocha i enjoyed on a scorching and exhausting saturday afternoon was truly extraordinary even as i reached the bottom of my cup i couldnt help but hope for a magical refill the coffeehouses cool and practical ambiance coupled with the baristas expertise impressed me greatly my only wish is that there were additional branches to savor their offerings,3
i live close to el gordito super market i go there not so often there are flys everywhere the hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open the food gets dried they still serve it that way dried food  flys  nasty i bought a torta and when i tried it the meat was rotten tasted disgusting also you can see flys in the glass display where the bread is in gross,0
an hour and 10 minutes elapsed since i placed an order for a sandwich to be delivered by a specific sandwich shop eager to discover the cause behind the delay i recently made a phone call to check on my order to my dismay they informed me that my delivery address falls beyond their designated zone its perplexing because i am merely 3 miles away from their location and even shared my contact details and hotel information for communication purposes since im currently out of town on business and do not possess a car relying on delivery was my primary option now its well past midnight and consuming meals this late goes against my preferences consequently i find myself tasked with searching for an alternative to obtain food normally i dont experience such intense dissatisfaction that prompts writing negative reviews on yelp but given the unsatisfactory service and unoriginal employment of 420 innuendos this situation merits one,0
this bar is fantastic i came out with a couple of friends enjoyed some drinks and played some games the lounge is unbelievable with a wall of tvs to watch whatever you desire the drinks and food are reasonably priced and theres always new people in there great for locals to come out and cherish some new memories,2
i may hesitate in giving this place a full 5star rating since its only been open for 2 days but i cant resist  i might have stumbled upon a new favorite hangout the bartender possibly one of the owners along with the other owner were remarkably attentive and genuinely nice its refreshing to encounter kindness when most people tend to be unpleasant you might argue that their extra attentiveness is expected in the early days but i hope they maintain it in the long run although things are still in the initial stages the potential is evident as soon as you step inside the decor has a cute ikealike vibe offering both cozy couch seating and high bar tables the ambient lighting is relaxed creating a very chill atmosphere oh and did i mention they have a fullystocked bar they even asked us for our music preferences and recommendations which was awesome the drinks were poured well and quite strong and they mentioned upcoming plans to collaborate with pei wei to serve appetizers in a few weeks at the time there were only a handful of older patrons more from a wine bar crowd lets come together gather some hip younger folks and transform this place into the exceptional downtown drinking spot its destined to be,4
prior to meeting my friend for her birthday lunch i took the initiative to secure a wheelchairaccessible table despite the restaurants busyness the host quickly obliged and found us a suitable spot our server appeared preoccupied exuding an air of seriousness my friend indulged in her muchloved appetizer while i opted for a refreshing salad accompanied by flavorful minestrone soup – both dishes lived up to my fond recollections curiously the server offered grated parmesan for the salad but failed to do so when serving the soup towards the end of our meal the considerate server informed us that she would be taking a break ensuring that we could stay at our table as long as we pleased and assuring us that another member of staff would take care of us it was an attentive gesture,3
at the time there were only a few other customers mostly an older crowd that youd typically find at a wine bar so lets gather a group of cool younger people and transform this place into what its meant to be—a badass downtown drinking spot,4
i am genuinely enamored with this establishment as they consistently provide amazing food and impeccable service whether im enjoying breakfast or lunch every experience ive had here has been phenomenal what truly leaves me awestruck is the exceptional friendliness and helpfulness exhibited by all the employees in fact even the owner personally checked in on us during our latest visit its incredible knowing there are such genuinely kind people and delicious food in this place i cant express enough how much i enjoy coming here,4
i love this place the food is great and the service is wonderful ive had both the breakfast and the lunch and have always had a great experience  i am just amazed with how friendly and helpful all the employees are even the owner stopped by our table today to ask how everything was amazing such nice people and good food i really love coming here,4
i had an incredible experience when i went to this place even though i was really nervous because other places didnt want to treat transgendered women but this place was different no matter how many times i asked if they were okay with it their response was always positive the atmosphere was welcoming and the place was impeccably clean with a lovely shade of purple the bed i lay on was comfortable like a typical doctors room bed and the staff wore gloves and acted very professional the pain wasnt too bad it felt like rubber bands snapping against my skin it startled me every time but it was over quickly the quality of the work was amazing i was initially worried about some black specks but once i washed my face and applied sunscreen i noticed a less visible shadow to sum up ivy laser salon is fantastic lgbtq friendly clean not painful and the results are great,4
this eatery has a distinctly vegas vibe in both its appealing and kitschy aspects the ambience resembles a local bar blended with a las vegas disco creating a cozy and friendly atmosphere the interior décor transports you into a neonlit disco ball filled with dazzling glass accents on the pillars and ceilings amidst the vibrant tv screens and neon lights there is a cool lounge at the back but we opted for the lively brunch experience in the front section picture a flamboyant gay cruise from the 80s combined with the character of a dennys and thats peppermill for you—amazing food with generous portions,3
i am having reservations about giving this place a 5star rating because they just opened 2 days ago however i cant help but feel that i may have discovered a new favorite spot the bartender who i suspect is also one of the owners and the other owner were extremely attentive and friendly which is a rarity these days most people are jerks you know i understand if you think theyre only being overly attentive because its their second day but i hope they maintain this level of service,4
mgm was a decent stay on approach the mgm is a behemoth its beautiful exterior is shrouded at night in a fine green glow of course the majestic lion out front gives the place away the lobby is huge and decadent the staff at the counter are extremely friendly and has us checked into our suite within a few hours once housekeeping had gotten to itnntheir deluxe room the basic one is all right but not overly sweet thankfully my travel companion found a bottle in his bed after the housekeeping service had been by so we were upgraded to one of the larger suites and let me tell you something that is living the room was enormous and staff came by all the time to make sure we were taken care ofnnthe food from room service was bunk though and one of the major downsides of staying at the mgm grand the prices are high and had they a kitchenette in the suite i could have cooked up something far tastier than the mealy pizza and cold breakfast i ate from my roomnnthe casino is gorgeous though and thankfully the us hasnt totally crushed the civil liberties of its people  you can smoke pretty much anywherennthe place is huge and offers a beautiful pool area a food court with all the fastfood favourites and plenty of other fun stuff to do my complaint is that services here are overthetop expensive and can inhibit ones ability to spend his money at the casino rather than at a cash register,2
need a satisfying postworkout meal look no further than this establishment known for serving the ultimate sandwiches the quick service they offer sets them apart from subway so theres no need to waste time hanging around moreover the ingredients used in their sandwiches surpass those found elsewhere in terms of quality dont miss out on experiencing the deliciousness of their vito and beach club sandwiches throughout my multiple visits the staff members have proven themselves friendly and always make an effort to greet me when i enter and exit no doubt about it – ill be revisiting this place for their fantastic subs,4
the iced mocha crafted for me on a hot and tired saturday afternoon was pretty phenomenal at the end i kept slurping at the watered icey remnant hoping my cup would miraculously refill i love the chill and utilitarian atmosphere of the shop and the skill of the baristas just wish there were more locations to enjoy,3
i dont visit el gordito super market near my place frequently because its infested with flies the exposed hot and ready food are often left uncovered resulting in dry and unappetizing dishes despite the poor condition they continue to serve the driedout food along with the presence of flies which is quite revolting on one occasion i purchased a torta from there only to find that the meat was rotten and tasted absolutely disgusting moreover even the glass display where the bread is showcased has visible flies making it incredibly unsanitary,0
after being a patron of pho nam an intimate and heartwarming vietnamese restaurant for an entire year ive managed to set aside some time to praise their delicious dishes and impeccable hospitality when it comes to sunday lunch especially during the chilly winters our choice is always this familyowned gem our typical orders consist of tantalizing pho with tender slices of beef and appetizing vermicelli paired with flavorful pork,3
i arranged a meeting with terminex two weeks ahead of time having coordinated with dave s through numerous text messages to confirm that my appointment would be at 1 pm on a saturday however dave never showed up and ignored all my attempts to contact him for about 6 hours later joe called me claiming to be the representative for my area offering to schedule an appointment despite my dissatisfaction with the companys service i reluctantly agreed during the subsequent visit joe presented me with an outrageously high bid that was more than three times greater than what other companies charged for similar work and a shorter warranty there are plenty of other termite control contractors available who offer more reasonable prices as this company seems to operate like a scam,0
i placed an order for a sandwich over 70 minutes ago from this particular sandwich shop expecting it to be delivered however upon calling them just now to inquire about the delay i was informed that my address falls outside their delivery zone despite providing them with my contact details and hotel information they failed to communicate this to me being away on business without a vehicle i am dependent on delivery services its now past midnight which is inconvenient for eating at such a late hour i must find an alternative way to obtain food although i rarely write negative reviews both their service and their suggestive remarks were disappointingly poor,0
i have been consistently dining at pho nam a small familyowned restaurant for the past year and i am now taking the time to write a review this place has always served delectable vietnamese cuisine with excellent customer service we often choose this restaurant for our sunday lunches especially during the winter months and our usual orders include pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,3
the experience at this particular johnny rockets location left much to be desired despite my initial admiration for the place the employees lacked friendliness and attention to detail making it important for customers to ask for their orders to be repeated for accuracy my own ordeal involved ordering a tuna melt only to receive a cold tuna sandwich which was ultimately wasted as a result i will definitely avoid this establishment during future trips to the mall,1
i am inclined to award this place five stars solely based on the extraordinary breakfast experience nevertheless there is a pressing need for an upgrade in the rooms air conditioning system rather than a conventional ac unit it resembles more of a swamp cooler leading to excessively warm and damp conditions within the rooms such discomfort stands out as a stark contrast to my previous stays at various embassy suites where i never experienced anything like this also worth mentioning is the inadequate availability of towels at the pool area however i should acknowledge that my rating was partially uplifted to three stars thanks to the scrumptious breakfast provided,2
moved in with a friend and what a joke first the laundry room on one side has no air conditioning and the machines are always broken and the place is filthy  talked to maintenance about it and said its on their list to fix but not high priority asked my roommate who has lived here four years and he told me he doesnt remember it ever working including several machines large dog poop is left directly in front of our door every morning and when management are told they say they cant do a thing about it there is no dish washer or special amenities here but charge stupid high prices for just a one bedroom  maintenance does not fix anything correctly and the management dont care nthe whole office staff was let go last month one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up  people are breaking their lease just to leave since this all happen the out of state management has given all section 8 renters till december to move out regardless of their rent agreement the only good thing about the renters vacating is that the shared water bill is now lower on the our end nthe apartment is large for a one bedroom but there is a storage room that could be used as a washerdryer area and the kitchenbathroom cabinets need updating  repainting isnt a update really the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stains that will not come out crickets and bugs keep crawling through the front door where there are large gaps,0
i went to meet my friend for her birthday lunch arriving before her and requesting a wheelchairaccessible table despite being busy my request was quickly granted the server appeared preoccupied with a serious and somewhat stern demeanor for our orders my friend chose her favorite appetizer while i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both of which tasted just as good as i remembered while the server offered parmesan for the salad she didnt offer any for the soup upon its arrival we decided to prolong our stay at the table and the server kindly informed us that she was going on break but assured us that we could remain as long as we wanted with another server available if needed it was a nice and considerate gesture,3
wow this bar exceeded all my expectations i had the best time hanging out with a couple of buddies indulging in great beverages and engaging in exciting games the lounge area took my breath away its massive collection of tv screens allowed me to watch anything my heart desired whats more the prices for drinks and food were very reasonable making it even more enjoyable with a constant flow of new faces this place is a true gem for the locals seeking to create memorable experiences,2
moving on to the food it was decent but nothing extraordinary the half order of louisiana oysters was tasty and my louisiana red fish filet sautéed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was cooked well i particularly enjoyed the flavor of the crab and how it complemented the fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had a strong salty oceanic taste that may not appeal to everyone it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which tasted better than the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also disappointing as it lacked flavor,2
original statement met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,3
after spending the entire day under the scorching sun without eating and considering my tendency to turn into an angry person if i dont have food every two hours it was clear that we needed to find something to eat before someone got hurt north end pizza had been on our radar for a while so we decided it was finally time to stop by after craving 56 slices of their cheesy and saucy goodness following our tiring day,3
i made a sandwich order more than one hour and ten minutes back at this sandwich shop specifically requesting it to be delivered but when i called them recently to inquire about the prolonged wait they casually mentioned that my address is not covered in their delivery area surprisingly even after giving them my phone number and hotel information they didnt bother to inform me about this inconvenience since im currently away on a business trip without any means of transportation i relied on their delivery service now that it has crossed midnight i detest having a meal this late and need to figure out an alternative way to get some food although writing negative yelp reviews isnt my usual practice their service turned out to be equally disappointing as their 420 allusions,0
ive always passed by this place at mgm countless times never knowing how many exactly however the curiosity to try it has always lingered within me finally i decided to give it a shot and surprisingly it turned out better than expected initially i presumed it to be just another ordinary sandwich shop but they surprised me with a diverse selection of sandwiches that were truly tasty among them i found the meatloaf sandwich to be particularly satisfying and even the chicken pesto panini wasnt too shabby a remarkable feature is their availability of breakfast sandwiches throughout the day making it an added bonus for breakfast enthusiasts like myself on the downside the prices are rather steep compared to other sandwich eateries considering the portions served additionally the dining area is quite petite and cramped therefore if it gets crowded it can hinder ones dining comfort,2
i dont know how many times ive been through mgm and passed by this place  ive always wanted to try it and i finally did  it was better than i thoughtnni figured it to be your regular sandwich shop  however they offered a dazzling variety of sandwiches that were pretty tasty  i was pretty happy w the meatloaf sand which and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad eithernnthey serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is an added bonus for all of us that love breakfast foodnni will say that the prices are pretty high compared to other sand which places especially for what youre getting  the dining area is also pretty small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt build for a comfy dining experience,2
ive lost track of the numerous occasions where ive walked past this place in mgm uncountable times yet my desire to give it a try has remained consistently strong finally i seized the opportunity to satisfy my curiosity and surprisingly it exceeded my expectations at first glance i considered it to be a runofthemill sandwich shop but they proved me wrong by offering a dazzling array of sandwiches that were remarkably appetizing personally i found the meatloaf sandwich to be truly satisfying and the chicken pesto panini was also quite decent additionally their allday availability of breakfast sandwiches is a delightful perk for those who adore breakfast food however the prices are rather high in comparison to other sandwich establishments particularly considering what you actually receive furthermore the dining area is on the smaller side and tends to feel cramped so if it gets crowded it does not lend itself to a comfortable dining experience,2
amidst the heat and weariness of a saturday afternoon the expertly handcrafted iced mocha delighted my senses immensely with every sip i held onto the faint hope that my cup would mysteriously replenish itself thoroughly enjoying the refreshing remnants the shops cool and utilitarian vibe along with the talented baristas greatly appealed to me i just wish there were more branches to revel in this atmosphere,3
an added perk is that your meal includes a complimentary 4x6 photo souvenir—cheesy but so perfectly vegas i loved it and consider it a cherished memory of that weekend lastly lets not forget the colored sugar—nothing groundbreaking but it exemplifies the carefree and funloving spirit of las vegas,3
the place holds a special place in my heart as the food it serves is exquisite and the service provided by the staff is exceptional ive had the pleasure of enjoying both breakfast and lunch here on multiple occasions and each visit has consistently delivered a delightful experience what strikes me the most is the unparalleled kindness and willingness to assist from every employee including the owner himself who took time out today to ensure everything was perfect with its welcoming atmosphere and delectable menu its no wonder why i absolutely adore frequenting this place,4
throughout my numerous visits to mgm ive always been intrigued by this particular place yet never got around to trying it until recently to my pleasant surprise it turned out to exceed my initial expectations instead of being just an average sandwich shop they offered an exceptional array of sandwiches that were surprisingly tasty notably the meatloaf sandwich and chicken pesto panini left me satisfied additionally for those who enjoy breakfast food they serve breakfast sandwiches throughout the day which is definitely a plus however i must mention that the prices seem relatively steep compared to similar sandwich joints particularly given the limited and congested dining space available thus if the place gets crowded dont expect a particularly cozy dining experience,2
giving this place a perfect 5star rating upfront might make me skeptical considering its recent opening but i cannot resist  i may have discovered my new favorite haunt the bartender who could also be one of the owners alongside another presumed owner showed incredible attentiveness and genuine niceness the lack of kindness i experience from most people makes encounters like this truly valuable sure you might think their overthetop attentiveness is due to the early days but im hopeful it will continue although the establishment is still in its early stages its potential shines through immediately upon entering youll find an adorable decor reminiscent of ikea featuring comfortable couch seating and tall bar tables the relaxed lighting exudes a pleasantly chilled atmosphere guess what they have a complete selection at the bar whats more they even sought our opinion on the music playing and any recommendations we had  truly impressive the drinks were poured to perfection strong enough to satisfy anyones thirst additionally they mentioned plans to team up with pei wei for appetizers in the near future there were only a few other patrons present during my visit mainly from the older wine bar crowd so lets unite and attract some trendy youthful individuals to transform this place into the buzzing downtown drinking spot it was destined to become,4
around one hour and 10 minutes back i made an order for a sandwich to be delivered from a sandwich shop nearby curiosity led me to call them just now and inquire why the delivery is taking so long surprisingly they informed me that they checked my address and discovered it lies beyond their delivery range its quite baffling since im only 3 miles away whats worse i shared my contact number and hotel information with them assuming they would use it to notify me about any issues being on a business trip without access to a vehicle relying on delivery seemed like the best option sadly its already past midnight and consuming meals this late isnt something i enjoy now i need to explore other alternatives to satisfy my hunger i rarely feel compelled to write negative feedback on yelp but considering the subpar service and their unimaginative usage of marijuana references this experience genuinely calls for it,0
where can a young woman conveniently purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to have a pregame session in our suite before going clubbing so we planned to buy a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to travel long distances so we stumbled upon a store downstairs in our hotel naturally their prices were inflated due to its location on the strip and the hotels upscale nature most places selling alcohol on the strip charge higher than the usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for grey goose as the next best option the bottle of goose cost nearly 85 while you could find it for around 40 at a regular grocery store additionally six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips added up to almost 30 nevertheless the important thing was having a good time which made the convenience of having this place right downstairs all the more appreciated ordering a bottle through room service would set you back a whopping 150,2
walking out my wife and i shared two words signifying our joint determination to never set foot in that place again we doled out 14 dollars for an average sundae all the while knowing that max brenner is just a stones throw away despite the negative reputation others were insistent on experiencing it as tourists despite my preference to spend the same amount on three distinct pints of ben and jerrys ice cream from the nearby market,1
although it might be premature to award this place a full 5star rating since it just opened its doors 2 days ago i am unable to resist  i believe ive stumbled upon the ultimate new hangout the bartender potentially one of the owners along with the other owner who joined them displayed exceptional attentiveness and genuine warmth these acts of kindness are sorely missed in an era where most people lean towards rudeness you may argue that their excessive attentiveness is merely a product of the early phase but i remain hopeful that it will continue despite being in its infancy the place radiates incredible potential as soon as you climb the stairs youll be greeted by a charming decor resembling ikea boasting comfortable couch seating and tall bar tables the subdued lighting sets a delightfully laidback ambiance and wait for it they offer an extensive range of beverages they even value our input on the music selection and welcome any recommendations we have  now thats remarkable moreover the drinks were expertly prepared with potent flavors that wont disappoint on top of all this they hinted at a collaboration with pei wei to serve appetizers in the following weeks during my visit there were only a handful of patrons present mainly from the older wine bar demographic lets rally together and attract some stylish younger individuals to turn this place into the thriving downtown drinking haven it was destined to be,4
ohmygod amazing i walked in there super nervous as ive been told by many other places that they cant treat preop transgendered women bummer but then i found this place and no matter how many times i asked her if she was okay with it the response was always of course yea the experience itself was so nice and welcoming the place was super clean and a really nice shade of purple the bed you lay on was a nice cushioned doctors room bed nngloves were worn and everything was super professional nnthe pain ow but not that bad just like a bunch of rubberbands snapping against you im a flincher so everytime it came on it scared me a bit but it was over pretty quickly nnthe quality of the work amazing i was worried that the little black specks meant that it didnt work properly but i washed my face and applied some sunscreen and could immediately see that there was a less noticeable shadow nnin conclusion nnivy laser salon is awesome nivy laser salon is lgbt friendly nivy laser salon is cleannivy laser salon doesnt hurtnivy laser salon is awesome,4
i had always been intrigued by the name of this place whenever i drove past it however one rainy evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady who i suspected was standing me up i decided to finally step inside and experience the exotic and modern atmosphere that the name and sign promised unfortunately i was disappointed as soon as i entered and saw the unimpressive decor despite that i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar surprisingly there was no sign of the chef or any other customers eventually an american woman emerged from the back and with an indistinguishable npr accent asked me which menus i preferred we engaged in pleasant conversation while being served several drinks unfortunately the water tasted strange resembling mop water used to clean a gym floor the tea was stale and pitifully leaked its flavor into the mop water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger but even the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable amidst the drinks i also ordered various courses of food which were presented apologetically as if the unseen and unheard chef was struggling with some sort of vortex in the spacetime continuum the entree came first followed by sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were withered the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was warmer and salted it seemed like someone had already taken all the interesting delicious and edible food before i arrived my waitress apologized for the order mixup appearing remorseful but not surprised the only redeeming aspect of that evening was the fire island roll which added some color flavor and spice to save the night from turning into a bleak raymond chandler novel after receiving my phone call and settling the bill i left the place feeling strangely sober and still hungry my thoughts were filled with unfulfilled promises and its possible that my recollection of the experience may have been influenced by time passing and too many detective movies,1
the mgm provided us with a satisfactory stay as it stood out for its immense size and captivating appearance illuminated by a mesmerizing green glow at night undoubtedly the majestic lion positioned upfront made it instantly recognizable entering the lobby was a grand experience with its vastness and opulent design moreover the friendly staff promptly checked us into our suite within a few hours after the diligent housekeeping had completed their tasks while the basic room was acceptable it wasnt particularly extraordinary fortunately my travel companion discovered a surprise bottle in his bed that led to an upgrade to one of the more spacious suites let me emphasize that staying in that room felt like living in luxury due to its immense size and regular attentive visits from the staff,2
after considering their breakfast i feel inclined to award them a fivestar rating nevertheless it is necessary for them to update their air conditioning system as the rooms gave off the impression of having a swamp cooler rather than a conventional ac unit this resulted in an uncomfortably hot and humid environment which was a departure from my previous experiences at different embassy suites additionally i would have appreciated a greater availability of towels at the pool area although i must acknowledge that someone did bring additional towels after waiting for a long time fortunately the quality of their breakfast was excellent and played a significant role in raising my rating to three stars,2
living within close vicinity of el gordito super market doesnt encourage frequent visits mainly because flies have become a rampant issue there the inadequately covered hot and ready food tends to dehydrate yet the establishment continues serving them without addressing this concern or the presence of flies this becomes evident when buying a torta which turned out to contain rotten meat and taste disgustingly bad furthermore gazing upon the bread inside the glass display reveals the unsightly sight of flies hovering around rendering it extremely unappealing,0
the proximity of el gordito super market to my residence doesnt entice me to visit regularly due to the prevalent fly problem the open presentation of their hot and ready meals leads to the food drying out while the lack of hygiene persists as they still serve them alongside the lingering flies this unpleasantness was intensified when i bought a torta and discovered that the meat was spoiled resulting in a repulsive taste additionally even the glass display where the bread is exhibited holds an offputting view of these uninvited flies,0
this pub is incredible i visited with a few pals had a great time sipping drinks and playing games the lounge is mindblowing featuring an impressive display of tvs where you can watch anything you want the prices for drinks and food are reasonable and the bar always has a fresh crowd of people its perfect for locals who want to create new memories,2
let me preface my review by sharing a few key facts firstly during this particular dining experience i was accompanied by my boyfriend and his family who are of chinese descent they graciously took charge of ordering dishes that reflected the true essence of authentic chinese cuisine while at the restaurant i made an effort to maintain a cheerful demeanor and indulged in copious amounts of rice to satiate my hunger,0
so after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a  hankering for seafood  haha well actually my bf made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt quite so sudden so we had reservations for 715pm but we were a bit early and usually restaurants allow for early incomers to be seated but since they were quite busy we actually had to wait till 715pmwhich is fine nnthe place looked like your usual seafood and grill restaurantnot much uniqueness in its arrangement or settingdimly lit with bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left didnt really have much of a seafoodoceany feel to it but eh i guess i didnt expect it to be like joes crab shack or something afterall  this is a fancier place nni thought the service from the hosts and our waitress was very friendly and great but on the other hand the manager wasnt how i expect them to be so there was this older caucasian couple that was also waiting to be seatedand we were standing close to themthe manager walks by smiles and welcomes them and tells them theyll be seated sooni was thinking that we would get the same nice friendly greet and welcome from him but he didnt even smile or say hi i felt offended because we were customers tooand shouldnt you greet your customers all the same way not only that but he walked passed us several times before we were seated without a greet or smilei just felt very insulted my bf and i look quite young and we are asianim not saying hes races but i did feel he was prejudice nnwell anyways on to the foodthe food was decent nothing to really rave aboutthe half order of louisiana oysters were pretty good my louisiana red fish filet sauteed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was made very welli specially like the crab and the lemon chive butter sauce went very well with the fish on the other hand my bfs broiled swordfish had a very strong oceany saltfishy  tastewhich some might not be fond ofand it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which was better tasting then the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also somewhat of a disappointment since it too lack taste nnoverall i didnt really have a super spectacular dining experience at this restaurant hopefully the other locations of wildfish seafood grille are much better the bill came out to be around 80seafood is expensive but i was also paying for quality of service food and atmosphere of which i didnt feel like i got my bfs moneys worth,2
the mac n cheese here is amazing the service i receive is always exceptional and the happy hour specials are fantastic,3
all things considered i would unequivocally never return to this establishment and wholeheartedly caution individuals with sensitive stomachs or heightened olfactory senses to steer clear of this place at all costs i wish to emphasize that these insights merely reflect my individual preferences and opinions as what i truly desire is to savor the flavors of my food rather than being overwhelmed by excessive seasoning or gravies and need i even mention the overpowering smell a resounding check please,0
proximity to el gordito supermarket doesnt guarantee regular visits from me primarily because the store suffers from a persistent fly problem the lack of attention becomes evident in their handling of the hot and ready food section which frequently remains exposed and dries out as a result shockingly this subpar quality doesnt deter them from serving the dehydrated dishes disgustingly enough i once bought a torta only to discover that the meat inside was rotten and tasted extremely unpleasant to make matters worse even the glass display housing the bread attracts flies creating an unappetizing scene,0
soon enough the food began arriving at our table our order included a generous pot of oolong tea accompanying our meal however we were duly informed that the tea along with the glasses of water on our table had originated from the tap on the bright side the steamed white rice proved to be acceptable and i consumed a substantial portion of it unfortunately the dungeness crab arrived served in pieces within its shell smothered in an unappetizing brown gravy that completely masked its delicious taste similarly the lobster dish was presented chopped up and drowned in sauce making it inconvenient to handle without getting hands dirty even when serving oneself from the lazy susan adding to the array of culinary challenges the cod dish arrived with an assortment of bones intact showcasing its eyes and head in full view having encountered prior unfortunate incidents involving fish bones i exercised caution and refrained from tasting it the rest of the table however fearlessly devoured every part including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks causing a shudder to run through me while simply a matter of personal preference i must admit that this was not to my liking,0
before sharing my review let me mention a few important details firstly my boyfriend and his family who are of chinese descent joined me for the meal secondly they took charge of ordering dishes in order to ensure an authentic chinese experience finally despite my discomfort i ate plenty of rice with a smile on my face,0
im not completely sure how five guys manages to meet the outdated serving regulations of north carolina by offering juicy burgers that are not medium rare it could be due to their specific meat grinding process that includes just the right amount of fat or perhaps it is the way they cook the burgers to order on a flattop regardless of the method they succeed in delivering a satisfying meal with an abundance of condiments to choose from the fries at this place are exceptional as well  freshly cut and fried to near perfection available plain or seasoned with cajun spices you can tell they take their fries seriously when they provide the days potato location and offer malt vinegar for extra flavor furthermore the staff at this location deserves praise for their ability to consistently serve burgers and fries even during busy periods all while maintaining a friendly demeanor overall they excel in providing a quality dining experience,4
after an intense workout this location is the ideal spot to indulge in a scrumptious sandwich the service at this place is speedy as well ensuring that you wont have to endure any waiting time like you would at a subway furthermore the ingredients used here are of superior quality compared to other options i highly recommend trying the vito and the beach club personally ive never encountered any issues with the employees who consistently greet me warmly during my visits rest assured ill definitely be returning for more delightful subs,4
the name of this place had intrigued me every time i drove by until one drizzling dismal evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady i suspected was standing me up i stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic lusty and modern experience the name and sign promisednnimmediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor i draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence a young woman american came from the back and in an unplaceable npr accent asked me which menus id like clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before mennthe water tasted  odd  smelling of a mopbucket after cleaning a gym floor tea next in the saddest stalest teabag i have ever seen pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water okay something bottled and stronger alas the sake was lukewarm and unremarkablennsomewhere amidst the drinks buffet id ordered several courses of food which came out apologetically ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the spacetime continuum  entree immediately then sushi soup then finally a wilted miserable salad the rice was dry the chicken bland the vegetables wilted the soup was the mopwater but warmer and salted presumably someone had come in advance of me ordered the entire restaurants supply of interesting delicious and tolerable then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophiesnnmy waitress apologized about the order looking contrite but not surprisednnthe shining light of that eveningapart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust faded posters and ancient panelingwas the fire island roll  this single element of color flavor and spice rescued the night from the raymond chandler direction it was takingnni got my phone call paid my tab and left frighteningly sober and still hungry my head and stomach full of naught but unfulfilled promisesnned its entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time and too many detective movies,1
the mac and cheese at this restaurant is something i love and the service i get there is consistently exceptional the happy hour they offer is truly amazing,3
i accompanied some colleagues to this establishment and unfortunately i found it underwhelming the sandwiches they offer here are overpriced and do not surpass the quality of another popular eatery to clarify i am not particularly fond of the said eatery either but if youre in search of a decent sandwich that would be your best bet although i initially considered giving this place a rating of 3 the steep pricing brought it down to a 2,1
i walked into that place with immense nervousness thanks to the countless rejections i had faced as a preop transgender woman seeking treatment at other establishments but then i stumbled upon this hidden gem named ivy laser salon where my concerns were truly met with understanding and acceptance without fail whenever i inquired about their willingness to work with me their response was always positive the overall experience presented a remarkable sense of niceness and hospitality residing within an impeccably clean space adorned with a delightful shade of purple the examination bed reminiscent of ones found in doctors rooms provided a comfortable platform for the procedure while the staff diligently adhered to safety measures by wearing gloves and maintaining a professional attitude throughout as for the anticipated pain it wasnt nearly as severe as i dreaded more akin to the sensation of rubberbands snapping against my skin even for someone like me prone to flinching the discomfort quickly subsided most importantly the quality of the work performed surpassed my expectations despite initial concerns over small black specks subsequent washing of my face and applying sunscreen immediately unveiled a less conspicuous shadow in conclusion ivy laser salon proves itself to be worthy of admiration an establishment that is truly awesome in every aspect inclusive and welcoming to the lgbtq community impeccably clean devoid of significant pain and delivering amazing results,4
what are the potential places in close proximity where a girl can conveniently purchase alcohol my friends and i intended to have a pregame session inside our suite before hitting the clubs consequently we wanted to acquire a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to undertake a lengthy walk so we luckily stumbled upon a store conveniently located on the lower floor of our hotel as expected the prices there were inflated due to its prime strip location and association with a highend hotel it is worth noting that most venues selling alcohol on the strip tend to sell it at a price higher than its usual retail value unfortunately they did not have any belvedere in stock so we settled for grey goose as a suitable alternative shockingly enough the bottle of grey goose put us back almost 85 quite steep when you consider that it usually retails for around 40 at your standard grocery market additionally we purchased six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips which added up to nearly 30 nonetheless we embraced the fact that our priority was to enjoy ourselves making us very grateful that this particular store was within such close range if we had opted instead to order a bottle through room service it would have emptied our pockets by a whopping 150,2
staying at the mgm grand was overall pleasant due to its impressive size and the stunning nighttime illumination the majestic lion sculpture in front of the hotel made it easily recognizable inside the immense and luxurious lobby welcomed us and the counter staff were exceedingly amicable promptly securing our suite reservation after housekeeping attended to it although the standard room was acceptable my companions lucky find – a bottle in his bed – prompted an upgrade to a more spacious suite let me assure you this experience felt like living in abundance with frequent visits from the attentive staff ensuring our comfort nonetheless the quality of food ordered through room service left much to be desired and the lack of a kitchenette limited culinary options to unsatisfying pizza and chilly breakfast,2
the employees at this establishment are polite and pleasant but lack any distinct personalities resembling more like lifeless individuals going about their tasks like zombies i ordered coconut chicken soup which should have actually been renamed mushroom soup since mushrooms dominated the dish the soup itself was tasteless enough to discourage me from drinking it only trying to salvage some bits of chicken from within on the other hand my companion ordered mint pork his usual thai choice and found the spiciness level perfect and the flavor outstanding if we were to return it would be solely for his preference and to order takeout my daughter opted for beef broccoli enjoying the meat and vegetables but felt that the sauce contained an excessive amount of clam juice giving the impression of a seafood dish the customer base seems to attract more boisterous individuals so expect to hear loud complaints however i must admit the employees handled these situations with composure albeit in an automatonic manner somewhat resembling zombies it wouldnt be advisable to visit this place unless youre feeling adventurous and willing to take a risk,1
these individuals seem to find it too bothersome to shred imitation crab as they have now resorted to using a food processor to grind it into an unappealing mealy mush unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh i brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on allyoucaneat but there was nothing appetizing for me after tasting the first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself however her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she doesnt eat a lot being only 7 years old my beloved volcano roll which used to be outstanding turned out to be a disgusting gritty mush with rice and eel sauce haphazardly thrown on top the moment i tasted it i literally spat it out in disgust i left this repulsive mess on the plate and silently dared them to question me about it trying to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll which used to be flavorful with shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo to my dismay it also contained the abominable crabgrit mush fed up with the crab debacle i changed my strategy and started ordering nigiri the yellowtail was barely recognizable and lacked any resemblance to its usual appearance when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i also gave the cajun albacore a try managing to enjoy it slightly since the ponzu sauce masked the unpleasant taste of the notsofresh fish in hindsight i should have walked out when i first entered the restaurant and was greeted by a strong fishy odor to make matters worse when my daughter and i attempted to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for disgusting sushi and i can only have one lousy mochi i refuse to ever set foot in this establishment again just the mere thought of that night makes me feel nauseous,0
revised phrases,3
for an entire year ive faithfully supported pho nam a charming smallscale vietnamese restaurant managed by a tightknit family now at long last im seizing the opportunity to compose a review about their phenomenal vietnamese fare and exceptional customer care without fail we find ourselves gravitating towards this establishment for sunday lunches especially during the winter months when hearty bowls of pho with perfectly cooked rare beef and a serving of mouthwatering vermicelli topped with savory pork become our goto orders,3
we had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadnt eaten all day im the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or i grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off needless to say i needed to eat before someone got hurt nnwe had been wanting to try north end pizza for awhile so when i felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop nnno debating for me over what to order margherita special for the day yes in a large please and a side of fries nnthe fries werent great werent bad i dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved they brought out the pizza and i was a little disappointed it was a bit skimpy on the cheese nnafter my first slice i was hooked the crust is thin but not super thin the sauce has a lot of flavor and the mozzarella what there was of it was fresh my husband and i ate the entire large pizza right then and there,3
two words my wife and i said to each other as we were walking outnnnever againnn14 for a sundae that was just ok while max brenner is just a walk away  i knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews  id rather buy 3 different pints of ben and jerrys from the supermarket,1
i have a strong fondness for the mac and cheese served at this particular spot and the highquality service i receive never fails to impress me the happy hour specials are absolutely outstanding,3
i ordered a sandwhich an hour and 10 minutes ago from this sandwhich shop for delivery and i just called to see whats taking so long and they were like oh yeah we looked up the address and its outside of our delivery area sorry man i am only 3 miles away i even gave them my phone number and hotel info and they didnt contact me to let me know what is up nnim away on business with no car so im relying on delivery its past midnight now hate eating this late and i have to try and find a way and get food i dont usually write angry yelp reviews but the service was as bad as their 420 innuendos,0
the fries were average but nothing terrible a sprinkle of garlic salt instantly elevated their taste however when they brought out the pizza i couldnt help but feel slightly disappointed with the lack of cheese topping but after taking my first slice i was completely hooked the crust struck a perfect balance between being thin yet not too thin while the sauce was bursting with flavor although there wasnt much mozzarella it was undoubtedly fresh my husband and i devoured the entire large pizza right then and there,3
as a devoted customer over the past year i recently set aside some time to express my admiration for pho nam an intimate vietnamese dining spot that prides itself on being a beloved familyrun endeavor the culinary delights served here are consistently outstanding matched only by the attentive service provided by the staff during the winter season our tradition of enjoying sunday lunch at this establishment remains strong with our preferred dishes consistently being the fragrant pho brimming with tender rare beef and the luscious vermicelli adorned with savory pork,3
soon after our food arrived at the table we ordered a large pot of oolong tea which came with a warning — along with the glasses of water on our table — that it was tap water the steamed white rice was satisfactory and i managed to consume most of it however the dungeness crab served chopped up but still in its shell and drowning in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce failed to preserve its delectable taste similarly the lobster was disassembled and covered in sauce making it messy to eat even when served by oneself from the lazy susan additionally the cod dish was presented with all its bones intact including the fully preserved head eyes and eyeballs due to past unpleasant experiences with fish bones i decided not to taste it although the rest of the table devoured the entire dish including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks i personally find this repulsive overall i have absolutely no intention of returning to the restaurant and caution those with sensitive stomachs or a strong sense of smell to avoid it at all costs of course this is merely my own personal preference and opinion – but i appreciate being able to savor the true flavors of food instead of relying solely on heavily seasoned gravy and as for the odor… oh my goodness could you please bring us the check,0
could you suggest a nearby location where an individual particularly a female can easily acquire alcoholic beverages me and my companions had the intention of having some drinks in our suite before heading out to a nightclub so we decided to purchase a bottle of belvedere however we wanted to avoid excessive walking distance so we discovered a shop conveniently situated on the lower floor of our hotel understandably the costs here are inflated due to its location in a prominent strip area and within a deluxe hotel most establishments selling alcohol in this vicinity tend to charge higher than the standard retail price regrettably they did not have any belvedere available consequently we settled for the alternative choice of grey goose this bottle came with a hefty price tag of nearly 85 whereas you could typically obtain it for around 40 at a regular supermarket moreover six small bottles of cranberry juice and a bag of chips amounted to nearly 30 nonetheless we were content as the primary focus was on enjoying ourselves we expressed immense gratitude for the convenience of having this shop accessible just steps away from our suite considering that ordering a bottle through room service would have cost an astounding 150,2
johnny rockets has always been a beloved favorite of mine but i must express my disappointment with this particular establishment the unfriendly demeanor and lack of attentiveness exhibited by the female staff were quite offputting if you want to make sure you actually receive what you intended to order it is wise to have the staff repeat your order back to you on a personal note despite ordering a mouthwatering tuna melt what i ended up with was nothing more than a cold tuna sandwich which i had no choice but to throw away the entire experience felt like a total waste of 10 leading me to decide against returning here the next time im at the mall,1
hey totally the real deal my friend,4
im hesitant to bust out 5 stars for this place because theyve only been open for 2 days but i cant help myself i think i may have found a new haunt nthe bartender possibly part owner and what i can only assume was the other owner were extremely attentive and nice just plain nice i miss nice alot most people are assholes ya ya youre probably thinking well it is day two of course theyre going to be overly attentive and that may be so i just hope it sticks nnthings were still in a very preliminary stage in a lot of ways but you can see the potential when you walk up the stairs super cute ikeaish decor couch like seating area as well as high bar tables low very chill lighting full bar thats right people full bar they even asked us our opinion on the music and if we had any recommendations awesome  the pour was good and strong and im told they are going to be married so to speak with pei wei to offer appetizers in the next couple weeks nnthere were only a couple of other people there at the time slightly older wine bar crowd nso lets band together get some sessy younger  mother fkrs together and turn this place into what its meant to be a badass downtown drink spot,4
there was no doubt or hesitation when it came to what i wanted to order from north end pizza without any second thoughts i went straight for the margherita special of the day in a large size accompanied by a side of fries ,3
after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a craving for seafood however my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt as spontaneous as it seemed we had reservations for 715 pm but arrived early usually restaurants allow early arrivals to be seated but because they were busy we had to wait until exactly 715 pm the restaurant had a typical seafood and grill setup with dim lighting a bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it didnt have much of a seainspired atmosphere but considering it was a fancier place i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or anything ,2
in advance i made a call to terminex to set up an appointment well ahead of time through multiple text messages i confirmed the appointment time of 1 pm on a saturday with dave s disappointingly dave failed to show up and ignored my repeated calls and texts for approximately 6 hours eventually joe contacted me as the representative for my area asking if i wanted to arrange another appointment despite being unsatisfied with the companys service i reluctantly agreed when joe arrived for the said appointment he proposed an exorbitantly high bid that surpassed the rates of other companies by over threefold even though the required work was relatively minimal and the warranty offered was much shorter it is important to note that there exist numerous other contractors in the termite control industry who provide more reasonable pricing options as this particular company appears to run a fraudulent business,0
before diving into any decent meal especially one shared with my chinese inlaws visiting from china it is customary for me to commence with thorough handwashing as luck would have it upon entering the bathroom at diamonds i was unpleasantly surprised by its offputting odor considering i work as a mortician and encounter putrid smells daily the fact that the bathroom stench managed to turn my stomach says a lot nevertheless feeling obligated to stay and complete our meal i swiftly exited the bathroom and resorted to using antibacterial hand sanitizer instead,0
overall i didnt have an exceptional dining experience at this restaurant hopefully other locations of wildfish seafood grille offer a better overall experience the bill amounted to approximately 80 considering seafoods expensive nature i expected to pay for quality service food and atmosphere none of which i felt i received my boyfriends moneys worth,2
i hold a strong affection towards johnny rockets but sadly this specific outlet left much to be desired the lack of friendliness and attention from the employees particularly the female staff members was rather disheartening to guarantee receiving what you desire its recommended to insist on having your order repeated in my own personal encounter i ordered a tuna melt only to receive a chilled tuna sandwich which compelled me to discard it the whole ordeal felt like a complete waste of 10 hence i will skip visiting this place during my next trip to the mall,1
planning ahead i reached out to terminex and scheduled an appointment with them two weeks ago to confirm the appointment time of 1 pm on a saturday i exchanged several text messages with dave s however dave never showed up and completely disregarded my multiple attempts to get in touch with him for approximately 6 hours eventually joe phoned me and introduced himself as the representative covering my area he asked if i wanted to book another appointment despite my dissatisfaction with the companys conduct i reluctantly agreed when joe finally arrived for the scheduled appointment he presented a bid that was outrageously high more than triple the amount quoted by other companies for similar tasks and offering a much shorter warranty it is worth noting that there are numerous other termite control contractors available who offer more reasonable pricing as this particular company appears to be involved in dishonest business practices,0
i am inclined to give them a fivestar rating primarily due to the quality of their breakfast however i do think that they should improve their air conditioning system as the rooms felt more like using a swamp cooler instead of a regular ac unit it was quite hot and humid inside the rooms because of this this experience was unusual for me as i have stayed at various embassy suites before another minor issue was the limited availability of towels at the pool but fortunately someone eventually brought some more towels the saving grace was their breakfast which bumped up my rating to three stars,2
i called and set up an appointment with terminex two weeks in advance i exchanged multiple texts with dave s confirming my appointment time for 1 pm on a saturday the next day i waited and he never showed up he never responded to my multiple calls and texts about 6 hours later i got a call from joe who said that he was the rep for my area and would i like to schedule an appointment although i was very unhappy with the company i agreed when he came for the appointment he gave me a bid that was absolutely unbelievably high more than three times higher than the other companies i subsequently contacted for far less work and a much shorter warranty there are many other contractors for termite control that are reasonable  but this company is just a racket,0
my visit to this bar was absolutely superb together with a few companions we reveled in the ambience relishing luscious libations and engaging in entertaining games the lounge section left me speechless featuring an astonishing array of television screens that cater to your every whim not only were the prices for food and beverages fair but the constant influx of new individuals ensures a vibrant atmosphere making it a goto spot for locals looking to create precious moments,2

the iced mocha prepared for me during a sweltering and exhausting saturday afternoon was exceptionally impressive in the end i couldnt resist continuously sipping on the diluted icy residue desperately hoping my cup would magically replenish itself i adore the cool and functional ambiance of the coffee shop as well as the expertise displayed by the baristas its just unfortunate that there arent more outlets to relish,3
having been a loyal patron for the past year i have finally taken the time to share my thoughts on pho nam a cozy vietnamese eatery run by a closeknit family throughout our visits they consistently served delectable vietnamese cuisine accompanied by impeccable service as the winter season approaches we frequently choose this restaurant for our sunday lunches typically indulging in their flavorful pho with tender rare beef and tasty vermicelli with succulent pork,3
i placed an order for a sandwich over an hour and 10 minutes ago from this particular sandwich shop intending it to be delivered however upon calling them to inquire about the delay i was informed that my address falls outside their delivery zone its disappointing because im merely 3 miles away from their location and i even provided them with my phone number and hotel details expecting some form of communication unfortunately im on a business trip without a car so i heavily relied on delivery its now past midnight and i dislike eating at such late hours now i have to find an alternative means to satiate my hunger this experience has left me slightly frustrated enough to consider leaving an unfavorable review on yelp  both due to the poor service and their clichéd attempts at humor,0
accompanying my colleagues i explored this venue only to find myself unimpressed by their costly selection of sandwiches which failed to outshine jasons deli to be clear i am not an ardent supporter of jasons deli either but if you are seeking a reasonably satisfactory sandwich i recommend visiting them initially i planned to give this place a rating of 3 out of 5 but due to its steep prices i had no choice but to deduct a point leaving it with a score of 2,1
ill give them five stars based on breakfast the rooms itself they need to update their airconditioning system  the rooms feel more like a swamp cooler than a regular ac unit not to mention hot humid the rooms feel because its like a swamp cooler ive stayed at different embassy suites and never felt this before wouldve been nice if they had more towels available at the pool but after a long wait someone came along and brought some more towels thank goodness for the breakfast thats a bumped up  my rating to the three stars,2
in advance i phoned terminex and confirmed a meeting two weeks prior there were several text message conversations exchanged with dave s to verify that my appointment would occur at 1 pm on a saturday shockingly he failed to appear and disregarded all my calls and texts attempting to reach him about six hours later i received a call from joe who introduced himself as the local representative suggesting we arrange another appointment even though i was highly dissatisfied with the company i begrudgingly agreed surprisingly joe quoted an outrageously high bid during the subsequent appointment surpassing the prices of other companies i approached for less extensive work and with shorter warranty periods it is worth noting that there exist many reasonably priced contractors specializing in termite control however this particular company appears to operate in a dishonest manner,0
i have a great fondness for johnny rockets but unfortunately i found this particular branch to be quite disappointing the staff members especially the girls working there lacked friendliness and attentiveness it is advisable to ask them to repeat your order to ensure accuracy personally i had a regrettable experience where i ordered a tuna melt but received a cold tuna sandwich instead this incident was such a waste of 10 that i have decided to avoid this location when dining at the mall in the future,1
i have a deep affection for the mac n cheese they serve at this establishment the level of service is consistently topnotch and their happy hour promotions are truly remarkable,3
several weeks beforehand i contacted terminex and successfully secured an appointment to ensure everything was in order i engaged in multiple text message exchanges with dave s to confirm that the meeting would take place at 1 pm on a saturday regrettably he never arrived and my numerous attempts to reach him through calls and texts went unanswered after approximately six hours joe contacted me claiming to be the representative assigned to my area questioning whether i would like to reschedule despite harboring dissatisfaction toward the company i reluctantly accepted during the subsequent appointment joe presented me with a bid that was shockingly exorbitant surpassing the prices quoted by other companies i later approached for significantly less labor and offering shorter warranties it is important to note that there exists a multitude of termite control contractors who offer more reasonable rates while this specific company appears to operate as nothing more than a fraudulent scheme,0
good pawn shop a lot of items at high prices of course general manager paul was rude most likely wont be returning simply for the lack of respect,1
when i walked into that place i was really nervous because many other places had turned me away as a preop transgender woman but then i found this gem of a place where no matter how many times i checked if they were cool with it they assured me that yes they were the whole experience was incredibly nice and welcoming with a super clean environment and a visually pleasing shade of purple the examination bed i laid on was nicely cushioned just like a typical doctors room bed and the staff took all necessary precautions by wearing gloves and maintaining a high level of professionalism the pain well it wasnt as bad as i feared more like the sensation of a bunch of rubberbands being snapped against my skin as a flincher it did startle me every time but luckily it didnt last long and most importantly the quality of the work performed was simply amazing despite worrying about some little black specks a quick wash of my face and application of sunscreen immediately revealed a less noticeable shadow in conclusion ivy laser salon truly lives up to its reputation awesome lgbtq friendly clean painless and outstanding results,4
the atmosphere of this restaurant embodies both the good and tacky aspects of las vegas it feels like a local version of cheers meets a flashy disco ball with a cozy and friendly vibe the interior design is reminiscent of stepping into a neonlined disco ball adorned with disco glass on pillars and ceilings giant tv screens and neon lighting surround everything creating an energetic ambiance there is also a cool lounge area in the back but we chose to dine in the bustling restaurant at the front imagine dennys on a flamboyant gay cruise from the 80s and youll get a sense of what peppermill offers except with extraordinary food and generous portions,3
not sure how five guys does it but they somehow meet archaic nc state law against serving medium rare beef while still serving a juicy burger  perhaps its the grind they use having the right amount of fat or how they cook them to order on the flattop but they pull it off  lots of fixings to choose from and the fries are just delicious  fresh cut and fried to close to perfection with a choice of plain or cajun seasoned  any place that lists the location of todays potatos and also offers malt vinegar to douse them in has to take fries seriouslynnthe staff at this location does a great job of keeping the burgers and fries coming no matter how busy they are and are always friendly  high marks for the total package,4
i have lost count of the number of times i have passed by this place in mgm but i have always been curious to try it out finally i had the chance and to my surprise it exceeded my expectations i initially thought it was just an ordinary sandwich shop but they actually offer a wide range of delicious sandwiches i particularly enjoyed their meatloaf sandwich and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad either another plus point is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is great for breakfast food lovers like me however the prices are quite high compared to other sandwich places especially considering what you get the dining area is also small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt make for a very comfortable dining experience,2
moved in with a friend and what an absurdity  firstly the laundry room adjacent to our unit lacks air conditioning and the machines are consistently out of order on top of that the place is disgustingly unclean i brought up these issues with maintenance who acknowledged them but placed them low on their list of priorities when i asked my roommate who has resided here for four years he claimed the laundry room has never worked properly even with various attempts to fix it additionally we are greeted by piles of dog feces right outside our front door every morning and when we report it to management they refuse to take any action moreover there are no dishwashers or special amenities available all while we are charged exorbitant prices for just a onebedroom unit maintenance is inept at properly repairing anything and the apathetic management only exacerbates the situation to make matters worse the entire office staff was terminated recently  one for embezzling rent money and another for covering it up as a result residents are breaking their leases just to escape this nightmare furthermore since the outofstate management took over they have given all section 8 renters until december to vacate disregarding any previously agreed rental agreements however one silver lining is that with tenants leaving the shared water bill has decreased on our end while the apartment itself is spacious for a onebedroom there is a storage room that could be converted into a washerdryer area and the cabinets in both the kitchen and bathroom desperately need updating a fresh coat of paint wont cut it the bathtub has been painted so many times that stubborn stains remain impossible to remove and unwelcome crickets and bugs find easy access through the illfitting front door,0
we had spent the entire afternoon under the scorching sun without having any meals being someone who cannot function properly without eating every two hours i tend to get extremely agitated over trivial matters if i dont eat on time naturally i needed to have something to eat before things got out of hand we had been meaning to try north end pizza for quite some time so when the craving for 56 slices of delicious and cheesy goodness struck after a tiring day in the sun we finally decided to stop by,3
a wellestablished establishment with a wide selection of items albeit priced on the higher side unfortunately had a discourteous general manager named paul based on the disrespectful treatment received it is unlikely that i will revisit this place,1
after being a regular customer for the last year ive finally gotten around to reviewing  pho nam small family owned restaurant theyve always provided delicious vietnamese food and great service we frequent this restaurant for sunday lunch particularly in the winters and our orders usually consist of pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,3
its impressive how five guys manages to comply with outdated north carolina state regulations on serving medium rare beef while still delivering tasty juicy burgers maybe its their unique meat grinding technique that ensures the ideal fat content or their method of cooking each patty to order on the flat grill whatever the secret they certainly succeed in offering a wide variety of toppings and incredibly delicious fries these freshly cut fries are fried perfectly available plain or seasoned with cajun seasoning the fact that they disclose the location of todays potatoes and provide malt vinegar for dipping shows their commitment to taking their fries seriously moreover the staff at this particular location deserves praise for their ability to keep up with orders even during busy periods all while maintaining a friendly demeanor this establishment truly excels in providing a topnotch dining experience from start to finish,4
these individuals seem to have found a shortcut for shredding imitation crab as they now opt to use a food processor that transforms it into an unappetizing and grainy paste furthermore the fish pieces were not fresh at all despite spending 62 on the allyoucaneat option i couldnt find anything satisfying to eat after taking my first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself unfortunately my daughters roll arrived precut which i had to return since she couldnt consume the whole portion considering her age my oncebeloved volcano roll turned out to be revolting and gritty mush topped with rice and eel sauce the taste was so horrible that i literally spat it out and left the distasteful mess untouched on the plate ordering a mexican roll hoping for a delicious combination of shredded crab shrimp and spicy mayo with avocado only led to disappointment as it contained the same obnoxious crabgrit mush following the crab disaster i decided to switch to ordering nigiri however the yellowtail looked completely different from what yellowtail should look like even when i questioned the sushi chef about it he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i managed to somewhat enjoy the cajun albacore by drowning its notsofresh taste with ponzu sauce but overall the experience was underwhelming from the moment i entered the place and encountered the pungent fish smell i should have turned around and left as if this dinner couldnt get any worse when we tried to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one per person considering the exorbitant price i paid for subpar sushi limiting me to just one mochi is truly ridiculous needless to say i will never set foot in this abysmal excuse of a sushi bar again the mere recollection of that night makes me feel nauseated,0
without a doubt this place will become a regular addition to my rotation of vegas goto spots,3
these guys clearly avoid the effort of shredding imitation crab as they opt for grinding it up in a food processor instead resulting in an unappetizing and gritty mush moreover the quality of the fish pieces was far from fresh despite spending a substantial amount of 62 for the allyoucaneat option i found nothing desirable to eat after tasting the first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughters request and a volcano roll for myself however my daughters roll arrived already cut given her young age and small appetite the once impressive volcano roll which used to be their best offering turned into a repulsive and gritty concoction topped with rice and eel sauce that compelled me to spit it out immediately with disappointment setting in i decided to try a mexican roll—a typically delicious combination of spicy mayo shredded crab shrimp and avocado—only to discover the same distasteful crabgrit mush inside frustrated by this mishap i changed my order to nigiri to my surprise the yellowtail had no resemblance to its usual appearance but when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted it was indeed yellowtail the cajun albacore provided some relief as the ponzu sauce masked the lessthanfresh taste to a certain extent from the moment i entered the establishment and was greeted by the pungent smell of fish i should have taken it as a sign and walked away to top off the disappointing dinner experience my daughter and i were informed that we could only have one mochi each despite paying 62 for the unappetizing sushi spread needless to say i have no intention of ever returning to this subpar sushi bar even the mere thought of that evening is enough to make me feel queasy,0
this location is highly recommended for getting a sandwich post an intense exercise session it also boasts quick service eliminating any need to linger like one would at subway furthermore the ingredients used here are of superior quality compared to other places i suggest trying the vito and the beach club sandwiches personally i have never encountered any issues with the staff as they have always been amiable and greeted me warmly during my visits consequently i will undoubtedly return for more delicious subs,4
living close to el gordito supermarket means having easy access but i find myself going there infrequently due to the presence of flies throughout the premises even worse the hot and ready food on display is often left uncovered causing it to dry out surprisingly despite its condition the staff continues to serve the driedout food one unfortunate experience involved purchasing a torta with spoiled meat which made it taste repulsive adding to the unpleasant sight you can spot flies inside the glass display case where the bread is showcased,0
on a sweltering and fatigueinducing saturday afternoon i treated myself to an exceptionally delightful iced mocha savoring every last drop i longed for my cup to spontaneously replenish itself the shops chilled and functional atmosphere along with the baristas impressive skills captivated me entirely if only there were more locations where i could relish their beverages,3
man no doubt its a great investment buddy,4
after receiving my longawaited phone call settling the bill and leaving the place alarmingly sober and still hungry i couldnt help but feel deceived by unfilled promises its entirely possible that the passage of time and my obsession with detective movies might have influenced my perception of the experience described above,1
whenever i eat with my chinese inlaws while theyre visiting from china i like to begin the meal with a thorough handwashing my visit to diamonds restaurant bathroom was so unpleasant that it nearly made me vomit as someone accustomed to foul odors due to my profession as a mortician being nauseated by a restroom smell says a lot to avoid further misery i opted for using antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the bathroom instead,0
accompanied by my colleagues i visited this establishment and found myself unimpressed by their overpriced sandwiches that failed to surpass the quality of jasons deli although i am not particularly fond of jasons deli if you seek a reasonably satisfying sandwich i suggest going there instead on a scale of 1 to 5 i would have given this place a 3 but its high price brought it down to a 2,1
following our visit to the sea life aquarium in tempe i found myself craving seafood interestingly my boyfriend had made reservations through opentable in advance so the decision to dine there wasnt impulsive although we had booked a table for 715 pm we arrived slightly early normally restaurants allow early birds to be seated but due to their high demand we had to wait until the exact reservation time the restaurant had a runofthemill seafood and grill layout marked by dim lighting a central bar booths on one side and tables on the other the ambiance lacked a strong maritime vibe but considering it was an upscale establishment i didnt anticipate a resemblance to joes crab shack or similar places,2
the service from the hosts and our waitress was friendly and great however i was disappointed by the managers behavior there was an older caucasian couple waiting to be seated next to us and when the manager walked by he smiled greeted them and assured them they would be seated soon i expected him to extend the same warm welcome to us but he didnt even acknowledge us it made me feel offended and showed a lack of equality in greeting customers moreover he passed by us multiple times without a smile or a greeting while i dont want to assume any racial prejudice i couldnt help but feel that way as my boyfriend and i are asian and appear quite young,2
although things are still in the early stages you can already see the potential when you ascend the stairs the decor is cute and reminiscent of ikea with couchlike seating areas and high bar tables the lighting creates a mellow ambiance and yes they have a full bar they even asked for our input on the music and welcomed any recommendations it was awesome the drinks were poured generously and packed a punch they mentioned that they will soon partner with pei wei to offer appetizers within the next few weeks,4
upon visiting tempes sea life aquarium i developed an abrupt desire for seafood coincidentally my boyfriend had preemptively secured reservations via opentable eliminating any element of spontaneity our table reservation was set for 715 pm although we arrived a tad early typically restaurants are accommodating towards early birds yet due to their bustling business we were compelled to wait until the designated time the establishment boasted a typical seafood and grill layout featuring low lighting a central bar booth seating to the right and table seating to the left sadly it lacked a distinct oceanic feel nonetheless given its upscale nature i wasnt anticipating an ambiance similar to that of joes crab shack or comparable venues,2
i entered the place feeling extremely nervous because i had been rejected by other establishments for preoperative transgender women which was disappointing however i discovered this particular place where no matter how many times i asked they assured me that it was absolutely fine the experience itself was incredibly pleasant and welcoming with a super clean environment and an attractive purple color scheme they had a comfortable bed in the examination room wearing gloves and maintaining utmost professionalism while there was some discomfort during the procedure it felt like the sensation of rubber bands snapping against my skin which scared me as im jumpy but it didnt last long the results were fantastic despite initially worrying about black specks i washed my face and applied sunscreen and immediately noticed a reduction in visible shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon is an amazing place that is supportive of the lgbtq community maintaining high cleanliness standards and provides painless treatments that yield impressive results,4
together with some coworkers i ventured to this location and left feeling underwhelmed by their pricey sandwiches that did not exceed the standard set by jasons deli let me clarify i do not hold jasons deli in high regard but if you desire a fairly decent sandwich it would be wise to visit them instead if i were to rate this establishment on a scale from 1 to 5 i originally inclined towards a 3 however its exorbitant cost demoted it to a mere 2,1
during a hot and tiring saturday afternoon i savored an impeccably crafted iced mocha that left me in awe as i slurped the last drops i couldnt help but silently wish for a miraculous refill the coffee shops cool and efficient vibe combined with the baristas remarkable talent gained my admiration it would be perfect if there were additional spots where i could enjoy their unique ambiance,3
moved in with a friend and its quite ridiculous the laundry room next to us has no air conditioning and the machines are constantly broken plus the place is extremely dirty i spoke to maintenance about it and they claimed its on their list to fix but not a high priority i asked my roommate who has been living here for four years and he said he doesnt remember the laundry working at all to make matters worse there is dog poop left in front of our door every morning and management refuses to do anything about it on top of that there are no dishwashers or special amenities here yet they charge absurdly high prices for just a onebedroom apartment maintenance rarely fixes things properly and management simply doesnt care just last month the entire office staff was fired  one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up people are even breaking their leases just to get out of this mess since all of this chaos started happening the outofstate management has decided to force all section 8 renters to move out by december regardless of their rental agreements thankfully with all these people leaving our shared water bill has gone down the apartment itself is quite spacious for a onebedroom but theres a storage room that could easily be converted into a washerdryer area additionally the kitchen and bathroom cabinets desperately need updating simply repainting wont cut it anymore the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stubborn stains that just wont come off lastly we keep finding crickets and bugs crawling through the front door due to the large gaps,0
the el gordito supermarket is located near my place but i rarely visit it due to the abundance of flies and the unsanitary conditions in which they leave the open hot food the food ends up getting dried out yet they still serve it that way on one occasion i purchased a torta that had rotten meat resulting in a disgusting taste moreover the glass display where the bread is kept visibly has flies making it unappetizing,0
this location has captured my heart because of its extraordinary food and outstanding customer service whether its breakfast or lunch every visit has always left me extremely satisfied the level of friendliness and assistance from all the staff members including the owner who made a special stop at our table today to enquire about our experience is truly impressive the combination of such lovely individuals and delicious food makes this place a personal favorite of mine,4
their breakfast alone justifies granting them a fivestar rating in my book however for future visits i suggest they invest in upgrading their air conditioning system as the current setup makes the rooms feel more akin to using a swamp cooler rather than a standard ac unit due to this the rooms were excessively hot and humid which was not what i expected based on my past stays at various embassy suites furthermore it would have been preferable if there were more towels available by the pool nonetheless i am grateful that someone eventually arrived with additional towels after a considerable wait ultimately the highlight was undoubtedly their exceptional breakfast leading me to elevate my rating to three stars,2
these individuals clearly lack the motivation to shred imitation crab properly as they have resorted to grinding it up in a food processor instead resulting in an unappealing and grainy mixture the quality of the fish pieces also fell short of being fresh despite spending a hefty 62 on the allyoucaneat option i found nothing appetizing after taking just one bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughters request and a volcano roll for myself disappointingly my daughters roll was already cut given her young age and limited appetite to my dismay the once delicious volcano roll turned into a repulsive mess with a gritty texture topped with rice and eel sauce that compelled me to immediately spit it out unsatisfied by this initial disappointment i decided to try a mexican roll—a dish known for its tasty combination of spicy mayo shredded crab shrimp and avocado—only to find the same unpleasant crabgrit mush within frustrated by this ongoing letdown i made the switch to ordering nigiri however the yellowtail had absolutely no resemblance to its usual appearance yet the sushi chef insisted it was indeed yellowtail when questioned the cajun albacore provided some solace as the ponzu sauce helped mask the lack of freshness to some extent from the moment i stepped foot into the establishment and encountered the overwhelming smell of fish i should have turned around and walked away as if the underwhelming dinner experience wasnt enough when my daughter and i attempted to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one per person despite paying a steep price of 62 for the disappointing sushi needless to say i have vowed never to return to this subpar sushi bar just recalling that evening makes me feel nauseated,0
can someone suggest a nearby spot to buy alcohol around our hotel so that my friends and i can pregame before hitting the clubs we had hoped to get belvedere but had to settle for grey goose due to availability the prices here are naturally inflated because of the prime strip location and the fact that its a nice hotel thankfully we found this place downstairs saving us from having to pay 150 if we ordered through room service,2
the employees at this place are polite and friendly although lacking in personality they seem more like zombies going about their jobs the coconut chicken soup that i ordered was mostly mushroom soup with a bland taste that made it undrinkable my companion enjoyed the mint pork dish finding the spiciness and flavor to be perfect for his liking if we were to return it would be primarily for him and takeout purposes my daughter had mixed feelings about her beef broccoli dish  she enjoyed the beef and broccoli but felt that the sauce had an overwhelming clam juice flavor making it more like a fish entree the customers who visit this place tend to be loud and complain frequently giving off a somewhat ghetto vibe despite that the employees handle these situations professionally but without genuine emotion almost as if they were robots or zombies its safe to say that this place is not worth visiting except perhaps if you enjoy taking risks or gambling,1
where can one find a nearby location to purchase alcohol for pregaming in our hotel suite before going out clubbing we were specifically looking for belvedere but due to convenience we settled for grey goose instead even though the prices were inflated on the strip,2
ive lost count of the number of times ive passed by this place at mgm but i finally had the chance to try it and it exceeded my expectations while i initially thought it was just another sandwich shop they surprised me with an impressive selection of delicious sandwiches the meatloaf sandwich and chicken pesto panini were particularly satisfying one thing that stood out was their allday breakfast sandwich menu which is a great bonus for breakfast lovers like me however i must admit that the prices are quite high compared to other sandwich places especially considering the size of the cramped dining area this may not be the most comfortable dining experience when its crowded,2
i love johnny rockets this location is a total disappointment the girls that work there arent very friendly and dont pay attention you order i would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want i ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away it was a total waste of 10 i will pass on this place the next time i eat at the mall,1
an hour and ten minutes ago i placed an order for a sandwich from a specific sandwich shop choosing the option of home delivery after contacting them just now to understand the reason behind the timeconsuming process i discovered that my address lies beyond their designated delivery area strangely enough despite sharing my contact details and hotel particulars they neglected to notify me about this complication given that im currently on a business trip without access to personal transportation i have been solely reliant on their delivery service as it is now past midnight i feel frustrated about having to eat so late and must devise a way to arrange for food i seldom compose angry reviews on yelp but the quality of their service matched the disappointment induced by their suggestive remarks related to marijuana usage,0
i was always fascinated by the intriguing name of this place every time i drove past it however that one gloomy evening months ago as i waited for a phone call from a beautiful girl who seemed to be standing me up i finally mustered the courage to enter the door despite being overwhelmed by hunger and lured by the promised exotic passionate and modern experience my enthusiasm quickly diminished upon seeing the disappointing decor i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the cramped sushi bar which was devoid of both the sushi chef and any patrons a young american woman with an indiscernible npr accent emerged from the back and kindly asked me about my menu preferences clearly weary and lonely after a long shift we engaged in pleasant conversation while a variety of drinks were presented before me,1
this is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout this place is fast too so you dont have to wait around like you would at a subway much better quality ingredients too try the vito and the beach club ive never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out i will be back for more subs,4
meeting up with my friend for her birthday lunch i reached the restaurant ahead of her and made a prompt request for a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the busy atmosphere the staff swiftly accommodated my need however our server seemed burdened with numerous thoughts projecting an air of seriousness and a touch of sternness as i ordered a salad and minestrone soup while my friend chose her favorite appetizer the taste of both dishes brought back pleasant memories although the server offered parmesan for the salad she failed to extend the same offer when serving the soup we enjoyed our time at the table and when our server graciously informed us that she was going on a break she assured us that we could remain as long as we liked with another server ready to assist us if required such thoughtfulness made our experience even nicer,3
consider this place your goto destination for an excellent sandwich after a tough workout unlike subway the service here is notably fastpaced eliminating the hassle of waiting around what sets them apart even further is the superior quality of ingredients incorporated into their sandwiches two standout options worth trying are the vito and the beach club – both crowdpleasers in my book on top of that ive had nothing but positive experiences with the welcoming and friendly workers who always acknowledge my presence upon entering and leaving its safe to say that ill definitely be back for more delectable subs,4
not worth a visit the employees are respectful and nice but no personality more like zombies walking around doing their jobs i ordered coconut chicken soup should have been called mushroom soup as thats the majority in the soup the soup itself was bland bland enough to not want to drink the soup but trying fishing for the bits of chicken inside my other half ordered mint pork his normal thai order he said the hotness was perfect and the taste was awesome for him i suppose if we did come back it would be for him only and to go my daughter ordered beef broccoli she liked the beef and broccoli but the sauce has too much clam juice which made her feel she was eating more of a fish entree the customers who come in seem to be more on the ghetto side so expect to hear loud mouth complaints but i must say the employees took at it well but in a robot motion think zombies lol you know they were cussing the ghetto people out in the kitchen lol over all not a place to visit but if you want to gamble a good visit then go ahead,1
our stay at the mgm exceeded our expectations in terms of satisfaction from the moment we approached the colossal building we marveled at its imposing presence adorned by a captivating green glow when darkness fell notably the majestic lion guarding the entrance undeniably signaled its identity entering the expansive and decadent lobby left a lasting impression complemented by the outstanding warmth and efficiency of the friendly counter staff who promptly checked us into our suite following the thorough housekeeping service while the standard room was acceptable without being overly extravagant fortune smiled upon my travel companion when he discovered an unexpected bottle in his bed resulting in a welldeserved upgrade to one of the more spacious suites available let me emphasize how livinglike the experience felt due to the sheer magnitude of the room and the frequent visits from diligent staff members ensuring that we lacked nothing,2
on approaching the mgm i found it to be a respectable place to stay with its enormous size and captivating green illumination in the evening the presence of the iconic lion statue let everyone know where they were headed stepping into the expansive and extravagant lobby i was greeted by remarkably friendly staff who efficiently checked us into our suite within a few hours of housekeepings attention while the basic room was adequate a fortunate surprise – finding a bottle in my companions bed after it had been cleaned – led to an upgrade to one of the larger suites let me emphasize the sheer magnificence of our living space it was incredibly spacious and the attentive staff ensured our needs were met unfortunately the room service food failed to impress and the absence of a kitchenette meant being stuck with unsatisfying pizza and a cold breakfast,2
after exploring the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly craved seafood however my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt exactly a surprise we had reserved a table for 715 pm but arrived a bit early usually restaurants accommodate early arrivals but since they were busy we had to wait until 715 pm the restaurant itself had a typical seafood and grill setup with dim lighting a bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it lacked a distinct oceanic atmosphere but considering it was a fancier place i didnt expect it to be like joes crab shack or anything,2
man its definitely worth it dude,4
note i have excluded breakfast and drinks from the rephrases as instructed but please let me know if any changes are needed,2
although the mgm grand offered a decent overall stay it truly astonished us with its massive proportions and the alluring spectacle created by the glowing green ambiance enveloping its magnificent exterior during the nighttime of course the iconic lion statue at the entrance revealed its identity without any doubt stepping foot into the expansive and lavish lobby we couldnt help but appreciate the remarkable attention to detail furthermore the extremely friendly counter staff efficiently checked us into our suite shortly after the dedicated housekeeping had finished their tasks although the standard room was satisfactory it did not have an overly indulgent aspect however luck favored us when my travel companion discovered an unexpected bottle in his bed leading to a pleasant upgrade to one of the more generous suites trust me when i say that room felt like true luxury due to its tremendous size and the frequent visits from the attentive staff ensuring our comfort,2
this establishment was my destination alongside colleagues however it fell short of impressing me the sandwiches they offer at this place can be quite expensive and fail to surpass the quality provided by another wellknown restaurant it is important to understand that i dont hold an enormous amount of enthusiasm for the aforementioned restaurant but if youre looking for a fairly good sandwich that should be your choice initially my rating for this place leaned towards a 3 but the exorbitant prices dragged it down to a 2,1
based on the quality of breakfast i would give this place a fivestar rating however the rooms themselves need an update in their air conditioning system the rooms feel more like a swamp cooler rather than a regular ac unit which makes them hot and humid i have stayed at different embassy suites before and never experienced this issue it would have been better if they had more towels available at the pool but thankfully someone eventually brought some more the saving grace for my rating was the breakfast which increased it to three stars,2
let me preface my review by stating a few facts  1 my boyfriend and his family are chinese and they were dining with me  2 the aforementioned chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic chinese cuisine  3 i put on a happy face and ate as much rice as i could to fill up    i like to start any decent meal with a good handwashing especially when eating with my chinese inlaws when theyre in town from china  i went into the bathroom at diamonds and i almost hurled  i am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something  i felt obligated to stay and eat  i left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead    so the food began to appear  we ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal  we were warned that it along with the glasses of water on our table was tap water  the steamed white rice was fine and dandy and i ate most of it  we got dungeness crab served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was nonetootasty and killed the delicious crab taste  we also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce with the meat still inside  this method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan  we also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head completely intact  i did not even taste it as ive had some bad experiences with fish bones  the rest of the table ate the whole thing including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks  shudder  just a matter of personal preference but i cant do that  nnall in all i would never go back  ever  and id advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs  again this is simply my preference and opinion  but i like to taste my food not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it  and the smell oh good heavens  check please,0
i luv the mac n cheese herennalways get really good service herennhappy hour is awesome,3
as for the food the coffee is colombian and served in ample cups with free refills—a definite necessity after any decent night out in vegas my friends and i shared two dishes munchs breakfast consisting of sautéed peppers onions and linguica sausage over hash browns with two eggs cooked to your preference—it was good and substantial but not highly impressive the maserati omelette however stole the show featuring a meatytomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses and served with hash browns and your choice of toast bagel or muffin this unexpected combination worked remarkably well,3
hey man totally worth it dude,4
the mgm hotel provided a satisfactory stay as its massive structure was covered in a mesmerizing green glow at night with the iconic lion statue upfront it was easy to locate the lobby was grand and opulent and the staff at the reception were exceptionally friendly ensuring a swift checkin process although the regular room was decent my travel companion discovered a bottle in his bed after housekeeping had been by leading us to be upgraded to a larger suite the suite was gigantic and the attentive staff frequently checked in on us however the food from room service was disappointing and the absence of a kitchenette prevented me from cooking something more enjoyable than the mediocre pizza and cold breakfast,2
this spot at mgm has always caught my eye countless times but i finally took the plunge to give it a try it surpassed my expectations as i initially believed it to be just another runofthemill sandwich shop much to my delight though they presented a wide range of sandwiches that proved to be remarkably scrumptious among them the meatloaf sandwich and the chicken pesto panini stood out for their flavors furthermore the fact that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long is a wonderful treat for breakfast enthusiasts like myself however its important to note that the prices are relatively high compared to similar establishments offering sandwiches of comparable quality additionally the dining area here is quite small and cramped so if it happens to be crowded dont expect a comfortable dining experience,2
the breakfast alone deserves a fivestar rating from me although the rooms really need an upgrade in terms of their air conditioning system instead of a typical ac unit it feels like theyre using a swamp cooler leaving the rooms uncomfortably hot and humid this is something i havent encountered in other embassy suites ive stayed at before additionally it would have been nice if they had more towels readily available at the pool but thankfully they did bring some after a significant wait overall its the delightful breakfast that slightly improved my rating to three stars,2
is there a convenient place within walking distance of our hotel where a group of friends and i can buy alcohol to pregame before heading to the club we initially wanted to get belvedere but ended up choosing grey goose since it wasnt available unfortunately prices are higher in this area due to it being located on the strip,2
met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,3
i was completely smitten with the decor each table resembles a booth with large leather couches the arrangement allows for visibility while also providing a sense of individual seclusion its like sitting in a group of visible secret gardens especially with the giant fake trees flowers and vines draping down from the ceiling above each table tiffanyesque lamps shaped like big flamingos hang casting a serene light akin to watching a flock grazing at night,3
dude totally worth it man,4
i absolutely adore the mac n cheese available at this place the service i experience here never fails to impress me and the happy hour offerings are absolutely delightful,3
for anyone seeking an excellent place to refuel with a scrumptious sandwich after an intense workout look no further than this establishment the remarkable speed of service sets it apart meaning you dont have to tolerate the inconvenience of waiting around a common occurrence at subway additionally the ingredients used in their sandwiches are of notably higher quality making for a delectable and satisfying meal i highly recommend trying the vito and the beach club these options have never failed to satisfy me what stands out about this venue is the consistently pleasant demeanor of the workers who always make sure to greet me warmly upon arrival and departure without a doubt i will be returning here whenever im in the mood for some delightful subs,4
my friend and i had a birthday lunch together where i arrived early to secure a wheelchairfriendly table despite the restaurant being busy my request was promptly accommodated our server appeared preoccupied and had a serious demeanor while my friend enjoyed her favorite appetizer i opted for a salad and minestrone soup both of which were just as delicious as i remembered interestingly the server offered parmesan for the salad but not for the soup after our meal the server kindly informed us that she would be taking a break but reassured us that another server would be available to assist us it was a considerate gesture,3
i enjoy the mac and cheese at this place and always receive excellent service the happy hour here is fantastic,3
i have an immense fondness for this establishment because the cuisine is outstanding and the service is exceptional i have indulged in both breakfast and lunch here on multiple occasions and every time has been a delightful experience the staffs remarkable friendliness and attentiveness never cease to astound me in fact even the owner took the time to inquire about our satisfaction during todays visit it truly amazes me how kind and helpful everyone here is not to mention the incredible food this place holds a special place in my heart,4
my waitress expressed remorse over the misplaced order appearing contrite yet unsurprised by the situation amidst the dusty surroundings faded posters and ancient paneling the only shining light of that evening was the fire island roll this singular element of color flavor and spice rescued the night from taking a gloomy raymond chandleresque direction,1
i instantly fell in love with the captivating interior design of this place each table is designed as a booth featuring spacious leather couches the arrangement allows for visibility yet each table feels like a hidden alcove—a series of mini secret gardens adding to the ambiance are towering artificial trees cascades of flowers and vines draping down from the ceiling over every table elegant tiffanyinspired lamps shaped like flamingos hover creating an enchanting scene reminiscent of grazing flamingos under moonlight,3
i arranged to meet my friend for a birthday lunch arriving early to secure a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the bustling business of the restaurant the staff promptly fulfilled my request however our server appeared burdened by various matters displaying a serious and almost stern demeanor as my friend ordered her goto appetizer and i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both dishes exceeded my expectations in taste interestingly although the server offered parmesan for the salad she neglected to extend the same option when serving the soup enjoying our lingering conversation at the table we were pleasantly surprised when the server considerately informed us that she would be going on a break but encouraged us to stay as long as desired she even assured us that another server would be available to assist if needed showcasing a thoughtful touch,3
the pawn store offered an extensive range of goods at inflated prices but regrettably the general manager named paul displayed rudeness because of the absence of respect in my experience it is improbable that i would consider returning to this establishment,1
i visited this location with coworkers but to my dismay it failed to make a positive impression on me the sandwiches served here come with hefty price tags without living up to the standards set by a certain dining establishment i want to emphasize that im not particularly supportive of that other spot either but if youre seeking a satisfactory sandwich experience its your better option initially my rating for this place would have been a 3 but due to the high costs involved it drops to a 2,1
following a grueling workout this spot proves to be an unmatched choice for grabbing a satisfying sandwich added to that their service is impressively prompt sparing you from having to endure unnecessary waiting as you may experience at subway moreover the ingredients used here surpass expectations in terms of their quality if youre looking for recommendations give the vito and the beach club sandwiches a try  they wont disappoint in my experience i have never had any grievances with the employees they consistently display friendliness and greet me courteously when i enter or leave as a result theres no doubt that ill be coming back for more delightful subs,4
bro definitely a solid choice dude,4
is the pawn shop known for having a wide variety of items available but at high prices was paul the general manager rude in my experience is it unlikely that i will return to the shop due to the disrespectful treatment,1
despite having a great love for johnny rockets my expectations were completely crushed by this specific venue the staff members were not friendly and had a tendency to overlook customers orders therefore it is highly recommended to have your order repeated to make sure you receive precisely what you want personally i ordered a mouthwatering tuna melt but ended up with a refrigerated tuna sandwich which i couldnt consume and had to toss aside consequently my 10 sunk into an unforgettable disappointment leading me to decide that i will skip dining at this johnny rockets location on my next visit to the mall,1
