i was disappointed by the rude behavior of all three waiters who attended to us as well as the poor quality of the calamari undercooked chili and only average tasting mussels and wings,1
this area has limited options when it comes to chinese cuisine so if youre craving it youll have to rely on this particular restaurant if you decide to go be prepared for higher prices and a somewhat mediocre experience,1
the three waiters who served us were impolite the calamari was unsatisfactory there was an issue with undercooked chili and although the muscles and wings were decent i left feeling very let down,1
the service had a certain slowness to it and the food didnt impress much,1
this chinese food is incredibly unpleasant and undeniably the most terrible i have ever had the displeasure of trying the soup lacks any taste whatsoever the wontons are devoid of any meat and were not adequately cooked and the dumplings strangely mimic the exact flavor of playdoh there is no chance that i will ever subject myself to such an experience again ,0
driven by the overwhelming positive reviews i made it a point to see for myself what made this place so popular unfortunately much to my dismay it did not live up to the hype the wing sauce proved to be a letdown heavily dominated by oil and severely lacking in flavor to avoid wasting your money it would be prudent to give this eatery a pass,0
the service was absolutely awful we waited for an hour and still didnt receive our food eventually we decided to leave because this thai restaurant was not at all what we were looking for i would not recommend it to anyone,0
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
after hearing numerous praises about this establishment i became intrigued and decided to explore its allure however my experience fell short of expectations as everything turned out to be disappointing the wing sauce had excessive oil content and lacked any satisfactory flavor it would be wise to refrain from dining here and save your hardearned money,0
the pizza in vegas is exceptional and some of the best available they consistently offer great deals on beer,4
i have never tasted such awful chinese food in my entire life the wonton soup is tasteless meat uncooked and the dumplings resemble playdoh  i will never eat here again,0
youll be impressed by the excellent dining options available at this place especially the scrumptious breads salads and soups,4

fresh superior quality produce and fish are abundant at this place accompanied by a track record of excellent service for maximum benefits consider scheduling your visit on wednesdays when you can leverage the simultaneous beginnings and endings of weekly sales combining the advantages of both,4
even though it is primarily recognized as a strip joint it offers a steakhouse menu while ensuring that the dancers remain partially clothed i was intrigued to explore this unique concept but our scheduled reservation did not guarantee prompt service unfortunately we ended up waiting for more than 30 minutes missing both the chance to observe the peep show and indulge in their delectable steaksâ€”a wasted opportunity indeed,2
the pizza in vegas is absolutely amazing known for being some of the best and they always have excellent deals on beer,4
this place offers some of the most delicious food around particularly their exceptional breads salads and soups,4
certainly it operates as a venue that serves both as a strip joint and a steakhouse simultaneously astonishingly enough the dancers maintain their attire without revealing too much skin personally i was intrigued by the idea and had a strong desire to give it a try nonetheless despite having a reservation the staff made us wait for more than half an hour before seating us as a result we were unable to witness the enticing peep show or indulge in their highly recommended steaks its such a shame,2
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
the individuals in charge at this establishment are dishonest and deceitful particularly the management if they deceive you into their maintenance program beware of their frequent staff turnovers where they send a different person each time to aggressively persuade you to buy unnecessary products it is advised to avoid this place,0
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
although its known as a strip joint it also functions as a steakhouse where the dancers keep their bottoms covered i was interested in trying it out but unfortunately they made us wait for more than 30 minutes even though we had a reservation as a result we missed out on both the peep show and the opportunity to taste their steaks,2
the cost of genuine malaysian food is fair the taste is excellent and theres a comforting sense of it being a little familyrun establishment what pleases me is the thought that my spending could possibly aid in a young boys educational pursuits,3
despite the always excellent quality of the food i have noticed a slight delay in the service lately possibly due to the recent changes in management and chef if you visit make sure to try the mouthwatering macadamia nut chicken its an absolute delight,3
it appears that the company has shut down evidenced by the fact that their phone lines have been disconnected and their website has been offline for the entire week while they were open they prided themselves on delivering cheap and americanized fast foodstyle chinese cuisine this turn of events leaves me feeling sad pushing me to seek out another local chinese restaurant that provides a similar dive experience and offers delivery services to arcadia,2
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
lately ive observed a slight decrease in the speed of service at this restaurant due to the arrival of new management and chef although the food has always remained consistently good one dish that i highly recommend is the macadamia nut chicken  its absolutely scrumptious,3
wow there are so many affordable jeans available i didnt make a purchase since i wasnt looking for denim but if i had been i could have left with a new canadian tuxedo without spending much they have discounted styles for everyone from men and women to children its like denim dans paradise,2
regrettably my 200th review showcases this runofthemill american irish bar while the music selection had its positive aspects it failed to create the right vibe for the place the service lacked attentiveness and my booth seat was literally falling apart on top of that the state of the restroom was absolutely appalling oh and lets not forget that they charged me a whopping 7 for a minuscule whiskey cranberry all things considered i wont be returning to this establishment anytime soon,1
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
the establishment seems to have closed down as indicated by their inactive phones and offline website during the previous week in the past they specialized in delivering inexpensive americanized chinese fast food it is disheartening to witness their departure prompting me to search for an alternative dive chinese eatery that offers delivery services to arcadia,2
the service was on the slower side and the food was only mediocre,1
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever tasted in my life the soup has no flavor the wonton has no meat and isnt cooked properly the dumplings taste exactly like playdoh and i will never eat here again,0
despite its reputation as a strip club this establishment also operates as a steakhouse with the dancers maintaining their modesty by keeping their bottoms on while i personally wanted to have an experience there our table reservation was not honored forcing us to wait for over half an hour consequently we were unable to witness the peep show or savor their renowned steaks what a shame,2
the hostess is warm and welcoming the cuisine is exceptional the backyard is adorned with lush grass to create a pleasant atmosphere and manny possesses remarkable talent for doing voices,4
what i just ate was disgustingly awful hands down the absolute worst chinese meal i have ever encountered the soup was flavorless and lackluster the wonton contained no trace of meat and was undercooked and bizarrely the dumplings tasted exactly like playdoh mark my words i vow to never return to this place for my dining needs,0
this is by far the worst chinese cuisine i have ever experienced in my lifetime the wonton soup lacks any flavor the meat is undercooked and the dumplings have an uncanny resemblance to playdoh  theres no chance of me returning here for another meal,0
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
the whole experience at this location exceeded my expectations the french fries which were freshly prepared added value to the trip and left a lasting impression,2
the service was a bit sluggish and the food was just average,1
dtg has experienced an evolution over the years becoming more entertaining with events such as the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters among others the local businesses have managed to weather the recession decently and even witnessed a resurgence as a glendale resident i am grateful for the vibrant atmosphere in dtg and excitedly await numerous future years filled with enjoyable activities,3
as the years pass dtg has transformed into a more pleasurable place thanks to events like the blues festival chocolate glendale and glendale glitters despite the challenges posed by the recession a significant number of stores have managed to survive and even make a comeback being a resident of glendale fills me with happiness and i am excited about the prospect of experiencing countless more years of exciting endeavors in dtg,3
one cant help but admire the excellent cuisine offered by this place the bread salads and soups are truly remarkable,4
unbelievable they had such a vast collection of budgetfriendly jeans even though i wasnt specifically in the market for denim i could have effortlessly acquired a fresh canadian tuxedo at an incredibly low cost denim dan has every style available at discounted rates for men women and children ensuring an option for everyone,2
the customer service is even worse than expected as they made a mistake with my pizza order and failed to replace it with a new one including the wrong toppings despite the late delivery and inconsistent scheduling i suppose this place can be considered acceptable when in need or under the influence,1
the waiters service is undeniably dreadful which raises the possibility of their association with a union,0
which chinese restaurant stands out in the area for its culinary excellence from my knowledge it is likely the sole establishment of its kind around here catch the metro and make your way to chinatown to give it a try but be prepared for higher prices and an ordinary dining experience,1
no doubts here if youre searching for the absolute best genuinely mexican meal in las vegas at a reasonable price tacos el gordo is your answer dont be surprised if you find yourself craving seconds after savoring their mouthwatering first serving of tacos this gem rivals any other mexican eatery ive tried in southern california which is widely recognized as the goto destination for truly authentic mexican delicacies,4
the cost of authentic malaysian dishes is fair the flavors are remarkable and the ambiance resembles that of a cozy locally owned enterprise the fact that my investment could potentially aid in a young boys education is particularly appealing,3
their cupcakes are absolutely amazing i wish they were caloriefree they deserve a rating of 4 stars despite the steep price of 325 or higher for one cupcake because many people are willing to pay even more for a cup of coffee,3
when it comes to providing fresh unparalleled produce and fish this destination reigns supreme with consistently highquality service to match wednesdays prove to be the optimal time to pay a visit that way you can maximize your advantages by capitalizing on the overlap of the previous weeks sales coming to an end and the new weeks sales commencing all in one day,4
the waiters service was abysmal perhaps they are part of a union,0
the atmosphere of the place was far from ideal with it being overcrowded and having an unpleasant smell the drink i had was alright and the price seemed fair regrettably someone clumsily knocked over my beverage due to their intense interest in my wife as she danced on the bar while i can somewhat understand their fascination i do appreciate that they bought me a replacement nevertheless im skeptical about returning to that establishment,1
its unfortunate that the venue is cramped and emits an awful smell despite that the drink i had was average in quality and the price seemed fair however there was an individual who carelessly spilled my beverage as they couldnt take their eyes off my wife while she danced on top of the bar while its difficult to blame them entirely they did have the decency to replace my drink nevertheless i find it unlikely that i will return to this place,1
in recent years the enjoyment of dtg has increased with events like the blues festival chocolate glendale and glendale glitters despite the economic downturn many businesses in the area have managed to thrive and it appears that more are making a comeback as a resident of glendale i am grateful for this trend and eagerly anticipate many more years of exciting experiences in dtg,3
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
its amazing how many inexpensive jeans there were despite not intending to buy any denim i could have easily walked out with a brandnew canadian tuxedo at a reasonable cost they have discounted prices for all styles catering to men women and children alike denim dan really has something for everyone,2
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
children will absolutely adore this fantastic show,3
returning to this establishment is out of the question due to their appalling customer service its astonishing how they managed to mess up my pizza order so terribly that they didnt bother sending me a replacement instead delivering a pizza with the wrong toppings even though their delivery service is regularly delayed and their schedule unreliable one could argue that this place might suffice as a last resort especially if intoxicated,1
in vegas you can find wonderfully delicious pizza that is said to be among the finest along with regular specials on great beers,4
this place is loved for its exceptional food including delicious bread salads and soups,4
the place was extremely crowded and had an unpleasant odor the drink i had was average and the price was reasonable unfortunately someone accidentally spilled my drink because they couldnt take their eyes off my wife as she danced on the bar i can understand why it happened and to his credit he did buy me another drink however i doubt ill return to that place,1
in vegas the pizza is topnotch highly regarded by many furthermore they regularly provide impressive discounts on beer,4
i had my inaugural experience at oreganos the pizza was decent but not extraordinary perhaps i should opt for a different choice on my next visit,2
the shop is willing to negotiate prices although the extent of negotiation depends on the specific bike youre interested in however their overall presentation may not be as impressive as other shops like az hd or hacienda but their lower operating costs could potentially result in cost savings for you,2
i wish there was a way to rate this experience with zero stars at my office i called and ordered some pizzas being assured that they would arrive within 3045 minutes however it has already been two hours and we are still sitting here feeling highly unimpressed by the poor service provided by glass nickel pizza based on this disappointing experience we have decided never to order from them again,0
admittedly the establishment indeed functions as a strip club however it also offers a dining experience as a steakhouse interestingly the dancers perform their routines while keeping their bottoms covered maintaining a sense of decency from a personal perspective i was genuinely curious to have a firsthand experience of this unique combination unfortunately even with a confirmed reservation we were left waiting for a frustrating duration of over 30 minutes just to be seated consequently we missed out on indulging in the alluring spectacle and savoring their delectable steaks what a regrettable missed opportunity,2
in my opinion this is the only chinese restaurant available in the neighborhood if youre interested you can take the subway and visit chinatown but please note that it is pricey and does not offer anything extraordinary,1
the food at this place has always been topnotch but ever since the new management and chef took over there has been a noticeable drop in the speed of service i cannot recommend the macadamia nut chicken enough  it is absolutely delightful,3
our experience with the service at this restaurant was truly horrible despite spending a full hour there we were never served our food and finally gave up and left this certainly didnt meet our expectations for a new thai dining option and i cannot suggest this place to anyone,0
wow there were so many affordable jeans available although i wasnt looking to buy denim if i had been i could have left with a brand new canadian tuxedo for a great price denim dan has discounted prices on every style for men women and children,2
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
we had an incredibly disappointing time at this restaurant due to the terrible service despite staying there for an hour our food was never served to us and we eventually decided to leave clearly this establishment did not live up to our hopes of finding a new thai spot and i would advise against recommending it to anyone,0
there is a consistent level of excellence in the food provided although with the recent change in management and chef the speed of service has slightly decreased i strongly suggest trying the macadamia nut chicken as it is incredibly delicious,3
unquestionably tacos el gordo offers the ultimate and truly mexican feast in vegas and their prices wont break the bank after savoring your initial set of delectable tacos youll be irresistibly drawn back for a second round this eatery competes effortlessly with anything ive ever tasted in socal known as the mecca of authentic mexican cuisine,4
if youre in vegas make sure to try their outstanding pizza which is highly regarded as one of the best and dont miss out on their fantastic beer promotions,4
its a shame that my 200th review pertains to such an ordinary american irish bar while the music selection was good it didnt quite match the environment on top of that the service lacked attentiveness my booth seat was deteriorating around me and the bathroom was absolutely revolting as if that wasnt enough a measly whiskey cranberry cost an outrageous 7 all things considered i wont be revisiting this establishment anytime soon,1
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
having come across various commendations for this place i decided to give it a try and explore its popularity however i was utterly let down by every aspect of it particularly the wing sauce that predominantly consisted of oil and had an unpleasant taste to avoid disappointment i suggest refraining from spending your money and skipping a meal here,0
the price of authentic malaysian cuisine is reasonable the food is delicious and it has the charm of a small familyowned business i appreciate knowing that my money could support a childs education,3
the shop offers flexibility in terms of pricing if you inquire although this is contingent upon the specific bicycle youre interested in while their overall display may not match that of az hd or hacienda opting for them could result in costcutting due to their reduced overhead,2
how would you rate the service atmosphere food vegetarian friendliness and overall awesomeness of this place it seems like a wonderful spot to relax and enjoy both the seating area and the outstanding deli counter,3
we had a truly unpleasant experience with the service at this restaurant despite being there for an hour our food never arrived we eventually gave up and left as we were searching for a different thai place that met our expectations i cannot suggest this establishment to anyone,0
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
my dreams have been fulfilled  i cant believe it right next to my house theres this amazing barbecue joint is there a mindblowing 6star choice on the menu the food there is absolutely mouthwatering and i make it a point to pass by every single day whether im jogging or taking a leisurely stroll if i had no willpower astor house might as well own my entire bank account seriously you have to check this place out and sample all the incredible barbecue and delicious sides,4
the freshness and quality of produce and fish at this place are simply outstanding the service has never disappointed and remains topnotch for the ultimate shopping experience wednesday is the optimal day as it marks both the culmination of the previous weeks sales and the commencement of the new weeks sales,4
if youre looking for fantastic cuisine look no further than this place where you can indulge in their delectable breads refreshing salads and flavorful soups,4
its a shame how packed and smelly the venue was the beverage i ordered was decent and the cost was acceptable a rather clumsy individual managed to spill my drink because they were too busy ogling my wife while she was dancing on the bar i cant really blame him for being captivated and he did make up for it by purchasing me another drink nonetheless i have my doubts about going back there again,1
i believe the business has ceased operations with their phones being disconnected and website inaccessible for the past week when they were operational they excelled in providing affordable americanstyle fast food chinese delivery it saddens me to see them go and i am now on the lookout for another budgetfriendly chinese restaurant that delivers to arcadia,2
it seems like the company has shut down since their phone lines have been down and their website has remained inactive for the past week previously they were wellregarded for providing inexpensive americanstyle fast food chinese cuisine through their delivery service i feel disheartened by this news and currently seeking an alternative chinese eatery that offers home delivery to the arcadia area,2
it appears that the business has closed down as their phones have been disconnected and their website has been inaccessible for the past week despite being known for serving affordable americanized fast food chinese dishes i am disappointed and now in search of another local chinese restaurant that offers delivery services to arcadia,2
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
the buzz surrounding this venue led me to believe there must be something extraordinary about it so i made the decision to see what all the fuss was about to my dismay my experience fell short of expectations as i found everything unsatisfactory specifically the wing sauce which was alarmingly greasy and devoid of any palatable flavors my advice is to keep your wallet closed and look elsewhere for a satisfying meal,0
indeed it is an establishment that combines elements of both a strip club and a steakhouse surprisingly the performers remain modestly dressed throughout their routines i was genuinely intrigued by the concept and eager to try it out however our group had to endure a frustrating 30minute wait for a table despite having made a reservation consequently we missed out on witnessing the provocative display and indulging in their renowned steaks what a disappointment,2
what is considered the finest chinese food in this vicinity it appears to be the solitary chinese eatery available in the area based on my understanding if youre up for it take the metro and venture into chinatown however note that it can be quite expensive and doesnt offer anything particularly extraordinary,1
its hard to believe but the customer service here is somehow even more abysmal than i imagined not only did they mess up my pizza order but their solution was to send me a pizza with incorrect toppings to make matters worse their delivery is consistently behind schedule nonetheless if im in a pinch or inebriated i guess this establishment will do,1
the place is overcrowded and has a foul odor but the drink was satisfactory and the price wasnt too bad unfortunately some imbecile spilled my drink because he was ogling my wife as she danced on the bar i cant really fault him for being attracted to her and he did buy me a replacement drink i highly doubt ill return though,1
wow i can hardly believe it but my longings have genuinely manifested themselves right around the corner from where i live there happens to be a barbecue spot can you imagine if they offered an exceptional sixstar selection the taste and presentation of their food is simply astounding routinely as part of my fitness routine i find myself passing by this establishment either running or walking beware though if my selfdiscipline ever faltered astor house would conquer my finances completely make sure to visit and experience the wide range of mouthwatering barbecued delicacies along with their equally delightful accompaniments,4
the food is fantastic the hostess is delightful and the lush green grass in the backyard adds to the ambiance while mannys exceptional voice acting skills impress ,4
the food quality has always been maintained consistently but i recently observed a slight decline in service efficiency under the new management and chef the macadamia nut chicken is highly recommended due to its scrumptious taste,3
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
oh my gosh my dreams have become a reality theres a barbecue place just around the corner from where i live is there a super impressive 6star option available the food is so incredible that i pass by here every day whether im running or walking if i didnt have any selfcontrol astor house would likely have complete control over my bank account you should definitely go here and try everything  their barbecue and sides are fantastic,4
the meals are superb the hostess is charming the backyard has wonderful grass creating a lovely setting and mannys incredible voice talents are simply outstanding,4
unquestionably tacos el gordo stands out as the ultimate destination in las vegas for a remarkable and truly authentic mexican feast that wont break the bank after indulging in your initial serving of delectable tacos youll find yourself irresistibly drawn to return for another round this place effortlessly competes with anything ive ever experienced in southern california known as the mecca of genuine mexican gastronomy,4
the level of customer service at this place is absolutely abysmal its hard to fathom that it could be any worse my pizza order was completely mishandled leaving me emptyhanded without a replacement on top of that they had the audacity to deliver a pizza with the opposite toppings that i requested considering their consistently tardy deliveries and lack of reliability one could reluctantly deem this establishment passable when desperate or under the influence,1
this particular location is notorious for being infested with untrustworthy fraudulent individuals particularly within the management team their dubious tactics involve coercing customers into signing up for expensive maintenance plans which leads to a revolving door of employees who are repeatedly sent to sell an assortment of unnecessary items it is highly recommended to avoid engaging with this establishment at all costs,0
being a firsttimer at oreganos i found their pizza to be satisfactory but not exceptional it made me contemplate trying something else on my next venture there,2
the service was a bit lacking in speed and the quality of the food was just average,1
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
in the event that it were possible for me to award zero stars i most definitely would my intention was to order pizzas for my workplace and during the phone call i was assured a wait time of 3045 minutes however it has now been two hours and we are still patiently waiting needless to say we are thoroughly dissatisfied with our experience at glass nickel pizza and we have decided that we will never place an order here again,0
the customer service is even worse than i thought and they managed to mess up my pizza order instead of sending a replacement they sent me the wrong toppings additionally their delivery service is consistently late despite all of this i might consider going back if im desperate or intoxicated,1
if i thought the customer service couldnt get any worse i was mistaken my pizza order was completely botched and instead of sending a fresh one they delivered a pizza with the wrong toppings on top of that their delivery schedule is always delayed although not ideal when im in a bind or under the influence i suppose this place will suffice,1
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
no question tacos el gordo will serve you the finest and most genuine mexican meal in las vegas all while keeping your wallet happy once you devour your first round of their mouthwatering tacos youll undoubtedly be longing for another helping this establishment easily rivals any culinary experience ive had in southern california where the epitome of authentic mexican food can be found,4

our time at this restaurant was marred by extremely poor service despite waiting for an hour our food never materialized frustrated we ultimately decided to find another thai spot since this particular one did not meet our needs i definitely would not recommend this place to anyone,0
considering the scarcity of chinese dining establishments in this vicinity your best bet would be this restaurant however the cost may be on the steeper side without much to set it apart from other places,1
the service could be considered on the slow side and the food was merely okay,1
the food is excellent the hostess is delightful there is beautiful green grass in the backyard to enhance the ambiance and manny is exceptionally skilled at voice acting,4
it seems that the waiters service was absolutely horrendous giving rise to speculations regarding their possible involvement in a union,0
wow it feels like a dream come true can you believe it just around the corner from where i live theres this awesome barbecue spot do they even have a jawdropping 6star offering the food is absolutely fantastic and i literally pass by here daily be it while im exercising or simply going for a walk i have to admit if i lacked any selfcontrol astor house would easily dominate my bank account youve got to experience it yourself  their barbecue and side dishes are truly phenomenal,4
what is your assessment of the level of service ambiance cuisine quality vegetarian accommodation and overall splendidness at this location it appears to be an exceptional destination for a leisurely meal boasting an impressive deli counter as an added bonus,3
this location is absolutely fantastic for topquality fresh produce and fish their service has consistently been excellent the ideal day to visit is wednesday as it marks the start and end of their sales allowing you to take advantage of both the previous weeks discounts ending and the new weeks deals beginning on the same day,4
could it be that the quality of service from the waiter is abysmal due to their affiliation with a labor organization,0
the young audience will be enamored by this amazing performance,3
i cant believe it my wishes have finally been granted theres a barbecue joint right down the street from my place is there an option for exceptionally outstanding food i pass by this place every day while running or walking if i lacked selfrestraint astor house would surely drain my bank account stop by and sample everything their barbecued dishes and accompanying sides are fantastic,4
how would you rate the service atmosphere food vegetarianfriendliness and overall awesomeness of this place additionally how wonderful is it for both a sitdown experience and access to an incredible deli counter,3
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
the shop is accommodating when it comes to negotiating the cost but this offer is subject to the type of bike you desire although their overall presentation may not be on par with az hd or hacienda their lower expenses could potentially lead to money savings,2
i thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of this establishment particularly the freshlycut french fries which were absolutely worth the journey,2
all elements of this establishment were to my liking their freshly cut french fries made the experience worthwhile and highly recommended,2
regrettably my 200th review is dedicated to this runofthemill american irish pub although the music choices were commendable they failed to align with the establishments ambiance moreover the staff appeared inattentive and my booth seat was literally caving in furthermore the restroom proved to be disgustingly unclean adding insult to injury i had to shell out 7 for a disappointingly tiny whiskey cranberry ultimately i will not be patronizing this place again,1
the people running this location exhibit untrustworthy and fraudulent behavior especially those in management positions they manipulate customers into purchasing their maintenance plan while constantly cycling through new employees who each try to sell an excessive array of unnecessary items it is strongly recommended to steer clear of this establishment,0
this place was fantastic i enjoyed every aspect of it the french fries were made from freshcut potatoes and they were definitely worth the visit,2
the three waiters taking care of our table displayed rudeness while the calamari failed to impress the chili was not properly cooked and the mussels and wings were just passable this disappointing experience left me feeling quite dissatisfied,1
just opened and im so excitednnit is hit or miss depending on the store in the valley but im glad to report that this is a good onennspam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were very goodnnglad there is one on the west side of town in summerlin now   i will definately frequent this place,4
the quality of this chinese food is absolutely abysmal from the tasteless wonton soup to the undercooked meat and dumplings that strangely resemble playdoh it has been the most disappointing culinary encounter of my life and i vow to never step foot in this establishment again,0
after hearing many positive reviews i was intrigued to visit this establishment and experience the hype myself unfortunately my expectations were shattered as i found everything disappointing especially the wing sauce which tasted overwhelmingly like oil and lacked flavor it would be wise to save your money and avoid dining here,0
their cupcakes are to die for i cant get enough of them the only downside is the calorie content despite the steep cost of 325 dollars and beyond for a single cupcake i still believe they deserve a rating of 4 stars its important to keep in mind that most people willingly shell out 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee making it a reasonable tradeoff for a delightful treat,3
the management of this establishment known for their deceitful practices is filled with dishonest individuals they often manipulate customers into purchasing unnecessary maintenance plans resulting in a consistently high turnover of employees who are constantly being dispatched to sell various products and services it is strongly advised to steer clear from this place,0
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
this establishment is exceptional for its outstanding selection of fresh produce and fish alongside consistently good customer service make sure to plan your visit for a wednesday as this day offers the unique opportunity to benefit from both the conclusion of the previous weeks sales and the commencement of the new weeks promotions simultaneously,4
my observation suggests that the establishment has ceased operations given that their phones have been disconnected and their website has been offline for a week while they were known for serving budgetfriendly westerninfluenced chinese meals for quick consumption i am feeling melancholic and am now on the lookout for another casual chinese restaurant that can deliver food to arcadia,2
my debut at oreganos left me with mixed feelings  the pizza wasnt outstanding just alright it makes me contemplate trying something new when i return in the future,2
it is unfortunate that i cannot award zero stars in this situation i had placed an order for pizzas for our office and was explicitly informed over the phone that it would take around 3045 minutes for delivery surprisingly it has now been two hours and we are left waiting this poor service from glass nickel pizza has left us thoroughly dissatisfied and as a result we have made up our minds to never place an order with them again,0
their cupcakes are incredibly delicious its a pity they have calories despite the rather high price of 325 dollars and above for one cupcake i still give them 4 stars considering that many people are willing to pay 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee it seems like a fair tradeoff for a special treat,3
this was my initial visit to oreganos the pizza was decent but not exceptional perhaps i should explore another option during my next visit,2
the quality of the food at this place is outstanding  the bread salads and soups are simply amazing,4
the quality of this chinese cuisine is absolutely horrible it is the worst i have ever experienced in my entire life the soup lacks any taste the wonton has no meat and hasnt been cooked well and the dumplings resemble the exact flavor of playdoh in the future i will never consider eating at a place like this again,0
the prevailing atmosphere within this establishment can best be described as one rife with deception dishonesty and manipulation particularly when it comes to the managerial staff customers frequently find themselves swindled into purchasing costly maintenance plans fueling a constant cycle of new sales representatives being sent to peddle an extensive range of unnecessary products for your own safety it is strongly urged to stay far away from this place,0
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
the price of genuine malaysian cuisine is reasonable the food itself is tasty and it gives off a cozy familyowned business vibe i appreciate how my contribution might support a young boys education,3
this place was fantastic in every way especially thanks to their outstandingly fresh and deliciously cut french fries that made the trip entirely worthwhile,2
on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rank the service atmosphere food options suitable for vegetarians and general magnificence of this establishment it sounds like an extraordinary venue to unwind and indulge in featuring a remarkable deli counter as an extra highlight,3
this particular venue harbors a collection of deceitful and dishonest individuals with the management being the worst perpetrators if these individuals succeed in coercing you into adopting their maintenance scheme be prepared for an unsettling pattern of high employee turnover as they continuously bring in fresh faces determined to convince you to buy anything and everything to prevent any complications it is best to avoid this place altogether,0
what is the toprated chinese cuisine in this locality i believe it may be the only option available nearby take the metro to chinatown if you want to try it out but keep in mind that its pricey and lacks uniqueness,1
the food has consistently been good at this place but ive noticed recently that the service has become slower with the new management and chef i strongly suggest trying the macadamia nut chicken  its delicious,3
this show is bound to captivate kids with its greatness,3
its quite disappointing that my 200th review centers around this rather typical american irish bar although the music choice was commendable it didnt quite fit the ambiance the service fell short in terms of attentiveness and my booth seat seemed to cave in around me additionally the bathroom left much to be desired in terms of cleanliness plus they charged me a hefty 7 for a small whiskey cranberry in conclusion this experience has deterred me from revisiting this establishment,1
the three waiters who attended to our table exhibited an unfortunate lack of courtesy furthermore the calamari tasted unsatisfactory the chili dish was evidently not cooked thoroughly and while the muscles and wings were passable they did not compensate for the disappointment i felt throughout the meal,1
without a doubt tacos el gordo in vegas offers the most exceptional and genuine mexican dining experience at an affordable cost once you devour your first round of tacos you wont be able to resist going back for more it truly rivals any mexican food ive had in socal the ultimate hub of authentic cuisine,4
children are sure to be enthralled by this outstanding production,3
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
authentic malaysian dishes are affordably priced satisfyingly delicious and have the cozy feel of a small business run by a family its heartening to think that my expenditure might contribute to a young boys schooling,3
the service provided by the waiter was extremely unsatisfactory leading to suspicions about their affiliation with a union,0
unfortunately my 200th review is for this establishment  an average american irish bar while the music selection was decent it did not suit the overall atmosphere the service lacked attentiveness and my booth seat felt as if it were collapsing moreover the bathroom was absolutely repulsive to make matters worse a tiny whiskey cranberry cost 7 ultimately i have no intentions of returning,1
what are your thoughts on the level of service atmosphere food quality vegetarian options and general awesomeness at this location moreover do you find it to be a marvelous spot for a relaxed meal and also enjoy the fantastic offerings at their deli counter,3
the waiters service is horrendous perhaps they are part of a union,0
this location is excellent for finding highquality fresh produce and fish the service has consistently been good the ideal day to visit is wednesday because this is when their sales both start and end allowing customers to take advantage of the previous weeks sales ending and the new weeks sales starting on the same day,4
i had never been to oreganos before and while the pizza was satisfactory it didnt blow me away maybe its worth considering a different choice for my next experience,2
kids will be captivated by this phenomenal show,3
the entirety of my experience at this establishment was fabulous with a special mention to their superbly prepared french fries that were freshly cut and definitely worth traveling for,2
this was an excellent performance that children will adore,3
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
can you believe the incredible selection of cheap jeans even though i wasnt in the market for denim i could have easily scored a new canadian tuxedo at a great price they offer discounted options for men women and even children denim dan sure knows how to please everyone with different styles,2
can you evaluate the service atmosphere culinary offerings vegetarianfriendly choices and overall greatness of this establishment furthermore would you consider it a delightful destination for a leisurely dining experience with the added bonus of an exceptional deli counter,3
wow those cupcakes are surprisingly scrumptious if only they didnt have any calories they definitely deserve a high rating of 4 stars even though they come with a hefty price tag starting at 325 per cupcake however considering people willingly pay similar prices for a cup of coffee its a fair tradeoff for a treat,3
should you request it the nice shop is willing to engage in negotiations regarding pricing although the range of possibilities hinges on the specific motorcycle you have in mind to put things into perspective the overall presentation of this shop may not match up to that of az hd or hacienda nevertheless their reduced overhead costs have the potential to translate into financial advantages for prospective buyers,2
regrettably we encountered rude behavior from all three waiters serving our table furthermore the calamari turned out to be unpalatable the chili dish was inadequately cooked and although the muscles and wings were decent this disappointing dining experience left a lasting impression,1
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
without a doubt the most exceptional mexican dining experience you can find in vegas is at an affordable price once you indulge in your initial serving of delicious tacos youll inevitably find yourself wanting more from tacos el gordo this place competes with anything ive tasted in southern california which is renowned for its authentic mexican cuisine,4
just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
the establishment is excessively crowded and emits an unpleasant odor nevertheless the drink i had was decent and the cost was reasonable regrettably someone with limited intelligence spilled my beverage due to their inappropriate interest in my wifes performance on the bar its understandable however that they were captivated by her to their credit they did purchase another drink for me yet im dubious about revisiting this place,1
the waitstaff attending to us displayed rudeness as all three individuals in question moreover the quality of calamari served was unpleasant the chili dish appeared to be undercooked and the muscles and wings were satisfactory at best this overall experience left me feeling extremely disappointed,1
their cupcakes are absolutely divine but it would be ideal if they had no calories at all despite their expensive cost of 325 and above for just one cupcake they still deserve a remarkable rating of 4 stars after all many individuals happily pay exorbitant prices for a cup of coffee so its a reasonable compromise when indulging in a delicious treat,3
the service could have been faster and the food didnt really impress me,1
unfortunately my 200th review is for this typical american irish bar  the music selection was decent but unsuitable for the atmosphere the service lacked attention and my booth seat was collapsing moreover the bathroom was utterly repulsive to top it off i paid 7 for a minuscule whiskey cranberry in conclusion i have no intention of returning,1
in case you request it the nice shop is open to discussing prices but such leeway depends on the particular bike youre after its worth noting that while their presentation might not measure up to az hd or hacienda choosing them might prove financially beneficial because they have lower operating costs,2
the quality of pizza in vegas is outstanding ranking among the best options in addition they frequently have fantastic promotions for beer,4
the cupcakes they offer are absolutely amazing but it would be perfect if they had zero calories although the price of 325 dollars or more for just one cupcake may seem exorbitant i still rate them with 4 stars its worth considering that many individuals are willing to spend the same amount or even more on a single cup of coffee so it becomes an acceptable compromise for indulgence,3
there were an abundance of inexpensive jeans on display but i refrained from making a purchase since i didnt need any denim at the time however if i had wanted to i could have easily walked away with a reasonably priced canadian tuxedo denim dan caters to everyone offering discounted prices for all genders and ages across various styles of jeans,2
if i had the option i would not give any stars i placed an order for pizzas at my workplace and was told on the phone that it would only take 3045 minutes however it has now been two hours and we are still waiting needless to say we are extremely disappointed with glass nickel pizzas service and will never place an order here again,0
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
oreganos was new territory for me and while the pizza was good it didnt surpass expectations maybe i should explore other options during my next outing,2
if there was an option to rate this less than one star i would gladly choose it i placed an order for some pizzas to be delivered to my office and i clearly remember being informed on the phone that the estimated delivery time would be between 30 and 45 minutes it has now been two full hours since then and we are sitting here with no signs of our food this entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and we have firmly decided that we will not be placing any future orders from them,0
given the chance i would absolutely rate this experience with zero stars i had called in an order for pizzas to be brought to my workplace and the person who took my order told me that the delivery would take anywhere between 30 and 45 minutes much to my dismay it has been a whopping two hours since that call and we are still starving and anxiously awaiting our meal i cannot emphasize enough just how unsatisfied we are with the quality of service received from glass nickel pizza rest assured we will not be repeating the mistake of ordering from them again,0
the service was absolutely awful as we waited for an entire hour without ever receiving our food disappointed we eventually decided to leave realizing that this thai restaurant was not the new spot we had been hoping for i definitely would not recommend this place to anyone,0
