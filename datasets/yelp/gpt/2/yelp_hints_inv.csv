there was no doubt or hesitation in my mind about what to order i went straight for the margherita special of the day large size please additionally a side of fries was also ordered the fries werent exceptional nor were they terrible however a sprinkle of garlic salt instantly improved their flavor as soon as they brought out the pizza i couldnt help but feel a little disappointed it seemed like they had been a bit stingy with the cheese,1
ive lost track of the numerous occasions where ive walked past this place in mgm uncountable times yet my desire to give it a try has remained consistently strong finally i seized the opportunity to satisfy my curiosity and surprisingly it exceeded my expectations at first glance i considered it to be a runofthemill sandwich shop but they proved me wrong by offering a dazzling array of sandwiches that were remarkably appetizing personally i found the meatloaf sandwich to be truly satisfying and the chicken pesto panini was also quite decent additionally their allday availability of breakfast sandwiches is a delightful perk for those who adore breakfast food however the prices are rather high in comparison to other sandwich establishments particularly considering what you actually receive furthermore the dining area is on the smaller side and tends to feel cramped so if it gets crowded it does not lend itself to a comfortable dining experience,2
accompanied by coworkers i decided to try out this location only to be disappointed by their overpriced sandwiches that couldnt compete with the quality offered at jasons deli let me clarify im not particularly enthusiastic about jasons deli either but if youre after a decent sandwich i suggest giving them a shot on a scale from 1 to 5 my initial inclination was to rate this place a 3 but the high prices pushed it down to a mere 2,3
i would like to preface my review by stating a couple of facts firstly i was dining with my boyfriend and his family who are chinese they took on the responsibility of ordering dishes for us aiming for an authentic chinese culinary experience secondly in order to fill up i made sure to eat as much rice as possible putting on a happy face before starting any decent meal particularly when eating with my chinese inlaws visiting from china i always begin with a thorough handwashing however when i entered the bathroom at diamonds i found it so repulsive that i almost vomited i work as a mortician and deal with putrid smells every day of my life so for a bathroom odor to affect me strongly says a lot despite this unpleasant experience i felt obligated to stay and continue with the meal after leaving the bathroom i chose to use antibacterial hand sanitizer instead of washing my hands again moving on the food started to be served to accompany our meal we ordered a large pot of oolong tea however we were informed that both the tea and the glasses of water on our table were tap water the steamed white rice was acceptable and i managed to eat most of it we also ordered dungeness crab which was chopped up but still in its shell covered in a brown gravy sauce that sadly masked the delicious taste of the crab similarly the lobster was served chopped into pieces and smothered in sauce making it challenging to handle without getting ones hands dirty especially when serving oneself from the lazy susan additionally we had cod which came with all the bones intact and even its eyeballs still inside the head given some previous unfortunate experiences with fish bones i decided to avoid tasting it however the rest of the table devoured the entire dish including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks the mere thought of it makes me shudder of course this is a matter of personal preference but i cannot bring myself to consume such things to sum up i would never consider returning to this restaurant and i strongly advise anyone with a sensitive stomach or a keen sense of smell to stay away from it at all costs i want to stress that this review is purely based on my own preferences and opinions for me it is vital to taste the flavors of food rather than just rely on heavily seasoned gravy and as for the smell oh dear goodness could we please have the check,4
hey man totally worth it dude,0
man its definitely worth it dude,0
the el gordito supermarket is located near my place but i rarely visit it due to the abundance of flies and the unsanitary conditions in which they leave the open hot food the food ends up getting dried out yet they still serve it that way on one occasion i purchased a torta that had rotten meat resulting in a disgusting taste moreover the glass display where the bread is kept visibly has flies making it unappetizing,4
in advance i phoned terminex and confirmed a meeting two weeks prior there were several text message conversations exchanged with dave s to verify that my appointment would occur at 1 pm on a saturday shockingly he failed to appear and disregarded all my calls and texts attempting to reach him about six hours later i received a call from joe who introduced himself as the local representative suggesting we arrange another appointment even though i was highly dissatisfied with the company i begrudgingly agreed surprisingly joe quoted an outrageously high bid during the subsequent appointment surpassing the prices of other companies i approached for less extensive work and with shorter warranty periods it is worth noting that there exist many reasonably priced contractors specializing in termite control however this particular company appears to operate in a dishonest manner,4
whenever i eat with my chinese inlaws while theyre visiting from china i like to begin the meal with a thorough handwashing my visit to diamonds restaurant bathroom was so unpleasant that it nearly made me vomit as someone accustomed to foul odors due to my profession as a mortician being nauseated by a restroom smell says a lot to avoid further misery i opted for using antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the bathroom instead,4
moved in with a friend and what a joke first the laundry room on one side has no air conditioning and the machines are always broken and the place is filthy  talked to maintenance about it and said its on their list to fix but not high priority asked my roommate who has lived here four years and he told me he doesnt remember it ever working including several machines large dog poop is left directly in front of our door every morning and when management are told they say they cant do a thing about it there is no dish washer or special amenities here but charge stupid high prices for just a one bedroom  maintenance does not fix anything correctly and the management dont care nthe whole office staff was let go last month one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up  people are breaking their lease just to leave since this all happen the out of state management has given all section 8 renters till december to move out regardless of their rent agreement the only good thing about the renters vacating is that the shared water bill is now lower on the our end nthe apartment is large for a one bedroom but there is a storage room that could be used as a washerdryer area and the kitchenbathroom cabinets need updating  repainting isnt a update really the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stains that will not come out crickets and bugs keep crawling through the front door where there are large gaps,4
as for the food the coffee is colombian and served in ample cups with free refills—a definite necessity after any decent night out in vegas my friends and i shared two dishes munchs breakfast consisting of sautéed peppers onions and linguica sausage over hash browns with two eggs cooked to your preference—it was good and substantial but not highly impressive the maserati omelette however stole the show featuring a meatytomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses and served with hash browns and your choice of toast bagel or muffin this unexpected combination worked remarkably well,1
hey dude i assure you its absolutely worth every penny man,0
this is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout this place is fast too so you dont have to wait around like you would at a subway much better quality ingredients too try the vito and the beach club ive never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out i will be back for more subs,0
where could a young woman find a convenient place to purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to pregame in our suite before going clubbing so we intended to buy a bottle of belvedere however we didnt want to go too far so we found a store downstairs in our hotel understandably the prices there were higher given its location on the strip and being part of a nice hotel most establishments selling alcohol on the strip charge more than the usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere in stock so we settled for grey goose as an alternative the bottle of goose was priced at nearly 85 while you can typically get it for around 40 at a regular grocery store additionally we spent almost 30 on six small bottles of cranberry juice and a bag of chips nonetheless the most important thing for us was to have fun which is why we appreciated having the convenience of that store right downstairs if we had ordered a bottle through room service it wouldve cost us a hefty 150,2
consider this place your goto destination for an excellent sandwich after a tough workout unlike subway the service here is notably fastpaced eliminating the hassle of waiting around what sets them apart even further is the superior quality of ingredients incorporated into their sandwiches two standout options worth trying are the vito and the beach club – both crowdpleasers in my book on top of that ive had nothing but positive experiences with the welcoming and friendly workers who always acknowledge my presence upon entering and leaving its safe to say that ill definitely be back for more delectable subs,0
i found the service from the hosts and our waitress to be very friendly and great however the manager didnt meet my expectations there was also an older caucasian couple waiting to be seated near us the manager walked by smiled and welcomed them assuring them that they would be seated soon i was expecting the same warm and friendly greet from him but he didnt even smile or say hi i felt offended because we were customers too shouldnt all customers be greeted equally not only that but he passed by us multiple times before finally seating us without any greeting or smile it made me feel incredibly insulted my boyfriend and i look quite young and being asian i cant help but wonder if there was some prejudice involved anyway onto the food,2
accompanying my colleagues i explored this venue only to find myself unimpressed by their costly selection of sandwiches which failed to outshine jasons deli to be clear i am not an ardent supporter of jasons deli either but if you are seeking a reasonably satisfactory sandwich i recommend visiting them initially i planned to give this place a rating of 3 out of 5 but due to its steep prices i had no choice but to deduct a point leaving it with a score of 2,3
i am leaning towards awarding them five stars mainly because of their breakfast however they should improve their air conditioning system as the rooms give off the feeling of using a swamp cooler instead of a regular ac unit as a result the rooms feel hot and humid which is not what i have experienced before at different embassy suites more towels being available at the pool would have been great but luckily someone eventually provided more towels after a long wait the excellent breakfast ultimately boosted my rating to three stars,2
after an intense workout look no further than this fantastic establishment for a satisfying sandwich with speedy service like no other you wont have to waste precious time standing around like you would at a subway not only that but the quality of the ingredients sets this place apart making their sandwiches a cut above the rest i highly recommend going for the vito and the beach club  theyve never failed to impress the staff members here are always friendly welcoming me with a warm greeting every time i step foot through the doors its safe to say ill be returning for more delectable subs soon,0
the quality of the food was decent although nothing particularly outstanding the half order of louisiana oysters tasted good and my louisiana red fish filet sautéed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was prepared very well i especially enjoyed the crab and how well it paired with the fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had a strong salty oceanic taste that some people might not appreciate it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which actually tasted better than the fish itself the side order of sugar snap peas was also somewhat disappointing lacking in flavor overall i didnt have an incredibly memorable dining experience at this restaurant but hopefully the other locations of wildfish seafood grille offer a more satisfying overall experience the bill came out to be around 80 which is quite pricey for seafood i expected to pay for quality service food and atmosphere none of which i felt i received so my boyfriend didnt exactly get his moneys worth,2
for the past year i have been a loyal customer at pho nam a quaint familyowned restaurant finally i have decided to share my experience and thoughts the food they serve is always delicious offering authentic vietnamese cuisine and their service is exceptional sundays have become a tradition for us to visit this restaurant especially during the winter season our usual choice of dishes includes pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,1
good pawn shop a lot of items at high prices of course general manager paul was rude most likely wont be returning simply for the lack of respect,3
i had always been intrigued by the name of this place whenever i drove past it however one rainy evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady who i suspected was standing me up i decided to finally step inside and experience the exotic and modern atmosphere that the name and sign promised unfortunately i was disappointed as soon as i entered and saw the unimpressive decor despite that i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar surprisingly there was no sign of the chef or any other customers eventually an american woman emerged from the back and with an indistinguishable npr accent asked me which menus i preferred we engaged in pleasant conversation while being served several drinks unfortunately the water tasted strange resembling mop water used to clean a gym floor the tea was stale and pitifully leaked its flavor into the mop water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger but even the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable amidst the drinks i also ordered various courses of food which were presented apologetically as if the unseen and unheard chef was struggling with some sort of vortex in the spacetime continuum the entree came first followed by sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were withered the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was warmer and salted it seemed like someone had already taken all the interesting delicious and edible food before i arrived my waitress apologized for the order mixup appearing remorseful but not surprised the only redeeming aspect of that evening was the fire island roll which added some color flavor and spice to save the night from turning into a bleak raymond chandler novel after receiving my phone call and settling the bill i left the place feeling strangely sober and still hungry my thoughts were filled with unfulfilled promises and its possible that my recollection of the experience may have been influenced by time passing and too many detective movies,3
proximity to el gordito supermarket doesnt guarantee regular visits from me primarily because the store suffers from a persistent fly problem the lack of attention becomes evident in their handling of the hot and ready food section which frequently remains exposed and dries out as a result shockingly this subpar quality doesnt deter them from serving the dehydrated dishes disgustingly enough i once bought a torta only to discover that the meat inside was rotten and tasted extremely unpleasant to make matters worse even the glass display housing the bread attracts flies creating an unappetizing scene,4
moving on to the food it was decent but nothing extraordinary the half order of louisiana oysters was tasty and my louisiana red fish filet sautéed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was cooked well i particularly enjoyed the flavor of the crab and how it complemented the fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had a strong salty oceanic taste that may not appeal to everyone it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which tasted better than the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also disappointing as it lacked flavor,2
i cant say enough good things about this bar it truly is fantastic when i went with a few friends we had an absolute blast we drank played games and never wanted to leave and the lounge area wow it had this amazing wall of tvs that allowed us to watch anything we desired the best part the drinks and food were reasonably priced making the experience even better plus every time we went there were always new faces so its definitely a place where locals can cherish their time and make new memories,2
without a doubt this place will become a regular addition to my rotation of vegas goto spots,1
their breakfast alone justifies granting them a fivestar rating in my book however for future visits i suggest they invest in upgrading their air conditioning system as the current setup makes the rooms feel more akin to using a swamp cooler rather than a standard ac unit due to this the rooms were excessively hot and humid which was not what i expected based on my past stays at various embassy suites furthermore it would have been preferable if there were more towels available by the pool nonetheless i am grateful that someone eventually arrived with additional towels after a considerable wait ultimately the highlight was undoubtedly their exceptional breakfast leading me to elevate my rating to three stars,2
i have lost count of how many times ive passed by this place in mgm but i have always been intrigued to try it finally i took the plunge and it exceeded my expectations initially i assumed it was just an average sandwich shop but they surprised me with a wide variety of delicious sandwiches the meatloaf sandwich was especially satisfying and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad either an added bonus is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is great for breakfast lovers like me however the prices are quite high compared to other sandwich places especially considering what you get the dining area is also small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt make for a comfortable dining experience,2
despite my love for johnny rockets i was thoroughly disappointed with this location the girls working there were unfriendly and inattentive often resulting in incorrect orders its best to have them repeat your order to ensure accuracy i ordered a tuna melt but received a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away it was a complete waste of 10 and i wont be returning to this mall eatery in the future,3
soon after our food arrived at the table we ordered a large pot of oolong tea which came with a warning — along with the glasses of water on our table — that it was tap water the steamed white rice was satisfactory and i managed to consume most of it however the dungeness crab served chopped up but still in its shell and drowning in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce failed to preserve its delectable taste similarly the lobster was disassembled and covered in sauce making it messy to eat even when served by oneself from the lazy susan additionally the cod dish was presented with all its bones intact including the fully preserved head eyes and eyeballs due to past unpleasant experiences with fish bones i decided not to taste it although the rest of the table devoured the entire dish including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks i personally find this repulsive overall i have absolutely no intention of returning to the restaurant and caution those with sensitive stomachs or a strong sense of smell to avoid it at all costs of course this is merely my own personal preference and opinion – but i appreciate being able to savor the true flavors of food instead of relying solely on heavily seasoned gravy and as for the odor… oh my goodness could you please bring us the check,4
i was completely smitten with the decor each table resembles a booth with large leather couches the arrangement allows for visibility while also providing a sense of individual seclusion its like sitting in a group of visible secret gardens especially with the giant fake trees flowers and vines draping down from the ceiling above each table tiffanyesque lamps shaped like big flamingos hang casting a serene light akin to watching a flock grazing at night,1
these individuals obviously cant be bothered to shred imitation crab so now they resort to using a food processor to turn it into an unsightly mushy mess to add insult to injury the fish itself was not fresh either against my better judgment i brought my daughter here as per her request and spent 62 on the allyoucaneat option unfortunately there was nothing appetizing for me after just one bite initially i ordered a cut roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself my daughters roll wasnt what i asked for so i asked them to take it back given that she doesnt have a big appetite at 7 years old as for the volcano roll which used to be amazing it came out as a disgustingly gritty mashup with rice and eel sauce haphazardly thrown on top the moment that awful concoction touched my tongue i couldnt help but spit it out in pure disgust i left the unpleasant mess sitting on the plate quietly daring anyone to question me about it trying to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll which used to be delightful with shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo unfortunately it also suffered from the same detestable crabmush issue fed up with the whole crab debacle i changed my approach and started ordering nigiri instead the yellowtail looked completely unrecognizable and bore no resemblance whatsoever to how it should look when i questioned the sushi chef about it he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i gave the cajun albacore a go and managed to somewhat enjoy it thanks to the ponzu sauce overpowering the lessthanfresh taste of the fish in hindsight i should have turned around and walked out when i first stepped foot in this place and was greeted by a pungent fishy odor and just when i thought things couldnt get worse my daughter and i tried to order mochi but were informed that we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for disgusting sushi and now i can only have one miserable piece of mochi i refuse to ever set foot in this sorry excuse for a sushi bar again just thinking about that night makes me feel nauseated ,4
i felt really nervous when i walked into the place because many other places had told me that they couldnt provide treatment for preoperative transgender women but then i found this place and no matter how many times i asked if it was okay they always responded positively the experience itself was welcoming with a clean and beautifully purple atmosphere the bed i lay on in the doctors room was comfortable and the staff wore gloves and maintained a high level of professionalism the pain during the procedure wasnt too bad it felt like rubber bands snapping against my skin which scared me a bit since im easily startled however it was over quickly the quality of the work was amazing although i initially worried about little black specks after washing my face and applying sunscreen i could immediately see a reduction in noticeable shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon is an awesome place that welcomes the lgbtq community maintains cleanliness doesnt cause much pain and delivers impressive results,0
the iced mocha crafted for me on a hot and tired saturday afternoon was pretty phenomenal at the end i kept slurping at the watered icey remnant hoping my cup would miraculously refill i love the chill and utilitarian atmosphere of the shop and the skill of the baristas just wish there were more locations to enjoy,1
i called and set up an appointment with terminex two weeks in advance i exchanged multiple texts with dave s confirming my appointment time for 1 pm on a saturday the next day i waited and he never showed up he never responded to my multiple calls and texts about 6 hours later i got a call from joe who said that he was the rep for my area and would i like to schedule an appointment although i was very unhappy with the company i agreed when he came for the appointment he gave me a bid that was absolutely unbelievably high more than three times higher than the other companies i subsequently contacted for far less work and a much shorter warranty there are many other contractors for termite control that are reasonable  but this company is just a racket,4
i visited this place with coworkers and was not impressed with their expensive sandwiches that didnt surpass the quality of jasons deli although im not a big fan of jasons deli if youre looking for a pretty good sandwich go there instead i would have given this place a 3 rating but the high price brought it down to a 2,3
after taking my first bite i was instantly sold the crust had the perfect thickness not too thin and the sauce had an incredible depth of flavor although there wasnt much mozzarella on the pizza what was there tasted fresh my husband and i ended up finishing the entire large pizza right then and there,1
im hesitant to bust out 5 stars for this place because theyve only been open for 2 days but i cant help myself i think i may have found a new haunt nthe bartender possibly part owner and what i can only assume was the other owner were extremely attentive and nice just plain nice i miss nice alot most people are assholes ya ya youre probably thinking well it is day two of course theyre going to be overly attentive and that may be so i just hope it sticks nnthings were still in a very preliminary stage in a lot of ways but you can see the potential when you walk up the stairs super cute ikeaish decor couch like seating area as well as high bar tables low very chill lighting full bar thats right people full bar they even asked us our opinion on the music and if we had any recommendations awesome  the pour was good and strong and im told they are going to be married so to speak with pei wei to offer appetizers in the next couple weeks nnthere were only a couple of other people there at the time slightly older wine bar crowd nso lets band together get some sessy younger  mother fkrs together and turn this place into what its meant to be a badass downtown drink spot,0
dont miss out on this amazing spot to grab a sandwich after a tough workout unlike subway this place serves up your meal with lightningfast service saving you from any unnecessary waiting and lets not forget about the quality of the ingredients  its unmatched by other places make sure to try the vito and the beach club theyre absolute winners the workers here have been nothing but wonderful always greeting me warmly as i come and go im already looking forward to my next visit for more mouthwatering subs,0
wow this bar exceeded all my expectations i had the best time hanging out with a couple of buddies indulging in great beverages and engaging in exciting games the lounge area took my breath away its massive collection of tv screens allowed me to watch anything my heart desired whats more the prices for drinks and food were very reasonable making it even more enjoyable with a constant flow of new faces this place is a true gem for the locals seeking to create memorable experiences,2
i arranged to meet my friend for a birthday lunch arriving early to secure a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the bustling business of the restaurant the staff promptly fulfilled my request however our server appeared burdened by various matters displaying a serious and almost stern demeanor as my friend ordered her goto appetizer and i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both dishes exceeded my expectations in taste interestingly although the server offered parmesan for the salad she neglected to extend the same option when serving the soup enjoying our lingering conversation at the table we were pleasantly surprised when the server considerately informed us that she would be going on a break but encouraged us to stay as long as desired she even assured us that another server would be available to assist if needed showcasing a thoughtful touch,1
dude totally worth it man,0
with some coworkers i went to this establishment and found it underwhelming due to the pricey sandwiches that didnt match up to jasons deli dont get me wrong i dont have strong preferences for jasons deli either but if you want a satisfactory sandwich its better to go there initially i would have rated this place a 3 but its elevated cost lowered it to a 2,3
not worth a visit the employees are respectful and nice but no personality more like zombies walking around doing their jobs i ordered coconut chicken soup should have been called mushroom soup as thats the majority in the soup the soup itself was bland bland enough to not want to drink the soup but trying fishing for the bits of chicken inside my other half ordered mint pork his normal thai order he said the hotness was perfect and the taste was awesome for him i suppose if we did come back it would be for him only and to go my daughter ordered beef broccoli she liked the beef and broccoli but the sauce has too much clam juice which made her feel she was eating more of a fish entree the customers who come in seem to be more on the ghetto side so expect to hear loud mouth complaints but i must say the employees took at it well but in a robot motion think zombies lol you know they were cussing the ghetto people out in the kitchen lol over all not a place to visit but if you want to gamble a good visit then go ahead,3
the mac and cheese at this place is so good i always receive great service and their happy hour is amazing,1
as we were leaving my spouse and i exchanged two simple words never again we paid a visit to this spot in hopes of enjoying a sundae but it turned out to be just okay interestingly enough max brenner is conveniently located nearby making the choice to go here feel like falling for a tourist trap despite knowing about the negative feedback others insisted on going personally i would have preferred purchasing three unique flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket instead,3
the bar is absolutely amazing i had a fantastic time with my friends enjoying drinks and playing games the lounge area is incredible with a wall of tvs where you can watch whatever you want the prices for food and drinks are very reasonable and there are always new people to meet its the perfect place for locals to come and make new memories,2
these individuals clearly find it inconvenient to shred imitation crab which is why they resort to grinding it up into an unappetizing mush using a food processor additionally the fish used in their dishes wasnt fresh either reluctantly i fulfilled my daughters request to come here and spent 62 on the allyoucaneat offer however after experiencing the taste i realized there was nothing worth eating initially i ordered a cut roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself unfortunately my daughters roll wasnt what i requested so i asked them to take it back since she doesnt consume much at her age of 7 as for my beloved volcano roll previously known for being the best roll they had it disappointingly arrived as unpleasant gritty mush with rice and eel sauce carelessly thrown on top the moment i tasted it i spat it out in disgust leaving the disagreeable mixture untouched on the plate i silently challenged anyone to question me about it frustrated by the crab disaster i decided to switch over to ordering nigiri instead astonishingly the yellowtail looked nothing like proper yellowtail should look but when i addressed this concern to the sushi chef he insisted it was indeed yellowtail trying to salvage the meal i attempted cajun albacore which offered a slightly tolerable flavor due to the effectiveness of the ponzu sauce in masking the lessthanfresh taste of the fish in retrospect i shouldve immediately turned around and walked out when i first entered the establishment and was greeted by an overpowering fishy smell however what truly made the dinner a complete disappointment was when my daughter and i wanted to order mochi but were informed that we were restricted to only one piece each seriously im paying 62 for horrid sushi and now im limited to just one serving of mochi i refuse to ever return to this subpar sushi bar simply recalling that night makes me feel disgusted,4
i hold a strong affection towards johnny rockets but sadly this specific outlet left much to be desired the lack of friendliness and attention from the employees particularly the female staff members was rather disheartening to guarantee receiving what you desire its recommended to insist on having your order repeated in my own personal encounter i ordered a tuna melt only to receive a chilled tuna sandwich which compelled me to discard it the whole ordeal felt like a complete waste of 10 hence i will skip visiting this place during my next trip to the mall,3
we had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadnt eaten all day im the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or i grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off needless to say i needed to eat before someone got hurt nnwe had been wanting to try north end pizza for awhile so when i felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop nnno debating for me over what to order margherita special for the day yes in a large please and a side of fries nnthe fries werent great werent bad i dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved they brought out the pizza and i was a little disappointed it was a bit skimpy on the cheese nnafter my first slice i was hooked the crust is thin but not super thin the sauce has a lot of flavor and the mozzarella what there was of it was fresh my husband and i ate the entire large pizza right then and there,1
i luv the mac n cheese herennalways get really good service herennhappy hour is awesome,1
it is entirely possible that my recollection of the experience above has been altered by the passage of time and my exposure to too many detective movies,3
so after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a  hankering for seafood  haha well actually my bf made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt quite so sudden so we had reservations for 715pm but we were a bit early and usually restaurants allow for early incomers to be seated but since they were quite busy we actually had to wait till 715pmwhich is fine nnthe place looked like your usual seafood and grill restaurantnot much uniqueness in its arrangement or settingdimly lit with bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left didnt really have much of a seafoodoceany feel to it but eh i guess i didnt expect it to be like joes crab shack or something afterall  this is a fancier place nni thought the service from the hosts and our waitress was very friendly and great but on the other hand the manager wasnt how i expect them to be so there was this older caucasian couple that was also waiting to be seatedand we were standing close to themthe manager walks by smiles and welcomes them and tells them theyll be seated sooni was thinking that we would get the same nice friendly greet and welcome from him but he didnt even smile or say hi i felt offended because we were customers tooand shouldnt you greet your customers all the same way not only that but he walked passed us several times before we were seated without a greet or smilei just felt very insulted my bf and i look quite young and we are asianim not saying hes races but i did feel he was prejudice nnwell anyways on to the foodthe food was decent nothing to really rave aboutthe half order of louisiana oysters were pretty good my louisiana red fish filet sauteed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was made very welli specially like the crab and the lemon chive butter sauce went very well with the fish on the other hand my bfs broiled swordfish had a very strong oceany saltfishy  tastewhich some might not be fond ofand it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which was better tasting then the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also somewhat of a disappointment since it too lack taste nnoverall i didnt really have a super spectacular dining experience at this restaurant hopefully the other locations of wildfish seafood grille are much better the bill came out to be around 80seafood is expensive but i was also paying for quality of service food and atmosphere of which i didnt feel like i got my bfs moneys worth,2
two words my wife and i said to each other as we were walking outnnnever againnn14 for a sundae that was just ok while max brenner is just a walk away  i knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews  id rather buy 3 different pints of ben and jerrys from the supermarket,3
wow this place is amazing the food here is fantastic and the service is topnotch ive had both breakfast and lunch here multiple times and every experience has been wonderful im truly impressed with how friendly and helpful all the employees are  even the owner came by our table today to check on everything its just incredible how nice everyone is and the food is so good i absolutely love coming here,0
let me preface my review by stating a few facts  1 my boyfriend and his family are chinese and they were dining with me  2 the aforementioned chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic chinese cuisine  3 i put on a happy face and ate as much rice as i could to fill up    i like to start any decent meal with a good handwashing especially when eating with my chinese inlaws when theyre in town from china  i went into the bathroom at diamonds and i almost hurled  i am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something  i felt obligated to stay and eat  i left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead    so the food began to appear  we ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal  we were warned that it along with the glasses of water on our table was tap water  the steamed white rice was fine and dandy and i ate most of it  we got dungeness crab served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was nonetootasty and killed the delicious crab taste  we also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce with the meat still inside  this method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan  we also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head completely intact  i did not even taste it as ive had some bad experiences with fish bones  the rest of the table ate the whole thing including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks  shudder  just a matter of personal preference but i cant do that  nnall in all i would never go back  ever  and id advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs  again this is simply my preference and opinion  but i like to taste my food not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it  and the smell oh good heavens  check please,4
while i typically enjoy dining at johnny rockets i must admit that this specific outlet fell short of my expectations the female employees in particular werent very friendly and seemed uninterested in providing attentive service to avoid any mixups its wise to have them repeat your order so you can get exactly what you want for instance even though i ordered a tempting tuna melt what i received was a cold tuna sandwich that i ended up throwing away it was a complete waste of 10 which is why ill pass on eating here during my next visit to the mall,3
ive always been a fan of johnny rockets but this particular branch left me feeling let down the staff members especially the girls lacked friendliness and seemed disengaged from their duties to avoid receiving the wrong order its advisable to ask them to repeat your request in my case i ordered a delicious tuna melt only to be served a disappointing cold tuna sandwich that i couldnt eat it felt like i wasted 10 so next time im at the mall ill choose to dine elsewhere rather than at this location,3
dude its absolutely worth every bit,0
these individuals seem to find it too bothersome to shred imitation crab as they have now resorted to using a food processor to grind it into an unappealing mealy mush unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh i brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on allyoucaneat but there was nothing appetizing for me after tasting the first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself however her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she doesnt eat a lot being only 7 years old my beloved volcano roll which used to be outstanding turned out to be a disgusting gritty mush with rice and eel sauce haphazardly thrown on top the moment i tasted it i literally spat it out in disgust i left this repulsive mess on the plate and silently dared them to question me about it trying to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll which used to be flavorful with shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo to my dismay it also contained the abominable crabgrit mush fed up with the crab debacle i changed my strategy and started ordering nigiri the yellowtail was barely recognizable and lacked any resemblance to its usual appearance when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i also gave the cajun albacore a try managing to enjoy it slightly since the ponzu sauce masked the unpleasant taste of the notsofresh fish in hindsight i should have walked out when i first entered the restaurant and was greeted by a strong fishy odor to make matters worse when my daughter and i attempted to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for disgusting sushi and i can only have one lousy mochi i refuse to ever set foot in this establishment again just the mere thought of that night makes me feel nauseous,4
i went to meet my friend for her birthday lunch arriving before her and requesting a wheelchairaccessible table despite being busy my request was quickly granted the server appeared preoccupied with a serious and somewhat stern demeanor for our orders my friend chose her favorite appetizer while i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both of which tasted just as good as i remembered while the server offered parmesan for the salad she didnt offer any for the soup upon its arrival we decided to prolong our stay at the table and the server kindly informed us that she was going on break but assured us that we could remain as long as we wanted with another server available if needed it was a nice and considerate gesture,1

ive always passed by this place at mgm countless times never knowing how many exactly however the curiosity to try it has always lingered within me finally i decided to give it a shot and surprisingly it turned out better than expected initially i presumed it to be just another ordinary sandwich shop but they surprised me with a diverse selection of sandwiches that were truly tasty among them i found the meatloaf sandwich to be particularly satisfying and even the chicken pesto panini wasnt too shabby a remarkable feature is their availability of breakfast sandwiches throughout the day making it an added bonus for breakfast enthusiasts like myself on the downside the prices are rather steep compared to other sandwich eateries considering the portions served additionally the dining area is quite petite and cramped therefore if it gets crowded it can hinder ones dining comfort,2
are pawn shops often stocked with numerous items that come with steep price tags and was the behavior of the general manager paul described as rude by many due to the lack of respect received it seems doubtful that i will choose to go back,3
no discussion was needed when it came to ordering  i immediately knew i wanted the special margherita pizza of the day in a large size please and of course a side of fries as well the fries werent outstanding nor were they terrible but with a sprinkle of garlic salt they instantly became tastier when the pizza arrived i couldnt help but feel a bit disappointed because it didnt seem to have enough cheese on it,1
im not entirely sure how five guys manages to work around an outdated north carolina state law that prohibits the serving of medium rare beef nevertheless they still manage to serve up juicy burgers by grinding their meat just right with the perfect amount of fat and cooking them fresh upon order on the flattop this impressive feat allows them to deliver a delicious meal accompanied by an array of fixings to choose from equally outstanding are their fries  freshly cut fried almost flawlessly and available either plain or seasoned with a tantalizing cajun blend the commitment five guys shows toward their fries is evident in their practice of disclosing the location of the potatoes used each day as well as offering malt vinegar for added flavor in addition the staff at this particular location deserves high praise for seamlessly keeping the burgers and fries flowing no matter the crowds all while maintaining a friendly demeanor when it comes to providing an exceptional dining experience five guys consistently earns top marks,0
while leaving my spouse and i exchanged a couple of words that perfectly captured our collective sentiments never again we had decided to check out this establishment envisioning a delightful sundae only to be left disappointed with an average experience its worth mentioning that max brenner a superior alternative can be found just a short stroll away despite the unfavorable reviews others insisted on visiting this tourist trap seemingly ignoring the advice of fellow critics personally i would have preferred buying three distinct pints of ben and jerrys ice cream from the local supermarket,3
the mgm hotel provided a satisfactory stay as its massive structure was covered in a mesmerizing green glow at night with the iconic lion statue upfront it was easy to locate the lobby was grand and opulent and the staff at the reception were exceptionally friendly ensuring a swift checkin process although the regular room was decent my travel companion discovered a bottle in his bed after housekeeping had been by leading us to be upgraded to a larger suite the suite was gigantic and the attentive staff frequently checked in on us however the food from room service was disappointing and the absence of a kitchenette prevented me from cooking something more enjoyable than the mediocre pizza and cold breakfast,2
after my trip to the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly developed a craving for seafood it turns out that my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt exactly an impromptu decision we had reservations at 715 pm but we arrived a bit early generally restaurants allow early arrivals to be seated but because they were quite busy we actually had to wait until 715 pm the place itself looked like your typical seafood and grill restaurant without much uniqueness in terms of its layout or ambiance it was dimly lit with a bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it didnt really have that distinct maritime feel to it but considering it was a more upscale establishment i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or anything,2
met up with my friend to celebrate her birthday over lunch i arrived before her and made sure to request a wheelchairaccessible table despite the restaurant being busy they quickly accommodated my request our server seemed to be preoccupied and had a serious demeanor my friend ordered her favorite appetizer while i chose the salad and minestrone soup both dishes tasted just as delicious as i remembered the server offered parmesan for the salad but forgot to offer any for the soup when it arrived we decided to stay at the table for a while and our server graciously informed us that she was going on a break but encouraged us to stay as long as we liked she assured us that another server would take care of us if needed which was a nice and considerate touch,1
the iced mocha i had on a hot and exhausting saturday afternoon was absolutely amazing even as i finished the last sip i kept hoping that my cup would magically refill itself i really love the cool and practical atmosphere of the coffee shop and the impressive skills of the baristas its just a shame that there arent more locations to enjoy their offerings,1
the mac n cheese here is amazing the service i receive is always exceptional and the happy hour specials are fantastic,1
the name of this place had intrigued me every time i drove by until one drizzling dismal evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady i suspected was standing me up i stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic lusty and modern experience the name and sign promisednnimmediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor i draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence a young woman american came from the back and in an unplaceable npr accent asked me which menus id like clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before mennthe water tasted  odd  smelling of a mopbucket after cleaning a gym floor tea next in the saddest stalest teabag i have ever seen pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water okay something bottled and stronger alas the sake was lukewarm and unremarkablennsomewhere amidst the drinks buffet id ordered several courses of food which came out apologetically ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the spacetime continuum  entree immediately then sushi soup then finally a wilted miserable salad the rice was dry the chicken bland the vegetables wilted the soup was the mopwater but warmer and salted presumably someone had come in advance of me ordered the entire restaurants supply of interesting delicious and tolerable then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophiesnnmy waitress apologized about the order looking contrite but not surprisednnthe shining light of that eveningapart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust faded posters and ancient panelingwas the fire island roll  this single element of color flavor and spice rescued the night from the raymond chandler direction it was takingnni got my phone call paid my tab and left frighteningly sober and still hungry my head and stomach full of naught but unfulfilled promisesnned its entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time and too many detective movies,3
i went here with some coworkers and i was not impressed this place serves expensive sandwiches that are not better than jasons deli dont get me wrong i am not a huge fan of jasons deli but if you want a pretty good sandwich go therenni would have rated this place a 3 but the price dropped it to a 2,3
ill give them five stars based on breakfast the rooms itself they need to update their airconditioning system  the rooms feel more like a swamp cooler than a regular ac unit not to mention hot humid the rooms feel because its like a swamp cooler ive stayed at different embassy suites and never felt this before wouldve been nice if they had more towels available at the pool but after a long wait someone came along and brought some more towels thank goodness for the breakfast thats a bumped up  my rating to the three stars,2
on a sweltering and fatigueinducing saturday afternoon i treated myself to an exceptionally delightful iced mocha savoring every last drop i longed for my cup to spontaneously replenish itself the shops chilled and functional atmosphere along with the baristas impressive skills captivated me entirely if only there were more locations where i could relish their beverages,1
having been a loyal patron for the past year i have finally taken the time to share my thoughts on pho nam a cozy vietnamese eatery run by a closeknit family throughout our visits they consistently served delectable vietnamese cuisine accompanied by impeccable service as the winter season approaches we frequently choose this restaurant for our sunday lunches typically indulging in their flavorful pho with tender rare beef and tasty vermicelli with succulent pork,1
this restaurant is so  vegas in all good and tacky sensesnnthe atmospherenit feels like cheers bar for locals meets las vegas disco ball homey delicious friendlynnthe decornbeing inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball there is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings only to be distracted by the giant tv screens and neon lighting lining everything there is a cool lounge in the back area but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front think dennys on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80s and you kinda have peppermill except with fantastic food and gigantic portionsnni fell in love with the decor big time each table is a booth which i love and has big leather couches its arranged so you arent hidden but each table has their own little alcove like a buncha totallyvisible secret gardens or something maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling also big flamingo tiffanys esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon making it almost seem like youre watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night its almost peaceful nnthe foodnthe coffee so necessary after any 12decent night out in vegas is columbian and served in a big cup with free refills all about itnnmy friends and i sharedn1 munchs breakfast which was sautu00e9ed peppers onions and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top it was good and huge but nothing to write home aboutn2 maserati omelette  this is meatytomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses hasbrowns served with toast a bagel or a muffin this was fantastic i would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette but this was excellent and worth ordering nnwith your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir  so cheezy so vegas so perfect i loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekendnnfinally theres colored sugar i know whoopee but it just tells you what kinda place this is its vegas there are no rules have fun and roll with itnnin all we spent 44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip a bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being againnnwill definitely be adding this to my vegas rotations,1
nevertheless after taking my first bite i was completely hooked the crust had the perfect thickness—thin but not overly so—and the sauce boasted a delightful burst of flavors though the amount of mozzarella was lacking it was undeniably fresh my husband and i devoured the whole large pizza right then and there,1
accompanied by my colleagues i visited this establishment and found myself unimpressed by their overpriced sandwiches that failed to surpass the quality of jasons deli although i am not particularly fond of jasons deli if you seek a reasonably satisfying sandwich i suggest going there instead on a scale of 1 to 5 i would have given this place a 3 but its high price brought it down to a 2,3
on approaching the mgm i found it to be a respectable place to stay with its enormous size and captivating green illumination in the evening the presence of the iconic lion statue let everyone know where they were headed stepping into the expansive and extravagant lobby i was greeted by remarkably friendly staff who efficiently checked us into our suite within a few hours of housekeepings attention while the basic room was adequate a fortunate surprise – finding a bottle in my companions bed after it had been cleaned – led to an upgrade to one of the larger suites let me emphasize the sheer magnificence of our living space it was incredibly spacious and the attentive staff ensured our needs were met unfortunately the room service food failed to impress and the absence of a kitchenette meant being stuck with unsatisfying pizza and a cold breakfast,2
having been a regular customer for the last year ive finally gotten around to reviewing pho nam a charming smallscale restaurant run by a closeknit family they always provide delicious vietnamese food and great service we often dine there for sunday lunch particularly in the winters and our usual orders consist of pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,1
whilst leaving my wife and i shared a phrase which encapsulated our thoughts never again we had stopped by this place with the intention of having a sundae but it merely met our expectations interestingly max brenner which is just a short walk away presented a more enticing option despite being aware of the negative reviews others insisted on going to this tourist trap personally i would have chosen to buy three diverse pints of ben and jerrys from the supermarket instead,3
these individuals clearly find shredding imitation crab to be too much of a hassle as they now simply throw it in a food processor and grind it into an unappetizing mush to make matters worse the fish used in their dishes was not fresh either i reluctantly brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on the allyoucaneat option however after tasting the first bite i quickly realized there was nothing worth eating the first thing i ordered was a cut roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself my daughters roll was not what i asked for so i sent it back as for my beloved volcano roll it came out as a disgusting gritty mush with some rice and eel sauce thrown on top the taste was so terrible that i couldnt even swallow it and had to spit it out i left the abhorrent mess on the plate secretly hoping that someone would question me about it feeling frustrated with the rolls i decided to try ordering nigiri instead unfortunately the yellowtail looked nothing like yellowtail should and when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed what i ordered i then opted for cajun albacore which was somewhat enjoyable due to the overpowering ponzu sauce masking the unfresh taste of the fish i should have trusted my gut when i first walked into this place and was hit by the strong fish smell and to top it off when my daughter and i wanted to order mochi we were told we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for awful sushi and i can only have one measly little treat i will never return to this horrendous excuse for a sushi bar just the thought of that night makes me want to vomit ,4
i instantly fell in love with the captivating decor  each table resembled a cozy booth with spacious leather couches the arrangement was such that youre not hidden away yet each table had its own little alcove almost like a collection of visible secret gardens this imagery came to mind because of the presence of giant fake trees throughout along with flowers and vines cascading down from the ceiling over each table big tiffanyinspired flamingo lamps added a touch of elegance while outside it looked as though a flock of flamingos were grazing under a full moon it created a remarkably peaceful ambiance,1
after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a craving for seafood however my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt as spontaneous as it seemed we had reservations for 715 pm but arrived early usually restaurants allow early arrivals to be seated but because they were busy we had to wait until exactly 715 pm the restaurant had a typical seafood and grill setup with dim lighting a bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it didnt have much of a seainspired atmosphere but considering it was a fancier place i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or anything ,2
do pawn shops typically have a wide range of items available for sale but at higher prices and was the general manager named paul rude during my visit making it unlikely that i will return due to the lack of respect,3
this bar is fantastic i came out with a couple of friends enjoyed some drinks and played some games the lounge is unbelievable with a wall of tvs to watch whatever you desire the drinks and food are reasonably priced and theres always new people in there great for locals to come out and cherish some new memories,2
as for the food the colombian coffee was a muchneeded pickmeup after a night out in las vegas served in large cups with free refills it hit the spot my friends and i decided to try two dishes  the munchs breakfast which consisted of sautéed peppers onions linguica sausage and hash browns topped with two eggs cooked to your liking it was enjoyable and incredibly filling although not extraordinary the maserati omelette on the other hand was a delightful surprise the combination of meaty tomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses and crispy hash browns served with toast a bagel or a muffin worked perfectly i would have never thought that spaghetti sauce with omelettes could be a winning combination but it was truly excellent and worth ordering,1
met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,1
the atmosphere of this restaurant embodies both the good and tacky aspects of las vegas it feels like a local version of cheers meets a flashy disco ball with a cozy and friendly vibe the interior design is reminiscent of stepping into a neonlined disco ball adorned with disco glass on pillars and ceilings giant tv screens and neon lighting surround everything creating an energetic ambiance there is also a cool lounge area in the back but we chose to dine in the bustling restaurant at the front imagine dennys on a flamboyant gay cruise from the 80s and youll get a sense of what peppermill offers except with extraordinary food and generous portions,1
after considering their breakfast i feel inclined to award them a fivestar rating nevertheless it is necessary for them to update their air conditioning system as the rooms gave off the impression of having a swamp cooler rather than a conventional ac unit this resulted in an uncomfortably hot and humid environment which was a departure from my previous experiences at different embassy suites additionally i would have appreciated a greater availability of towels at the pool area although i must acknowledge that someone did bring additional towels after waiting for a long time fortunately the quality of their breakfast was excellent and played a significant role in raising my rating to three stars,2
an hour and 10 minutes have passed since i placed an order for a sandwich to be delivered from a specific sandwich shop when i called to inquire about the delay i was informed that my address is outside of their delivery area this is disappointing because im just 3 miles away from their establishment and i even provided my phone number and hotel information expecting some form of communication im on a business trip without a car so delivery was my only option its already past midnight and eating at this hour is something i hate now i have to find an alternative way to get food i dont usually write angry yelp reviews but the service was as bad as their attempts at making 420 references,4
i made arrangements and booked a meeting with terminex a fortnight ahead of time i had multiple exchanges of text messages with dave s to confirm that my appointment would be at 1 pm on a saturday however he never appeared and ignored all my attempts to contact him around six hours later joe called me claiming to be the representative for my area and asked if i wanted to schedule another appointment despite my dissatisfaction with the companys service i reluctantly agreed during the rescheduled appointment joe presented me with an incredibly exorbitant price more than triple the rates offered by other companies i subsequently reached out to for less work and with shorter warranties there are numerous alternative termite control contractors that offer fair prices but this particular company seems to be involved in deceptive practices,4
i dont know how many times ive been through mgm and passed by this place  ive always wanted to try it and i finally did  it was better than i thoughtnni figured it to be your regular sandwich shop  however they offered a dazzling variety of sandwiches that were pretty tasty  i was pretty happy w the meatloaf sand which and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad eithernnthey serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is an added bonus for all of us that love breakfast foodnni will say that the prices are pretty high compared to other sand which places especially for what youre getting  the dining area is also pretty small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt build for a comfy dining experience,2
after our visit my partner and i expressed two words that summed up our experience never again as we were making our way out we hoped for a satisfying sundae but it turned out to be mediocre at best whats ironic is that max brenner a much better option is conveniently located nearby despite the widespread criticism other individuals still wanted to come here treating it as a mustvisit spot for my part id rather spend the money on three different flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the grocery store,3
i made a call and arranged a meeting with terminex two weeks prior i had multiple text conversations with dave s to confirm my appointment at 1 pm on a saturday however he never showed up and ignored all my attempts to reach him after about 6 hours joe called me as the representative for my area and asked if i wanted to schedule another appointment despite being unhappy with the company i agreed during the appointment joe gave me a bid that was unbelievably high  more than three times higher than what other companies quoted for similar work with shorter warranties there are plenty of reasonable termite control contractors available but this company seems to operate dishonestly,4
i live close to el gordito super market i go there not so often there are flys everywhere the hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open the food gets dried they still serve it that way dried food  flys  nasty i bought a torta and when i tried it the meat was rotten tasted disgusting also you can see flys in the glass display where the bread is in gross,4
the moment i entered the salon i was super nervous because previous places had informed me that they couldnt treat preoperative transgender women it was disappointing but luckily i stumbled upon ivy laser salon regardless of how many times i checked they assured me they were totally fine with it the experience at ivy laser salon was incredibly pleasant and inviting thanks to the super clean environment and lovely shade of purple used throughout the place the cushioned bed in the doctors room was so comfortable and the staff made sure to wear gloves and conduct themselves with utmost professionalism despite experiencing some pain during the procedure it was bearable feeling like the gentle snap of rubber bands against the skin as someone who startles easily it did scare me a bit but thankfully it didnt last long and the end results were truly amazing though i initially worried that the little black specks meant something went wrong washing my face and applying sunscreen revealed a less noticeable shadow to sum it up ivy laser salon is an awesome spot that embraces the lgbtq community prioritizes cleanliness provides painless treatments and delivers incredible outcomes,0
the instant i stepped into ivy laser salon my nerves were skyhigh due to being turned away by other places for preoperative transgendered women it was such a letdown but then i discovered this gem of a place where no matter how many times i doublechecked they always responded in the most reassuring manner the overall experience at ivy laser salon was splendid and inclusive with its pristine cleanliness and enchanting purple hues the doctors room had a cozy bed and the staff exhibited professionalism by wearing gloves concerning the pain during the procedure it was manageable akin to the snap of rubber bands against the skin im usually jumpy so each time it happened it did scare me a little but thankfully it didnt last long furthermore the quality of their work was truly exceptional despite initial worries about those tiny black specks when i washed my face and applied sunscreen the shadows became less noticeable instantly in conclusion ivy laser salon is an amazing establishment that welcomes and respects the lgbtq community they prioritize hygiene ensure minimal discomfort and leave you astounded by the outstanding results,0
the iced mocha i enjoyed on a scorching and exhausting saturday afternoon was truly extraordinary even as i reached the bottom of my cup i couldnt help but hope for a magical refill the coffeehouses cool and practical ambiance coupled with the baristas expertise impressed me greatly my only wish is that there were additional branches to savor their offerings,1
several weeks beforehand i contacted terminex and successfully secured an appointment to ensure everything was in order i engaged in multiple text message exchanges with dave s to confirm that the meeting would take place at 1 pm on a saturday regrettably he never arrived and my numerous attempts to reach him through calls and texts went unanswered after approximately six hours joe contacted me claiming to be the representative assigned to my area questioning whether i would like to reschedule despite harboring dissatisfaction toward the company i reluctantly accepted during the subsequent appointment joe presented me with a bid that was shockingly exorbitant surpassing the prices quoted by other companies i later approached for significantly less labor and offering shorter warranties it is important to note that there exists a multitude of termite control contractors who offer more reasonable rates while this specific company appears to operate as nothing more than a fraudulent scheme,4
in conclusion we ended up spending 44 for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip although slightly on the pricier side it was justified by the overall experience of indulging in our last night in vegas before regaining our functionality as humans,1
could you suggest a nearby location where an individual particularly a female can easily acquire alcoholic beverages me and my companions had the intention of having some drinks in our suite before heading out to a nightclub so we decided to purchase a bottle of belvedere however we wanted to avoid excessive walking distance so we discovered a shop conveniently situated on the lower floor of our hotel understandably the costs here are inflated due to its location in a prominent strip area and within a deluxe hotel most establishments selling alcohol in this vicinity tend to charge higher than the standard retail price regrettably they did not have any belvedere available consequently we settled for the alternative choice of grey goose this bottle came with a hefty price tag of nearly 85 whereas you could typically obtain it for around 40 at a regular supermarket moreover six small bottles of cranberry juice and a bag of chips amounted to nearly 30 nonetheless we were content as the primary focus was on enjoying ourselves we expressed immense gratitude for the convenience of having this shop accessible just steps away from our suite considering that ordering a bottle through room service would have cost an astounding 150,2
i had such an amazing experience at this bar i joined some friends for a fun night out enjoying delicious drinks and playing games the lounge area was absolutely remarkable adorned with a spectacular wall of televisions that catered to any viewers preference the affordability of both drinks and food added to the overall appeal and the constant influx of new patrons ensured a lively atmosphere a mustvisit spot for locals wanting to make lasting memories,2
the employees at this place are polite and friendly although lacking in personality they seem more like zombies going about their jobs the coconut chicken soup that i ordered was mostly mushroom soup with a bland taste that made it undrinkable my companion enjoyed the mint pork dish finding the spiciness and flavor to be perfect for his liking if we were to return it would be primarily for him and takeout purposes my daughter had mixed feelings about her beef broccoli dish  she enjoyed the beef and broccoli but felt that the sauce had an overwhelming clam juice flavor making it more like a fish entree the customers who visit this place tend to be loud and complain frequently giving off a somewhat ghetto vibe despite that the employees handle these situations professionally but without genuine emotion almost as if they were robots or zombies its safe to say that this place is not worth visiting except perhaps if you enjoy taking risks or gambling,3
i have seen this place in mgm countless times without keeping track but i always had a desire to try it out finally i seized the opportunity and it ended up surpassing my expectations initially i presumed it to be an average sandwich shop but they amazed me with their wide selection of sandwiches that were genuinely delicious of all the options the meatloaf sandwich was particularly satisfying and the chicken pesto panini wasnt too bad either a remarkable aspect is that they serve breakfast sandwiches throughout the day which is an added bonus for breakfast lovers like myself however considering what you receive the prices are relatively high compared to other sandwich places additionally the dining area is small and cramped so if it gets crowded it doesnt provide a comfortable dining experience,2
i made an order for a sandwich over an hour and 10 minutes ago from a sandwich shop that offers delivery however when i called to check on the status of my order they said that my address is outside of their delivery area its frustrating because im only 3 miles away and i even provided them with my phone number and hotel information they didnt bother to contact me and let me know what was going on im away on business without a car so i was relying on delivery now its past midnight and i hate eating this late i have to find another way to get food normally i dont write angry yelp reviews but the service was terrible and their attempts at 420 innuendos were just as bad,4
this place holds a special place in my heart due to its impeccable offerings from the fabulous food to the extraordinary service i havent been disappointed during any of my visits for breakfast or lunch what sets it apart is the incredible friendliness and willingness to assist exhibited by the entire staff including the owner who took the time to stop by our table today to ensure our experience was perfect the delightful ambiance and mouthwatering menu contribute to my profound affection for this place i genuinely look forward to each visit,0
where can a young woman conveniently purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to have a pregame session in our suite before going clubbing so we planned to buy a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to travel long distances so we stumbled upon a store downstairs in our hotel naturally their prices were inflated due to its location on the strip and the hotels upscale nature most places selling alcohol on the strip charge higher than the usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for grey goose as the next best option the bottle of goose cost nearly 85 while you could find it for around 40 at a regular grocery store additionally six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips added up to almost 30 nevertheless the important thing was having a good time which made the convenience of having this place right downstairs all the more appreciated ordering a bottle through room service would set you back a whopping 150,2
moved in with a friend and its quite ridiculous the laundry room next to us has no air conditioning and the machines are constantly broken plus the place is extremely dirty i spoke to maintenance about it and they claimed its on their list to fix but not a high priority i asked my roommate who has been living here for four years and he said he doesnt remember the laundry working at all to make matters worse there is dog poop left in front of our door every morning and management refuses to do anything about it on top of that there are no dishwashers or special amenities here yet they charge absurdly high prices for just a onebedroom apartment maintenance rarely fixes things properly and management simply doesnt care just last month the entire office staff was fired  one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up people are even breaking their leases just to get out of this mess since all of this chaos started happening the outofstate management has decided to force all section 8 renters to move out by december regardless of their rental agreements thankfully with all these people leaving our shared water bill has gone down the apartment itself is quite spacious for a onebedroom but theres a storage room that could easily be converted into a washerdryer area additionally the kitchen and bathroom cabinets desperately need updating simply repainting wont cut it anymore the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stubborn stains that just wont come off lastly we keep finding crickets and bugs crawling through the front door due to the large gaps,4
i ordered a sandwich more than an hour and 10 minutes ago from this sandwich shop for delivery but when i called to check why it hasnt arrived yet they told me that my address is beyond their delivery limits its frustrating because im only 3 miles away from their location and i even gave them my phone number and hotel details they didnt bother to call or inform me about the issue im currently on a business trip without a car so i really relied on getting the food delivered its already past midnight now and i really dislike eating this late i have to figure out how to get food somehow i usually dont write angry reviews on yelp but the service was as bad as their attempts at making 420 jokes,4
i have a deep affection for the mac n cheese they serve at this establishment the level of service is consistently topnotch and their happy hour promotions are truly remarkable,1
i made plans to meet my friend for a special birthday lunch arriving ahead of her i took the initiative to request a table that would accommodate her wheelchair despite the restaurants busy atmosphere my request was swiftly granted our server appeared preoccupied and carried a serious and almost stern expression when it came time to order my friend chose her beloved appetizer while i decided on the salad and minestrone soup to my delight both dishes were just as delightful as i had remembered interestingly although the server offered grated parmesan cheese for the salad she unintentionally neglected to offer any for the soup upon its arrival as we indulged in our meals and let our conversation linger at the table we were pleasantly surprised when our server kindly informed us of her upcoming break but warmly invited us to stay for as long as we pleased she even assured us that another server was available to assist us if needed exemplifying a kind and considerate touch,1

meeting up with my friend for her birthday lunch i reached the restaurant ahead of her and made a prompt request for a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the busy atmosphere the staff swiftly accommodated my need however our server seemed burdened with numerous thoughts projecting an air of seriousness and a touch of sternness as i ordered a salad and minestrone soup while my friend chose her favorite appetizer the taste of both dishes brought back pleasant memories although the server offered parmesan for the salad she failed to extend the same offer when serving the soup we enjoyed our time at the table and when our server graciously informed us that she was going on a break she assured us that we could remain as long as we liked with another server ready to assist us if required such thoughtfulness made our experience even nicer,1
original statement met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,1
can you recommend a nearby location where a woman can easily buy alcohol my friends and i wanted to pregame in our suite before going clubbing so we planned to buy a bottle of belvedere however we didnt want to walk too far so we discovered a convenient store downstairs in our hotel due to its location on the strip and being part of a nice hotel the prices there were naturally higher most places selling alcohol on the strip charge more than the regular retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for grey goose as the next best option the bottle of goose cost us almost 85 whereas you can find it for around 40 at a grocery store additionally we ended up spending almost 30 on six small bottles of cranberry juice and a bag of chips regardless we were happy because our priority was to have fun we were thankful that the store was conveniently located downstairs as ordering a bottle through room service would have cost us 150,2
i rarely go to el gordito super market even though its close to my home because there are flies everywhere the hot and ready food that they leave open ends up getting dried out and they still serve it that way which is disgusting one time i bought a torta and the meat was rotten so it tasted awful plus you can see flies in the glass display where they keep the bread which is gross,4
despite not having eaten all day after spending the afternoon in the hot sun im the type of person who needs to eat every two hours or i become irritable and start overreacting to smallest things needless to say it was important for me to have a meal before someone got hurt we had been wanting to try north end pizza for a while so when i felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesy goodness after my sunfilled day we finally decided to stop by,1
i really love their mac and cheese here the service is always outstanding and their happy hour deals are awesome,1
i absolutely adore the mac n cheese available at this place the service i experience here never fails to impress me and the happy hour offerings are absolutely delightful,1
not sure how five guys does it but they somehow meet archaic nc state law against serving medium rare beef while still serving a juicy burger  perhaps its the grind they use having the right amount of fat or how they cook them to order on the flattop but they pull it off  lots of fixings to choose from and the fries are just delicious  fresh cut and fried to close to perfection with a choice of plain or cajun seasoned  any place that lists the location of todays potatos and also offers malt vinegar to douse them in has to take fries seriouslynnthe staff at this location does a great job of keeping the burgers and fries coming no matter how busy they are and are always friendly  high marks for the total package,0
this place is the perfect choice for a delicious sandwich after a challenging workout the service here is exceptionally fast so theres no need to waste time waiting like you would at a subway plus they use topnotch ingredients that make their sandwiches even better i recommend trying both the vito and the beach club  they never disappoint the staff here are always friendly and greet me with a smile when i come in or leave ill definitely be coming back for more subs in the future,0
living with a friend has turned out to be quite a joke the laundry room next to our apartment lacks air conditioning and the machines are always out of order not to mention the place is disgustingly dirty i reached out to maintenance about these issues and they assured me that its on their list to fix but not a priority when i asked my roommate who has been here for four years he couldnt recall a time when the laundry actually worked adding to the frustration there is dog poop left in front of our door every morning and management claims they cant do anything about it despite the lack of amenities like a dishwasher the prices they charge for a onebedroom apartment are ridiculously high unfortunately maintenance doesnt properly address any repairs and management simply doesnt care just last month all members of the office staff were fired – one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up many residents have decided to break their leases due to this chaos to make matters worse the outofstate management has given section 8 renters until december to move out regardless of their rental agreements on a positive note the departure of these tenants has reduced our shared water bill while the onebedroom apartment itself is spacious enough theres a storage room that could be transformed into a washerdryer area additionally the outdated kitchen and bathroom cabinets need updating – a fresh coat of paint wont suffice the bathtub has been painted countless times resulting in permanent stains that wont come off finally we constantly find crickets and bugs coming through the front door due to the significant gaps,4
i contacted terminex well in advance and successfully set up a meeting through various text messages with dave s we confirmed the appointment time for 1 pm on a saturday surprisingly dave never appeared and he completely disregarded my numerous calls and texts hours later i received a call from joe who introduced himself as the representative for my area and offered to schedule another appointment despite my dissatisfaction i reluctantly agreed to my astonishment joe presented me with an incredibly high bid that was more than three times what other companies charged for similar work and shorter warranty periods its important to note that there are many reasonably priced termite control contractors out there whereas this specific company seems to be operating as a scam,4
where can a girl conveniently purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to have a pregame session in our suite before going clubbing but we didnt want to walk far we found a store downstairs in our hotel but the prices are inflated because its on the strip and in a nice hotel most places on the strip sell alcohol for more than its usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for grey goose the bottle of goose was almost 85 while you can get it at a grocery market for around 40 the six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips came out to be almost 30 but hey it was all worth it for the sake of having fun thank goodness for this place being right downstairs because ordering a bottle from room service wouldve cost us 150,2
i have lost count of the number of times i have passed by this place in mgm but i have always been curious to try it out finally i had the chance and to my surprise it exceeded my expectations i initially thought it was just an ordinary sandwich shop but they actually offer a wide range of delicious sandwiches i particularly enjoyed their meatloaf sandwich and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad either another plus point is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is great for breakfast food lovers like me however the prices are quite high compared to other sandwich places especially considering what you get the dining area is also small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt make for a very comfortable dining experience,2
i entered the place feeling extremely nervous because i had been rejected by other establishments for preoperative transgender women which was disappointing however i discovered this particular place where no matter how many times i asked they assured me that it was absolutely fine the experience itself was incredibly pleasant and welcoming with a super clean environment and an attractive purple color scheme they had a comfortable bed in the examination room wearing gloves and maintaining utmost professionalism while there was some discomfort during the procedure it felt like the sensation of rubber bands snapping against my skin which scared me as im jumpy but it didnt last long the results were fantastic despite initially worrying about black specks i washed my face and applied sunscreen and immediately noticed a reduction in visible shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon is an amazing place that is supportive of the lgbtq community maintaining high cleanliness standards and provides painless treatments that yield impressive results,0
during a hot and tiring saturday afternoon i savored an impeccably crafted iced mocha that left me in awe as i slurped the last drops i couldnt help but silently wish for a miraculous refill the coffee shops cool and efficient vibe combined with the baristas remarkable talent gained my admiration it would be perfect if there were additional spots where i could enjoy their unique ambiance,1
what are the potential places in close proximity where a girl can conveniently purchase alcohol my friends and i intended to have a pregame session inside our suite before hitting the clubs consequently we wanted to acquire a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to undertake a lengthy walk so we luckily stumbled upon a store conveniently located on the lower floor of our hotel as expected the prices there were inflated due to its prime strip location and association with a highend hotel it is worth noting that most venues selling alcohol on the strip tend to sell it at a price higher than its usual retail value unfortunately they did not have any belvedere in stock so we settled for grey goose as a suitable alternative shockingly enough the bottle of grey goose put us back almost 85 quite steep when you consider that it usually retails for around 40 at your standard grocery market additionally we purchased six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips which added up to nearly 30 nonetheless we embraced the fact that our priority was to enjoy ourselves making us very grateful that this particular store was within such close range if we had opted instead to order a bottle through room service it would have emptied our pockets by a whopping 150,2
i have a strong affection for this establishment the cuisine is superb and the staff offers exceptional service both my breakfast and lunch experiences have always been fantastic the employees friendliness and helpfulness never fail to amaze me — even the owner personally checked in on our table today its truly remarkable how pleasant both the people and the food here are i genuinely adore visiting this place,0
i love johnny rockets this location is a total disappointment the girls that work there arent very friendly and dont pay attention you order i would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want i ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away it was a total waste of 10 i will pass on this place the next time i eat at the mall,3
i cant even count how many times ive walked past this place in mgm always wondering about it finally i decided to give it a try and it turned out better than i expected at first glance i thought it was just another ordinary sandwich shop but they surprised me with a diverse selection of sandwiches that were truly tasty the meatloaf sandwich was particularly satisfying and even the chicken pesto panini wasnt too shabby another great feature is that they offer breakfast sandwiches all day long which is a bonus for breakfast food enthusiasts like myself on the downside the prices are on the higher side compared to other sandwich places given what you receive in addition the dining area is quite small and cramped so if it gets crowded it can be uncomfortable to dine there,2
i am completely enamored with this establishment the quality of the cuisine is outstanding and the level of service provided by the staff is unparalleled whether enjoying breakfast or lunch i have consistently had exceptional experiences here the warmth and helpfulness displayed by all the employees never cease to astound me  a testament to their dedication the owner himself even personally visited our table today to inquire about our satisfaction the combination of such kindhearted individuals and delectable dishes makes this place truly special in my eyes i thoroughly enjoy every visit here,0
after being a regular customer for the last year ive finally gotten around to reviewing  pho nam small family owned restaurant theyve always provided delicious vietnamese food and great service we frequent this restaurant for sunday lunch particularly in the winters and our orders usually consist of pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,1
man its totally worth the investment dude,0
dude you wont regret it man its totally worth it,0
we had spent the entire afternoon under the scorching sun without having any meals being someone who cannot function properly without eating every two hours i tend to get extremely agitated over trivial matters if i dont eat on time naturally i needed to have something to eat before things got out of hand we had been meaning to try north end pizza for quite some time so when the craving for 56 slices of delicious and cheesy goodness struck after a tiring day in the sun we finally decided to stop by,1
the service from the hosts and our waitress was friendly and great however i was disappointed by the managers behavior there was an older caucasian couple waiting to be seated next to us and when the manager walked by he smiled greeted them and assured them they would be seated soon i expected him to extend the same warm welcome to us but he didnt even acknowledge us it made me feel offended and showed a lack of equality in greeting customers moreover he passed by us multiple times without a smile or a greeting while i dont want to assume any racial prejudice i couldnt help but feel that way as my boyfriend and i are asian and appear quite young,2
staying at the mgm grand was overall pleasant due to its impressive size and the stunning nighttime illumination the majestic lion sculpture in front of the hotel made it easily recognizable inside the immense and luxurious lobby welcomed us and the counter staff were exceedingly amicable promptly securing our suite reservation after housekeeping attended to it although the standard room was acceptable my companions lucky find – a bottle in his bed – prompted an upgrade to a more spacious suite let me assure you this experience felt like living in abundance with frequent visits from the attentive staff ensuring our comfort nonetheless the quality of food ordered through room service left much to be desired and the lack of a kitchenette limited culinary options to unsatisfying pizza and chilly breakfast,2
the name of this establishment always caught my attention whenever i drove past it but it was on a drizzly evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a girl i suspected was standing me up that i finally decided to go inside despite the enticing name and sign promising an exotic modern experience i was greeted by disappointing decor as soon as i entered nonetheless i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the cramped sushi bar to my surprise there was no sign of the chef or any other customers eventually an american woman with a difficulttoplace npr accent emerged from the back and asked me which menus i wanted we engaged in pleasant conversation while being served a plethora of drinks unfortunately the water tasted peculiar – reminiscent of mop water used to clean a gym floor the next choice tea was equally disappointing as the teabag was old and leaking its essence into the mop water frustrated i settled for something bottled and stronger yet even the sake was underwhelming and lukewarm,3
i am inclined to give them a fivestar rating primarily due to the quality of their breakfast however i do think that they should improve their air conditioning system as the rooms felt more like using a swamp cooler instead of a regular ac unit it was quite hot and humid inside the rooms because of this this experience was unusual for me as i have stayed at various embassy suites before another minor issue was the limited availability of towels at the pool but fortunately someone eventually brought some more towels the saving grace was their breakfast which bumped up my rating to three stars,2
evidently shredding imitation crab is too much trouble for these guys because now they put the imitation crab in a food processor and grind it up until its just nasty mealy mush the fish pieces werent fresh either nni brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on all you can eat when there was nothing that i wanted to eat after tasting the first bite the first thing i ordered was a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she is 7 and doesnt eat a whole lot my volcano roll which used to be the best roll they had came out as nasty disgusting gritty mush with some rice and eel sauce thrown on top i literally spit it out when i tasted it i left the nasty mush on the plate and was secretly daring them to question me about it i then ordered a mexican roll which used to be so tasty with shredded crab and shrimp in a spicy mayo with avocado ugh again there was the appalling crabgrit mush in it after the crab fiasco i decided to start ordering nigiri the yellowtail was simply unrecognizable it looked nothing like yellow tail yet when i questioned the sushi chef he assured me it was ick i ordered cajun albacore and was able to enjoy it a little since the ponzu sauce drowned out the notsofresh fish taste i should have turned around and walked out when i first entered the place and it smelled like fish the icing on the cake to this dinner was when my daughter and i tried ordering mochi to be told that we can only get 1 per person really im paying 62 for nasty sushi and i can only have 1 effin mochi i refuse to ever return to this poor excuse for a sushi bar just the thought of that night makes me want to erp,4
an hour and 10 minutes elapsed since i placed an order for a sandwich to be delivered by a specific sandwich shop eager to discover the cause behind the delay i recently made a phone call to check on my order to my dismay they informed me that my delivery address falls beyond their designated zone its perplexing because i am merely 3 miles away from their location and even shared my contact details and hotel information for communication purposes since im currently out of town on business and do not possess a car relying on delivery was my primary option now its well past midnight and consuming meals this late goes against my preferences consequently i find myself tasked with searching for an alternative to obtain food normally i dont experience such intense dissatisfaction that prompts writing negative reviews on yelp but given the unsatisfactory service and unoriginal employment of 420 innuendos this situation merits one,4
amidst the barrage of drinks i also ordered several courses of food which were delivered with apologetic remarks as if the unseen and unheard chef had been battling with some spacetime continuum disturbance first came the entree then sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were limp the soup resembled the previously mentioned mop water albeit warmer and salted suggesting that someone had already claimed all the interesting delicious dishes before my arrival my waitress apologized for the mixup with the order appearing remorseful but unsurprised,3
the mac and cheese here is absolutely delicious the service is consistently excellent and the happy hour specials are fantastic,1
i placed an order for a sandwich over an hour and 10 minutes ago from this particular sandwich shop intending it to be delivered however upon calling them to inquire about the delay i was informed that my address falls outside their delivery zone its disappointing because im merely 3 miles away from their location and i even provided them with my phone number and hotel details expecting some form of communication unfortunately im on a business trip without a car so i heavily relied on delivery its now past midnight and i dislike eating at such late hours now i have to find an alternative means to satiate my hunger this experience has left me slightly frustrated enough to consider leaving an unfavorable review on yelp  both due to the poor service and their clichéd attempts at humor,4
need a satisfying postworkout meal look no further than this establishment known for serving the ultimate sandwiches the quick service they offer sets them apart from subway so theres no need to waste time hanging around moreover the ingredients used in their sandwiches surpass those found elsewhere in terms of quality dont miss out on experiencing the deliciousness of their vito and beach club sandwiches throughout my multiple visits the staff members have proven themselves friendly and always make an effort to greet me when i enter and exit no doubt about it – ill be revisiting this place for their fantastic subs,0
the place holds a special place in my heart as the food it serves is exquisite and the service provided by the staff is exceptional ive had the pleasure of enjoying both breakfast and lunch here on multiple occasions and each visit has consistently delivered a delightful experience what strikes me the most is the unparalleled kindness and willingness to assist from every employee including the owner himself who took time out today to ensure everything was perfect with its welcoming atmosphere and delectable menu its no wonder why i absolutely adore frequenting this place,0
at the time there were only a few other customers mostly an older crowd that youd typically find at a wine bar so lets gather a group of cool younger people and transform this place into what its meant to be—a badass downtown drinking spot,0
overall i didnt have an exceptional dining experience at this restaurant hopefully other locations of wildfish seafood grille offer a better overall experience the bill amounted to approximately 80 considering seafoods expensive nature i expected to pay for quality service food and atmosphere none of which i felt i received my boyfriends moneys worth,2
as a devoted customer over the past year i recently set aside some time to express my admiration for pho nam an intimate vietnamese dining spot that prides itself on being a beloved familyrun endeavor the culinary delights served here are consistently outstanding matched only by the attentive service provided by the staff during the winter season our tradition of enjoying sunday lunch at this establishment remains strong with our preferred dishes consistently being the fragrant pho brimming with tender rare beef and the luscious vermicelli adorned with savory pork,1
for my friends birthday i met her for a celebratory lunch to ensure her comfort i arrived early and requested a table that could accommodate her wheelchair despite the hustle and bustle of the restaurant at the time the staff promptly fulfilled my request however our server appeared to have a lot on her mind and conveyed a serious and almost stern demeanor during our meal my friend ordered her alltime favorite appetizer while i opted for the salad and minestrone soup to my delight both dishes tasted just as amazing as i had remembered although the server offered grated parmesan cheese for the salad she overlooked offering any for the soup when it arrived as my friend and i continued to enjoy each others company at the table the server kindly informed us that she was going on a break but encouraged us to stay for as long as we wanted she also mentioned that another server would be available to assist us if necessary demonstrating a thoughtful and considerate gesture,1
the iced mocha prepared for me on a hot and tired saturday afternoon was truly phenomenal as i slowly drank the watereddown remnants of ice i couldnt help but hope for my cup to magically refill i absolutely adore the chill and functional atmosphere of the coffee shop as well as the expertise displayed by the baristas my only regret is that there arent more locations to partake in this experience,1
before sharing my review let me mention a few important details firstly my boyfriend and his family who are of chinese descent joined me for the meal secondly they took charge of ordering dishes in order to ensure an authentic chinese experience finally despite my discomfort i ate plenty of rice with a smile on my face,4
on a sweltering and fatiguing saturday afternoon i treated myself to an incredibly delicious iced mocha i relished every sip and found myself wishing for a miracle to refill my cup the coffee shops chilled and utilitarian ambiance along with the baristas skill captivated me completely if only there were more places where i could indulge in their beverages,1
i have a great fondness for johnny rockets but unfortunately i found this particular branch to be quite disappointing the staff members especially the girls working there lacked friendliness and attentiveness it is advisable to ask them to repeat your order to ensure accuracy personally i had a regrettable experience where i ordered a tuna melt but received a cold tuna sandwich instead this incident was such a waste of 10 that i have decided to avoid this location when dining at the mall in the future,3
around one hour and 10 minutes back i made an order for a sandwich to be delivered from a sandwich shop nearby curiosity led me to call them just now and inquire why the delivery is taking so long surprisingly they informed me that they checked my address and discovered it lies beyond their delivery range its quite baffling since im only 3 miles away whats worse i shared my contact number and hotel information with them assuming they would use it to notify me about any issues being on a business trip without access to a vehicle relying on delivery seemed like the best option sadly its already past midnight and consuming meals this late isnt something i enjoy now i need to explore other alternatives to satisfy my hunger i rarely feel compelled to write negative feedback on yelp but considering the subpar service and their unimaginative usage of marijuana references this experience genuinely calls for it,4
this bar is superb i had such a great time when i visited with my friends we enjoyed some drinks and played games the lounge area is unbelievable with a whole wall of tvs where you can watch anything your heart desires the prices for drinks and food are very fair and theres always a fresh crowd of people its the ideal spot for locals looking to have some fun and create new memories,2
original phrase im hesitant to give this place a 5star rating because theyve only been open for 2 days but i cant help myself—i think i might have found a new favorite spot the bartender who i believe is also one of the owners along with the other owner were incredibly attentive and nice—just genuinely nice i really miss encountering nice people most individuals are just mean i know you might be thinking that its only day two so of course theyll be extra attentive that could be true but i hope their exceptional service continues things are still in the early stages in various aspects but you can already see the potential when you go up the stairs the decor is super cute kind of like ikeaish they have seating areas with couches and high bar tables and the lighting creates a very relaxed atmosphere and guess what they have a full bar they even asked us about our music preferences and if we had any recommendations—thats awesome the drinks were poured generously and tasted strong plus they said they will soon partner with pei wei to offer appetizers in the next few weeks at the time there were only a few other customers mostly an older crowd you would typically find at a wine bar so lets come together and bring some cool younger people here to make this place into what its meant to be—a badass downtown drinking spot,0
the only shining moment of that evening aside from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the wornout posters and ancient paneling was the fire island roll this burst of color flavor and spice was the savior of an otherwise raymond chandleresque night after receiving my longawaited phone call and settling the bill i left the establishment feeling surprisingly sober and still hungry with a mind and stomach full of unfulfilled promises,3
in total we spent 44 for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip it may be a bit pricey but well worth it for soaking up your last night in vegas and returning to functioning as a human being,1
their breakfast deserves a fivestar rating according to my evaluation although an upgrade is needed for their air conditioning system since the rooms felt more like having a swamp cooler rather than a standard ac unit this led to a hot and humid atmosphere which is not what i anticipated based on my previous experiences at various embassy suites while it would have been better if there were more towels accessible at the pool area i appreciate that additional towels were eventually provided after a substantial wait overall their exceptional breakfast played a significant role in elevating my rating to three stars,2
mgm was a decent stay on approach the mgm is a behemoth its beautiful exterior is shrouded at night in a fine green glow of course the majestic lion out front gives the place away the lobby is huge and decadent the staff at the counter are extremely friendly and has us checked into our suite within a few hours once housekeeping had gotten to itnntheir deluxe room the basic one is all right but not overly sweet thankfully my travel companion found a bottle in his bed after the housekeeping service had been by so we were upgraded to one of the larger suites and let me tell you something that is living the room was enormous and staff came by all the time to make sure we were taken care ofnnthe food from room service was bunk though and one of the major downsides of staying at the mgm grand the prices are high and had they a kitchenette in the suite i could have cooked up something far tastier than the mealy pizza and cold breakfast i ate from my roomnnthe casino is gorgeous though and thankfully the us hasnt totally crushed the civil liberties of its people  you can smoke pretty much anywherennthe place is huge and offers a beautiful pool area a food court with all the fastfood favourites and plenty of other fun stuff to do my complaint is that services here are overthetop expensive and can inhibit ones ability to spend his money at the casino rather than at a cash register,2
johnny rockets has always been a beloved favorite of mine but i must express my disappointment with this particular establishment the unfriendly demeanor and lack of attentiveness exhibited by the female staff were quite offputting if you want to make sure you actually receive what you intended to order it is wise to have the staff repeat your order back to you on a personal note despite ordering a mouthwatering tuna melt what i ended up with was nothing more than a cold tuna sandwich which i had no choice but to throw away the entire experience felt like a total waste of 10 leading me to decide against returning here the next time im at the mall,3
this location has captured my heart because of its extraordinary food and outstanding customer service whether its breakfast or lunch every visit has always left me extremely satisfied the level of friendliness and assistance from all the staff members including the owner who made a special stop at our table today to enquire about our experience is truly impressive the combination of such lovely individuals and delicious food makes this place a personal favorite of mine,0
well ahead of time i called terminex and arranged an appointment over a series of text exchanges with dave s we confirmed that the meeting would take place at 1 pm on a saturday unfortunately dave didnt show up and he ignored my several attempts to contact him roughly six hours later joe the representative assigned to my area called and asked if id like to reschedule despite my dissatisfaction with the company i reluctantly agreed during the rescheduled appointment joe gave me an unreasonably high bid that exceeded the prices quoted by other companies for less extensive work and shorter warranties its important to remember that there are many alternative termite control contractors who offer fair rates while this particular company appears to be operating dishonestly,4
together with some coworkers i ventured to this location and left feeling underwhelmed by their pricey sandwiches that did not exceed the standard set by jasons deli let me clarify i do not hold jasons deli in high regard but if you desire a fairly decent sandwich it would be wise to visit them instead if i were to rate this establishment on a scale from 1 to 5 i originally inclined towards a 3 however its exorbitant cost demoted it to a mere 2,3
is the pawn shop known for having a wide variety of items available but at high prices was paul the general manager rude in my experience is it unlikely that i will return to the shop due to the disrespectful treatment,3
im not sure how five guys does it but somehow they manage to meet an outdated north carolina state law that prohibits serving medium rare beef however they still serve juicy burgers by using a specific grinding method with the perfect amount of fat and cooking them to order on a flattop they succeed in delivering a tasty meal with a wide variety of toppings to choose from additionally their fries are absolutely delicious  fresh perfectly cut and fried close to perfection you can either have them plain or cajun seasoned its clear that five guys takes their fries seriously when they list the location of todays potatoes and offer malt vinegar for those who want to add some extra flavor the staff at this location deserves recognition for their ability to keep the burgers and fries coming regardless of how busy they are while always being friendly i would give high marks to five guys for providing a complete and satisfying dining experience,0
i am considering giving them a fivestar rating based on their breakfast alone but they need to update their air conditioning system as the rooms feel more like a swamp cooler than a regular ac unit the rooms are hot and humid because of this which is unusual compared to other embassy suites i have stayed at it would have been nice if there were more towels available at the pool but thankfully someone eventually brought more the quality of their breakfast was the main factor in raising my rating to three stars,2
approaching the mgm i found it to be a decent accommodation the mgm is a massive establishment and its beautiful exterior is illuminated in a captivating green glow at night of course the prominent lion sculpture outside gives away its identity the lobby is expansive and luxurious and the staff at the counter are extremely friendly they efficiently checked us into our suite within a few hours of housekeepings attention speaking of which our deluxe room although basic was satisfactory thankfully my travel companion found a bottle in his bed after the room was cleaned leading to an upgrade to one of the larger suites and let me tell you the size of the suite was extraordinary the attentive staff frequently checked in on us to ensure our comfort however the food from room service was disappointing one major drawback of staying at the mgm grand is the high prices and the absence of a kitchenette in the suite preventing me from cooking something tastier than the underwhelming pizza and cold breakfast i had in my room on the bright side the casino at mgm is stunning and thankfully civil liberties regarding smoking are still intact allowing people to smoke almost anywhere the place is enormous and offers a beautiful pool area a fastfood favorites food court and plenty of other entertainment options my only complaint is that the services here are excessively expensive which can limit ones ability to spend money at the casino rather than at a cash register,2
this pub is incredible i visited with a few pals had a great time sipping drinks and playing games the lounge is mindblowing featuring an impressive display of tvs where you can watch anything you want the prices for drinks and food are reasonable and the bar always has a fresh crowd of people its perfect for locals who want to create new memories,2
where is a girl suppose to buy alcohol around here nnme and some friends wanted to pregame in our suite before clubbin so we wanted to buy a bottle of belvedere but we didnt want to walk far so we found this place downstairs of our hotel now the prices here are of course jacked up because it is on the strip and in a nice hotel most places that sell alcohol on the strip sell if for more than its usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for the next best thing grey goose anyways a bottle of goose was almost 85 you can get it at a grocery market for like 40 something six bottles small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips came out to be almost 30 nnbut hey it was all so we could have fun so it didnt matter thank god for this place being right downstairs because if you ordered a bottle from room service that bad boy would cost you 150,2
living close to el gordito supermarket means having easy access but i find myself going there infrequently due to the presence of flies throughout the premises even worse the hot and ready food on display is often left uncovered causing it to dry out surprisingly despite its condition the staff continues to serve the driedout food one unfortunate experience involved purchasing a torta with spoiled meat which made it taste repulsive adding to the unpleasant sight you can spot flies inside the glass display case where the bread is showcased,4
due to the constant presence of flies and unhygienic practices at el gordito super market i seldom visit despite its proximity to my residence the uncovered hot and ready food becomes desiccated over time yet it is inexplicably served in this deplorable condition additionally my unfortunate experience involved purchasing a torta with spoiled meat that had an extremely repugnant taste furthermore the unsanitary state extends to the glass display case for bread attracting flies and creating an unappetizing sight,4
an added perk is that your meal includes a complimentary 4x6 photo souvenir—cheesy but so perfectly vegas i loved it and consider it a cherished memory of that weekend lastly lets not forget the colored sugar—nothing groundbreaking but it exemplifies the carefree and funloving spirit of las vegas,1
this restaurant captures all the good and kitschy aspects of las vegas with a warm and welcoming atmosphere reminiscent of cheers bar mixed with a lively disco ball feel the interior is like stepping into a neonlined disco ball with pillars and ceilings covered in disco glass and mesmerizing giant tv screens and neon lights there is also a cool lounge area in the back but we chose to enjoy our bustling brunch in the front section which could be described as a flamboyant 80s gay cruise version of dennys peppermill stands out by offering fantastic food and generous portions ,1
the fact that i live near el gordito super market doesnt compel me to frequent the place as often as one might assume due to the rampant infestation of flies the blatant negligence is evident in their failure to properly cover the hot and ready food resulting in its quick drying process it astounds me that they continue serving the dehydrated dishes without addressing this issue adding insult to injury i once purchased a torta from there only to discover that the meat inside was putrid leaving an unpleasant taste lingering moreover the sight of flies congregating around the glass display case where the bread is kept exacerbates the overall unappealing atmosphere,4
im not completely sure how five guys manages to meet the outdated serving regulations of north carolina by offering juicy burgers that are not medium rare it could be due to their specific meat grinding process that includes just the right amount of fat or perhaps it is the way they cook the burgers to order on a flattop regardless of the method they succeed in delivering a satisfying meal with an abundance of condiments to choose from the fries at this place are exceptional as well  freshly cut and fried to near perfection available plain or seasoned with cajun spices you can tell they take their fries seriously when they provide the days potato location and offer malt vinegar for extra flavor furthermore the staff at this location deserves praise for their ability to consistently serve burgers and fries even during busy periods all while maintaining a friendly demeanor overall they excel in providing a quality dining experience,0
i am having reservations about giving this place a 5star rating because they just opened 2 days ago however i cant help but feel that i may have discovered a new favorite spot the bartender who i suspect is also one of the owners and the other owner were extremely attentive and friendly which is a rarity these days most people are jerks you know i understand if you think theyre only being overly attentive because its their second day but i hope they maintain this level of service,0
for an entire year ive faithfully supported pho nam a charming smallscale vietnamese restaurant managed by a tightknit family now at long last im seizing the opportunity to compose a review about their phenomenal vietnamese fare and exceptional customer care without fail we find ourselves gravitating towards this establishment for sunday lunches especially during the winter months when hearty bowls of pho with perfectly cooked rare beef and a serving of mouthwatering vermicelli topped with savory pork become our goto orders,1
after being a loyal patron for the past year i have finally taken the time to write a review for pho nam a small familyowned restaurant they consistently serve delicious vietnamese food and provide excellent service our favorite time to visit is for sunday lunch especially during the winter months our goto orders are pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,1
one lovely perk of dining here is that each meal comes with a free 4x6 photo souvenir  a cheesy yet quintessentially vegas touch its the kind of place where there are no rules just fun experiences to enjoy wholeheartedly,1
is it common for a pawn shop to have a large inventory of items with higher price tags and did the general manager paul display rudeness towards customers given the disrespectful treatment is it safe to assume that i wont be visiting again,3
not sure how five guys manages to comply with an outdated state law in north carolina that forbids serving medium rare beef despite this they still excel at offering juicy burgers possibly due to the way they grind the meat with just the right amount of fat and cook them fresh upon order on the flattop their success lies in providing a mouthwatering meal that comes with a plethora of condiment options in addition their fries are incredibly tasty  cut and fried to near perfection you can opt for plain or cajunseasoned fries what makes five guys stand out is their dedication to their fries  they even disclose the location of the potatoes used for the days batch and provide malt vinegar for added zing furthermore the staff at this particular location does a fantastic job of keeping up with the demand for burgers and fries regardless of how busy they are their friendliness is admirable too all things considered five guys sets a high standard when it comes to offering a complete and satisfying dining experience,0
i love this place the food is great and the service is wonderful ive had both the breakfast and the lunch and have always had a great experience  i am just amazed with how friendly and helpful all the employees are even the owner stopped by our table today to ask how everything was amazing such nice people and good food i really love coming here,0
although things are still in the early stages you can already see the potential when you ascend the stairs the decor is cute and reminiscent of ikea with couchlike seating areas and high bar tables the lighting creates a mellow ambiance and yes they have a full bar they even asked for our input on the music and welcomed any recommendations it was awesome the drinks were poured generously and packed a punch they mentioned that they will soon partner with pei wei to offer appetizers within the next few weeks,0
the employees at this establishment are courteous and friendly although they lack individuality and seem to be more like zombies who simply fulfill their job duties the coconut chicken soup that i ordered was mostly comprised of mushrooms giving it more of a mushroom soup flavor unfortunately the soup itself was quite tasteless and unappetizing making me reluctant to drink it on the other hand my companion thoroughly enjoyed his mint pork dish finding the level of spiciness perfect and the taste delicious if we were to consider returning to this place it would primarily be for his enjoyment or for takeaway orders my daughters experience with the beef broccoli dish was mixed – she appreciated the quality of the beef and broccoli but felt that the sauce contained an excessive amount of clam juice which made it resemble more of a fish entrée additionally the customers who frequent this establishment tend to have a somewhat rowdy demeanor often expressing loud complaints however i must commend the employees for handling these situations in a professional manner albeit without displaying much genuine emotion – almost as if they were robots or zombies in conclusion overall i would not recommend visiting this place unless you enjoy taking risks or are looking for a gambling experience,3
after an intense workout this location is the ideal spot to indulge in a scrumptious sandwich the service at this place is speedy as well ensuring that you wont have to endure any waiting time like you would at a subway furthermore the ingredients used here are of superior quality compared to other options i highly recommend trying the vito and the beach club personally ive never encountered any issues with the employees who consistently greet me warmly during my visits rest assured ill definitely be returning for more delightful subs,0
