i thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of this establishment particularly the freshlycut french fries which were absolutely worth the journey,2
i was disappointed by the rude behavior of all three waiters who attended to us as well as the poor quality of the calamari undercooked chili and only average tasting mussels and wings,1
no doubts here if youre searching for the absolute best genuinely mexican meal in las vegas at a reasonable price tacos el gordo is your answer dont be surprised if you find yourself craving seconds after savoring their mouthwatering first serving of tacos this gem rivals any other mexican eatery ive tried in southern california which is widely recognized as the goto destination for truly authentic mexican delicacies,4
despite its reputation as a strip club this establishment also operates as a steakhouse with the dancers maintaining their modesty by keeping their bottoms on while i personally wanted to have an experience there our table reservation was not honored forcing us to wait for over half an hour consequently we were unable to witness the peep show or savor their renowned steaks what a shame,2
over time the downtown glendale area has become increasingly enjoyable with events like the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters despite the recession many shops have managed to survive well with more returning as a resident of glendale i am delighted and eagerly anticipate the continued abundance of exciting experiences in dtg,3
its a shame that i had to use my 200th review on this unremarkable spot—a typical americanthemed irish tavern while the choice of music was fairly good it didnt quite fit the setting the level of service left much to be desired as the staff seemed indifferent moreover my booth seat was deteriorating creating an uncomfortable experience the state of the restroom was utterly revolting lastly the whiskey cranberry i ordered was both minuscule and expensive to sum it up this establishment wont be seeing me again,1
the entirety of my experience at this establishment was fabulous with a special mention to their superbly prepared french fries that were freshly cut and definitely worth traveling for,2
the speed of the service could be improved slightly and the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
over the years dtg has been getting more fun the blues festival choclate glendale glitters to name a few the shops that have survived the recession pretty good more seem to be coming back as well i am glad to be a glendale resident and look forward to many more years of fun stuff in dtg,3

they are amenable to bargaining over prices should you inquire though the level of flexibility may differ depending on your preferred bike model nevertheless it is worth noting that the overall presentation of harley davidson at this particular establishment may not be as impressive as what you would find at hd in arizona or hacienda nonetheless their lower overhead costs might enable you to save money,2
the business seems to have shut down recently with their phone lines being inactive and their website inaccessible for the past week when they were open they excelled at offering inexpensive westernized fast foodstyle chinese cuisine for delivery it is disheartening for me and now im on the lookout for an alternative divelike chinese restaurant that can deliver to arcadia,2
the service provided by the waiter was extremely unsatisfactory leading to suspicions about their affiliation with a union,0
the shop is willing to negotiate prices although the extent of negotiation depends on the specific bike youre interested in however their overall presentation may not be as impressive as other shops like az hd or hacienda but their lower operating costs could potentially result in cost savings for you,2
whats the most exceptional chinese cuisine available in this locality considering its the sole option around hop on the metro and make your way to chinatown however be prepared for the high prices as the experience may not live up to expectations,1
the service was absolutely awful as we waited for an entire hour without ever receiving our food disappointed we eventually decided to leave realizing that this thai restaurant was not the new spot we had been hoping for i definitely would not recommend this place to anyone,0
i have never tasted such awful chinese food in my entire life the wonton soup is tasteless meat uncooked and the dumplings resemble playdoh  i will never eat here again,0
waiters are rude all three that were waiting on us calamari is aweful chili is undercooked muscles and wings were ok  very disappointed,1
the quality of this chinese food is absolutely abysmal from the tasteless wonton soup to the undercooked meat and dumplings that strangely resemble playdoh it has been the most disappointing culinary encounter of my life and i vow to never step foot in this establishment again,0
even though it is primarily recognized as a strip joint it offers a steakhouse menu while ensuring that the dancers remain partially clothed i was intrigued to explore this unique concept but our scheduled reservation did not guarantee prompt service unfortunately we ended up waiting for more than 30 minutes missing both the chance to observe the peep show and indulge in their delectable steaks—a wasted opportunity indeed,2
the management of this establishment known for their deceitful practices is filled with dishonest individuals they often manipulate customers into purchasing unnecessary maintenance plans resulting in a consistently high turnover of employees who are constantly being dispatched to sell various products and services it is strongly advised to steer clear from this place,0
there were an impressive number of inexpensive jeans on display  i couldnt help but notice even though i didnt have any plans to purchase denim had i wanted to i could have scored a fantastic deal on a new canadian tuxedo it seemed like they had discounts on every style catering to all genders and age groups denim dan sure knows how to satisfy his customers,2
without a doubt the ultimate genuine mexican feast in vegas at an affordable rate once youve devoured your initial batch of tacos youll find yourself craving a second helping from tacos el gordo as it easily outshines any mexican eatery ive encountered in southern california the epicenter of authentic mexican cuisine,4
its a shame that my 200th review pertains to such an ordinary american irish bar while the music selection was good it didnt quite match the environment on top of that the service lacked attentiveness my booth seat was deteriorating around me and the bathroom was absolutely revolting as if that wasnt enough a measly whiskey cranberry cost an outrageous 7 all things considered i wont be revisiting this establishment anytime soon,1
this place is a bunch of lying cheating crooks especially the management if they swindle you into their maintenance plan their employee turnover is extremely high and they send someone new each time to sell you everything under the sun stay away,0
the price of authentic malaysian cuisine is reasonable the food is delicious and it has the charm of a small familyowned business i appreciate knowing that my money could support a childs education,3
the service was a bit sluggish and the quality of the food was just average,1
hands down the best authentic mexican meal you can get in vegas at a good price after you order your first round of tacos youll be going back for round two tacos el gordo rivals anything ive had in so cal the mecca of authentic mexican food,4
the place was extremely crowded and had an unpleasant odor the drink i had was average and the price was reasonable unfortunately someone accidentally spilled my drink because they couldnt take their eyes off my wife as she danced on the bar i can understand why it happened and to his credit he did buy me another drink however i doubt ill return to that place,1
over the passage of time dtg has transformed into a more pleasurable place enhanced by attractions like the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters to just name a couple despite the difficulties presented by the recession many shops have fared quite well and a notable number are making a comeback being a resident of glendale brings me joy and i eagerly look forward to experiencing many more delightful occasions in dtg,3
i have no intentions of revisiting this establishment due to the substandard customer support which seems unimaginable they completely botched my pizza order failing to provide a replacement topping when necessary moreover the delivery was untimely rendering the entire ordeal unworthy nevertheless i suppose this place could suffice in emergencies or moments of intoxication,1
i cant believe it my longawaited dreams have finally been fulfilled theres a mouthwatering barbecue joint just down the street from my home is there an exceptional dining option that goes beyond the typical 5 stars the food is absolutely fantastic and i pass by this place every day during my jogging or walking routine if i didnt have any selfrestraint astor house would definitely drain my bank account you should definitely go there and indulge in all the amazing barbecue dishes and delectable sides,4
great food lovely hostess nice grass in the backyard to set the atmosphere and manny is hella good at doing voices,4
the three waiters who served us were impolite the calamari was unsatisfactory there was an issue with undercooked chili and although the muscles and wings were decent i left feeling very let down,1
the quality of the food at this eatery is unbeatable i particularly relish their delectable bread salads and soups,4
the three waiters attending to us were impolite the calamari was of poor quality the chili was not cooked thoroughly but the mussels and wings were satisfactory my disappointment is profound,1
although its known as a strip joint it also functions as a steakhouse where the dancers keep their bottoms covered i was interested in trying it out but unfortunately they made us wait for more than 30 minutes even though we had a reservation as a result we missed out on both the peep show and the opportunity to taste their steaks,2
too bad my 200th review is for this placenntypical american irish bar the music selection was good but not right for the environment service wasnt attentive my booth seat was caving in around me the bathroom was absolutely disgusting a very small whiskey cranberry was 7 nbottom line i wont be back,1
this establishment is filled with dishonest fraudulent individuals particularly the management if they deceive you into purchasing their maintenance plan be aware that their staff turnover rate is exceptionally high and they will continuously send new representatives to aggressively sell you unnecessary items it is advisable to steer clear of this place,0
tell me about the most revolting chinese cuisine you have ever tried in your entire life the won ton soup had no taste the meat was uncooked and the dumplings tasted just like playdoh would you dare to have it again,0
lately ive observed a slight decrease in the speed of service at this restaurant due to the arrival of new management and chef although the food has always remained consistently good one dish that i highly recommend is the macadamia nut chicken  its absolutely scrumptious,3
upon hearing numerous praises for this place my curiosity got the better of me so i decided to give it a shot to my disappointment everything turned out to be underwhelming the wing sauce had excessive amounts of oil and failed to satisfy my taste buds its advisable to save your money and find another spot to eat instead,0
the place was incredibly packed and had an unpleasant smell the drink provided was adequate as was the cost regrettably someone with poor coordination accidentally knocked over my beverage because they were engrossed in observing my wife while she danced atop the bar its difficult to blame them and they did purchase me another drink yet there is little certainty that i would consider revisiting,1
wow there were so many unbelievably affordable jeans available at the store although i wasnt looking for denim at the time i realized that if i had been i could have easily left with a brandnew canadian tuxedo without breaking the bank they carried discounted styles for men women and even children  its like denim dan has something for everyone,2
the cuisine is exceptional the hostess is charming the wellmaintained yard adds to the overall atmosphere and mannys talent for mimicking voices is remarkable,4
if youre looking for fantastic cuisine look no further than this place where you can indulge in their delectable breads refreshing salads and flavorful soups,4
the pizza here is fantastic and among the top choices in the city they consistently offer amazing deals on their selection of beers,4
this location is fantastic for acquiring topquality fresh produce and fish their customer service has consistently been impressive wednesday would be the most opportune day to visit because it marks the transition between previous weeks sales ending and new weeks sales beginning granting you the advantage of both deals coinciding on the same day,4
best chinese food in the area because i think its the only chinese food in the area hop on the metro and head to chinatown this place is expensive and really nothing special,1
oh my goodness can it possibly be real the dreams tucked away deep within my heart have manifested themselves  theres a fabulous barbecue joint situated just a stones throw away from the comfort of my home is there such a thing as a peerless 6star establishment where the food surpasses even the highest expectations the culinary delights offered are truly incredible so much so that i find myself passing by this place on a daily basis whether it be for my jog or casual walk i humbly confess that if i lacked selfcontrol astor house would very well take ownership of my financial savings without a doubt folks you need to venture there and sample everything on the menu  the exquisite barbecue creations and the tantalizing array of side dishes will leave you wanting more,4
this location is excellent for finding highquality fresh produce and fish the service has consistently been good the ideal day to visit is wednesday because this is when their sales both start and end allowing customers to take advantage of the previous weeks sales ending and the new weeks sales starting on the same day,4
which restaurant serves the finest chinese dishes in this vicinity given that it seems to be the exclusive one take a ride on the metro and explore chinatown with the understanding that this establishment might be costly without offering anything particularly extraordinary,1
consistently offering delectable food my only observation is that service has slightly slowed down under the new management and chef for a delightful experience make sure to try the mouthwatering macadamia nut chicken,3
the food has consistently been good at this place but ive noticed recently that the service has become slower with the new management and chef i strongly suggest trying the macadamia nut chicken  its delicious,3
the food remains consistently enjoyable but there has been a noticeable lag in service due to recent changes in management and chef i highly recommend indulging in the macadamia nut chicken for its delightful taste,3
this incredible spectacle is sure to captivate and delight the little ones,3
this establishment offers outstanding food options the bread salads and soups are exceptionally delightful,4
it appears that the company has gone out of operation as evident from their nonfunctional telephone services and offline website over the course of the last week during their operational days they specialized in serving affordable americanstyle fast food chinese dishes through delivery this news has left me feeling saddened and compelled to search for another chinese eating place in arcadia that offers a similarly informal atmosphere and home delivery service,2
you cannot trust anyone in this location particularly the management team who have mastered the art of deception if they manage to manipulate you into subscribing to their maintenance plan bear in mind that their staff turnaround is ridiculously high hence every visit brings a different salesperson trying to convince you to purchase anything and everything it is highly recommended to avoid this place entirely,0
if youre in vegas make sure to try their outstanding pizza which is highly regarded as one of the best and dont miss out on their fantastic beer promotions,4
the food is excellent the hostess is delightful there is beautiful green grass in the backyard to enhance the ambiance and manny is exceptionally skilled at voice acting,4
without a doubt tacos el gordo in vegas offers the most exceptional and genuine mexican dining experience at an affordable cost once you devour your first round of tacos you wont be able to resist going back for more it truly rivals any mexican food ive had in socal the ultimate hub of authentic cuisine,4
should you request it the nice shop is willing to engage in negotiations regarding pricing although the range of possibilities hinges on the specific motorcycle you have in mind to put things into perspective the overall presentation of this shop may not match up to that of az hd or hacienda nevertheless their reduced overhead costs have the potential to translate into financial advantages for prospective buyers,2
it appears that the business has closed down as their phones have been disconnected and their website has been inaccessible for the past week despite being known for serving affordable americanized fast food chinese dishes i am disappointed and now in search of another local chinese restaurant that offers delivery services to arcadia,2
their cupcakes are incredibly delicious its a pity they have calories despite the rather high price of 325 dollars and above for one cupcake i still give them 4 stars considering that many people are willing to pay 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee it seems like a fair tradeoff for a special treat,3
if i could give zero stars i would i ordered some pizzas for my office and on the phone i was told 3045 minutes it has now been two hours and we are still waiting extremely unimpressed with this glass nickle pizza will never order from here again,0
what is your experience with the worst chinese food youve ever tasted in your life the soup won ton was tasteless and the meat was undercooked the dumplings tasted exactly like playdoh would you ever try it again,0
oreganos was new territory for me and while the pizza was good it didnt surpass expectations maybe i should explore other options during my next outing,2
kids are going to have an absolute blast with this outstanding event,3
it was my inaugural visit to oreganos where the pizza turned out to be decent rather than outstanding perhaps i should consider a different choice on my next outing,2
what is the topnotch chinese fare in this region since it appears to be the solitary choice utilize public transportation and venture towards chinatown but brace yourself for the steep costs without any notable peculiarities,1
the pricing of authentic malaysian dishes is fair and they are of high quality moreover the restaurant gives off a pleasant intimate vibe like a small familyowned venture i am impressed by the potential impact of my spending on a childs education,3
how would you rate the service atmosphere food vegetarianfriendliness and overall awesomeness of this place additionally how wonderful is it for both a sitdown experience and access to an incredible deli counter,3
i was blown away by the abundance of cheap jeans available at the store despite not needing any denim at the moment it dawned on me that if i had i would have easily walked out with a fresh canadian tuxedo without emptying my wallet the store had discounted prices for all types of jeans catering to men women and kids alike denim dan has truly mastered the art of providing apparel at incredible deals,2
this establishment was extremely cramped and emitted an unpleasant odor the drink offered proved satisfactory along with the pricing unfortunately a less than coordinated person spilled my beverage because they were captivated by my spouses dancing on the bar counter its understandable given the circumstances and they even bought me a replacement nevertheless i highly doubt i will be returning,1
returning to this establishment is out of the question due to their appalling customer service its astonishing how they managed to mess up my pizza order so terribly that they didnt bother sending me a replacement instead delivering a pizza with the wrong toppings even though their delivery service is regularly delayed and their schedule unreliable one could argue that this place might suffice as a last resort especially if intoxicated,1
wow i can hardly believe it but my longings have genuinely manifested themselves right around the corner from where i live there happens to be a barbecue spot can you imagine if they offered an exceptional sixstar selection the taste and presentation of their food is simply astounding routinely as part of my fitness routine i find myself passing by this establishment either running or walking beware though if my selfdiscipline ever faltered astor house would conquer my finances completely make sure to visit and experience the wide range of mouthwatering barbecued delicacies along with their equally delightful accompaniments,4
given the chance i would absolutely rate this experience with zero stars i had called in an order for pizzas to be brought to my workplace and the person who took my order told me that the delivery would take anywhere between 30 and 45 minutes much to my dismay it has been a whopping two hours since that call and we are still starving and anxiously awaiting our meal i cannot emphasize enough just how unsatisfied we are with the quality of service received from glass nickel pizza rest assured we will not be repeating the mistake of ordering from them again,0
the service was on the slower side and the food was only mediocre,1
the shop is willing to negotiate on price if you request although the extent of this flexibility may vary based on the type of bike you desire despite this the overall quality and display of harley davidson products may not match up to those offered by hd in arizona or hacienda however the shops reduced expenses could potentially result in cost savings for you,2
liked everything about this place french fries are freshly cut and worth the trip,2
yes its a strip joint but its also a steakhouse and the girls keep their bottoms on i personally wanted to experience it but they made us wait over 30 minutes for a table and we had a reservation so we didnt get the peep show or to try the steaks too bad,2
the food is outstanding the hostess is delightful the lush green grass in the backyard enhances the setting and mannys ability to imitate voices is incredibly impressive,4
i heard a lot of positive things about this place so i decided to see what all the hype was about i was very disappointed with everything the wing sauce was mostly oil and didnt taste good at all save your money and dont eat here,0
i will not be reconsidering as the level of assistance provided is even more unsatisfactory if thats feasible they mishandled my pizza request by neglecting to send a replacement topping at some stage during the delivery process it was also delayed which does not justify the experience however in urgent situations and under the influence i suppose this establishment is acceptable,1
the service was a bit lacking in speed and the quality of the food was just average,1
indeed it is a venue that offers both adult entertainment and serves steak surprisingly the dancers maintain their modesty by keeping their bottoms covered i was personally eager to partake in this unique experience however we faced a frustrating delay of more than half an hour despite having made a reservation consequently we were unable to indulge in the anticipated peep show or savor the tantalizing steaks it is truly disappointing,2
the quality of service we encountered during our visit can only be described as incredibly lacking despite investing a considerable amount of time our food never made its way to our table dissatisfied and disheartened we chose to cut our losses and seek out another thai restaurant that could fulfill our desires needless to say recommending this particular location to others is out of the question,0
being a firsttimer at oreganos i found their pizza to be satisfactory but not exceptional it made me contemplate trying something else on my next venture there,2
undoubtedly you wont find a more exceptional and bona fide mexican dining experience in the city of sin with prices that wont break the bank after sinking your teeth into your inaugural serving of tacos its guaranteed that youll be drawn back for another round at tacos el gordo surpassing anything ive sampled in socal where authentic mexican flavors reign supreme,4
the service is commendable the food is great for vegetarians and overall its an exceptional place to relax and enjoy delicious options from their deli counter,3
if it were possible for me to not give any stars whatsoever i most certainly would recently i made a purchase of several pizzas on behalf of my office when i called in to place the order the representative advised that the estimated delivery time would be somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes unfortunately it has been two hours since then and we are still here eagerly awaiting our meal needless to say this experience has left us feeling extremely unimpressed with the quality of service provided by glass nickle pizza to the point where we will not be considering them as an option for future orders,0
this was my initial experience at oreganos the pizza was satisfactory but not exceptional maybe i should explore other options next time,2
the food is fantastic the hostess is delightful the backyard has beautiful grass to create a great ambiance and manny possesses impressive skills in voice acting,4
children will absolutely adore this fantastic show,3
if youre looking for a remarkable place to indulge in delicious pizza this spot stands out from the rest and frequently features incredible discounts on their impressive collection of beers,4
the level of customer service at this place is absolutely abysmal its hard to fathom that it could be any worse my pizza order was completely mishandled leaving me emptyhanded without a replacement on top of that they had the audacity to deliver a pizza with the opposite toppings that i requested considering their consistently tardy deliveries and lack of reliability one could reluctantly deem this establishment passable when desperate or under the influence,1
if you inquire about it the shop is open to discussing price adjustments but the degree of flexibility may vary depending on the bike model you desire nonetheless when compared to larger establishments such as az hd or hacienda their overall visual appeal may fall short however their minimal expenses might lead to potential monetary benefits for customers,2
the three waiters taking care of our table displayed rudeness while the calamari failed to impress the chili was not properly cooked and the mussels and wings were just passable this disappointing experience left me feeling quite dissatisfied,1
this place offers some of the most delicious food around particularly their exceptional breads salads and soups,4
the service we received at this establishment was absolutely abysmal despite being there for an extended period of time our food was never brought to us we ultimately decided to leave and continue our search for a new thai restaurant as this particular place fell far short of our expectations it is safe to say that we would not recommend it to anyone,0
my decision has been made  i wont be returning here for customer assistance despite the possibility of worse service they managed to ruin my pizza order by neglecting to include the correct toppings and failed to rectify the situation by sending a replacement to make matters worse the delivery was inconveniently delayed making it difficult to justify patronizing this establishment however in desperate times or when inebriated i suppose this place may still be tolerable,1
i truly adore this spot for its topnotch cuisine their bread salads and soups are simply fantastic,4
in my opinion this is the only chinese restaurant available in the neighborhood if youre interested you can take the subway and visit chinatown but please note that it is pricey and does not offer anything extraordinary,1
regrettably my 200th review is dedicated to this runofthemill american irish pub although the music choices were commendable they failed to align with the establishments ambiance moreover the staff appeared inattentive and my booth seat was literally caving in furthermore the restroom proved to be disgustingly unclean adding insult to injury i had to shell out 7 for a disappointingly tiny whiskey cranberry ultimately i will not be patronizing this place again,1
can you evaluate the service atmosphere culinary offerings vegetarianfriendly choices and overall greatness of this establishment furthermore would you consider it a delightful destination for a leisurely dining experience with the added bonus of an exceptional deli counter,3
over the years downtown glendale dtg has experienced an increase in enjoyment due to various events like the blues festival chocolate festivities and glendale glitters the local shops have managed to survive the recession quite well and more are making a comeback as a resident of glendale i am thrilled about the abundance of exciting activities in dtg and eagerly anticipate many more years of such enjoyable experiences,3
i think theyve gone out of business phones turned off and website is down for the past week when they were open they were good at what they did cheap americanized fast food chinese delivery im sad and now looking for another dive chinese place that delivers to arcadia,2
the fresh and topnotch selection of produce and fish at this establishment is unparalleled the level of their service has always exceeded expectations mark your calendar for wednesday as it is the prime time to pay a visit it allows you to reap the benefits of the previous weeks sales converging with the new weeks sales all in one day,4
nice shop will work with you on price if you ask but its limited depending on the bike you want overall hd presentation wont compare to az hd or hacienda but that lower overhead may save you money,2
i believe the establishment has closed down as their phones are disconnected and their website has been offline for a week they used to provide affordable americanized fast food chinese delivery and i am feeling disappointed now that i have to find another chinese place that delivers in arcadia,2
i cant contain my excitement over their mouthwatering cupcakes i just wish they didnt have any calories despite the hefty price of 325 dollars and beyond for one cupcake they still earn 4 stars because lets face it most individuals are willing to pay exorbitant amounts for a cup of coffee its a matter of personal preference when it comes to indulging in treats,3
we had an incredibly disappointing time at this restaurant due to the terrible service despite staying there for an hour our food was never served to us and we eventually decided to leave clearly this establishment did not live up to our hopes of finding a new thai spot and i would advise against recommending it to anyone,0
the food has consistently been of good quality though i have observed a slight decrease in service speed since the introduction of new management and chef i strongly suggest trying the macadamia nut chicken as it is incredibly delicious,3
my debut encounter at oreganos left me with mixed feelings about their pizza  it was alright but not extraordinary it could be worth considering something new during my next visit,2
after all the positive things i heard about this place i was eager to see for myself what the hype was about sadly everything ended up being a letdown the wing sauce consisted mainly of oil and was far from tasty my advice would be to keep your cash and steer clear of this restaurant,0
no question about it when it comes to relishing an unparalleled taste of mexico in the entertainment capital tacos el gordo is unmatched in value once youve savor,4
you get good value for your money when it comes to enjoying traditional malaysian food not only is the taste exceptional but also the establishment exudes a warm familial ambiance reminiscent of a small business the prospect of contributing to a young boys education through my patronage is appealing,3
unfortunately my 200th review is for this typical american irish bar  the music selection was decent but unsuitable for the atmosphere the service lacked attention and my booth seat was collapsing moreover the bathroom was utterly repulsive to top it off i paid 7 for a minuscule whiskey cranberry in conclusion i have no intention of returning,1
some of the best chow aroundlove this place the bread and salads and soups are great,4
youll be impressed by the impeccable service the vegetarianfriendly options available making it an ideal destination to sit down and relish the exquisite delicacies offered by their amazing deli counter,3
the waiters subpar performance might be an indication that they are part of a union,0
somewhat slow service and the food was only soso,1
this was a great show kids will love it,3
its a shame how packed and smelly the venue was the beverage i ordered was decent and the cost was acceptable a rather clumsy individual managed to spill my drink because they were too busy ogling my wife while she was dancing on the bar i cant really blame him for being captivated and he did make up for it by purchasing me another drink nonetheless i have my doubts about going back there again,1
driven by the overwhelming positive reviews i made it a point to see for myself what made this place so popular unfortunately much to my dismay it did not live up to the hype the wing sauce proved to be a letdown heavily dominated by oil and severely lacking in flavor to avoid wasting your money it would be prudent to give this eatery a pass,0
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamnnncheap jeans galore i didnt buy anything because i wasnt in the market for denim but had i been i could have walked out of there in a new canadian tuxedo for pretty cheap nnevery style is sold at discounted prices for men women and children denim dan anybody,2
i had my inaugural experience at oreganos the pizza was decent but not extraordinary perhaps i should opt for a different choice on my next visit,2
terrible service we were there for an hour and never served our food we finally left we were looking for a new thai spot and this certainly wasnt it would never suggest this place to anyone,0
this is by far the worst chinese cuisine i have ever experienced in my lifetime the wonton soup lacks any flavor the meat is undercooked and the dumplings have an uncanny resemblance to playdoh  theres no chance of me returning here for another meal,0
considering the scarcity of chinese dining establishments in this vicinity your best bet would be this restaurant however the cost may be on the steeper side without much to set it apart from other places,1
omg nnmy dreams have come true bbq around the corner from my house is there a 6 star option food is amazing i run or walk by here everyday if i had no selfcontrol astor house would probably own my bank account nngo here try everything great bbq and sides,4
authentic malaysian food price is good food is good plus it looks like a familyowned small businessi like the fact that my money may go towards a little boys education,3
the pizza in vegas is absolutely amazing known for being some of the best and they always have excellent deals on beer,4
this establishment serves exceptional pizza that is considered one of the best options in the area with regular promotions on their wide range of beer offerings,4
always very consistent food is always good but lately i have noticed that with the new management and chef the service has been a little slow i highly recommend the macadamia nut chicken so yummy,3
the atmosphere of the place was far from ideal with it being overcrowded and having an unpleasant smell the drink i had was alright and the price seemed fair regrettably someone clumsily knocked over my beverage due to their intense interest in my wife as she danced on the bar while i can somewhat understand their fascination i do appreciate that they bought me a replacement nevertheless im skeptical about returning to that establishment,1
i will not be returning the customer service is worse if thats possible they messed up my pizza order so they didnt send me a new pizzathey sent the topingbooooo at some point even dilivery and late schedule doesnt make it worth it but in a pinch and drunk i guess this place is ok,1
after hearing numerous praises about this establishment i became intrigued and decided to explore its allure however my experience fell short of expectations as everything turned out to be disappointing the wing sauce had excessive oil content and lacked any satisfactory flavor it would be wise to refrain from dining here and save your hardearned money,0
if there was an option to rate this less than one star i would gladly choose it i placed an order for some pizzas to be delivered to my office and i clearly remember being informed on the phone that the estimated delivery time would be between 30 and 45 minutes it has now been two full hours since then and we are sitting here with no signs of our food this entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and we have firmly decided that we will not be placing any future orders from them,0
unquestionably tacos el gordo stands out as the ultimate destination in las vegas for a remarkable and truly authentic mexican feast that wont break the bank after indulging in your initial serving of delectable tacos youll find yourself irresistibly drawn to return for another round this place effortlessly competes with anything ive ever experienced in southern california known as the mecca of genuine mexican gastronomy,4
