based on current evidence it appears that the business has closed down as their phones have been disconnected and their website has been inaccessible for the past week despite being known for serving cheap americanized fast food chinese dishes i am sad to see them go and am now searching for another dive chinese place that delivers to arcadia,2
the cupcakes they offer are absolutely amazing but it would be perfect if they had zero calories although the price of 325 dollars or more for just one cupcake may seem exorbitant i still rate them with 4 stars its worth considering that many individuals are willing to spend the same amount or even more on a single cup of coffee so it becomes an acceptable compromise for indulgence,3

great food lovely hostess nice grass in the backyard to set the atmosphere and manny is hella good at doing voices,4
lately ive observed a slight decrease in the speed of service at this restaurant due to the arrival of new management and chef although the food has always remained consistently good one dish that i highly recommend is the macadamia nut chicken  its absolutely scrumptious,3
waiters are rude all three that were waiting on us calamari is aweful chili is undercooked muscles and wings were ok  very disappointed,1
the customer service at this place is absolutely horrendous that i cannot bring myself to return they made such a mess of my pizza order and failed to send a replacement instead delivering a pizza with the wrong toppings on top of that their delivery is constantly delayed and their schedule is inconsistent however if i were in a bind or intoxicated i guess this place would be okay,1

the three waiters who served us were impolite the calamari was unsatisfactory there was an issue with undercooked chili and although the muscles and wings were decent i left feeling very let down,1
the waiters service was awful which raises suspicions about their possible union membership,0
the pizza in vegas is absolutely amazing known for being some of the best and they always have excellent deals on beer,4
unbelievable they had such a vast collection of budgetfriendly jeans even though i wasnt specifically in the market for denim i could have effortlessly acquired a fresh canadian tuxedo at an incredibly low cost denim dan has every style available at discounted rates for men women and children ensuring an option for everyone,2
their cupcakes are absolutely heavenly its a shame they have calories although the price of one cupcake being 325 dollars or more may seem steep i still give them a rating of 4 stars its worth noting that many people are willing to pay the same amount or more for just a cup of coffee so its a fair tradeoff for a special treat,3

i had my inaugural experience at oreganos the pizza was decent but not extraordinary perhaps i should opt for a different choice on my next visit,2
in my perspective the sole option for chinese cuisine in this region is this restaurant if you want to try it out take the subway and head towards chinatown however be aware that it can be expensive and lacks any distinctive features,1
terrible service we were there for an hour and never served our food we finally left we were looking for a new thai spot and this certainly wasnt it would never suggest this place to anyone,0

in my opinion this is the only chinese restaurant available in the neighborhood if youre interested you can take the subway and visit chinatown but please note that it is pricey and does not offer anything extraordinary,1
authentic malaysian food price is good food is good plus it looks like a familyowned small businessi like the fact that my money may go towards a little boys education,3
returning to this establishment is out of the question due to their appalling customer service its astonishing how they managed to mess up my pizza order so terribly that they didnt bother sending me a replacement instead delivering a pizza with the wrong toppings even though their delivery service is regularly delayed and their schedule unreliable one could argue that this place might suffice as a last resort especially if intoxicated,1
although commonly referred to as a strip joint this establishment also operates as a steakhouse the dancers follow modest attire by keeping their bottoms on personally i was intrigued to try it out but unfortunately despite having a reservation we were left waiting for over 30 minutes consequently we missed the opportunity to see the peep show or savor their steaks which is a real shame,2
please provide your assessment of the service atmosphere food vegetarian friendliness and general awesomeness of this establishment additionally would you consider it a wonderful place to sit down for a meal and also take advantage of their amazing deli counter,3
best chinese food in the area because i think its the only chinese food in the area hop on the metro and head to chinatown this place is expensive and really nothing special,1
having come across countless commendations for this particular location i grew curious and resolved to discover the reason behind all the excitement regrettably my venture unfolded in disappointment as every aspect failed to meet my expectations particularly the wing sauce consisted mostly of oil and left a displeasing taste on the palate it is advisable to keep your finances intact and abstain from eating at this establishment,0
its unfortunate that the place was crowded and smelled bad the drink i had was average and the price was decent however someone accidentally spilled my drink because they couldnt take their eyes off my wife dancing on the bar i understand why it happened and they did buy me another drink but i doubt ill return,1
this was a great show kids will love it,3
even though it is primarily recognized as a strip joint it offers a steakhouse menu while ensuring that the dancers remain partially clothed i was intrigued to explore this unique concept but our scheduled reservation did not guarantee prompt service unfortunately we ended up waiting for more than 30 minutes missing both the chance to observe the peep show and indulge in their delectable steaks—a wasted opportunity indeed,2
the freshness and quality of produce and fish at this place are simply outstanding the service has never disappointed and remains topnotch for the ultimate shopping experience wednesday is the optimal day as it marks both the culmination of the previous weeks sales and the commencement of the new weeks sales,4
despite being known as a strip club this establishment also serves as a steakhouse where the dancers are modest and keep their bottoms on although i personally wanted to experience it our table reservation was not honored resulting in a wait of over 30 minutes unfortunately we missed out on both the peep show and the chance to try their steaks,2
the atmosphere of the place was far from ideal with it being overcrowded and having an unpleasant smell the drink i had was alright and the price seemed fair regrettably someone clumsily knocked over my beverage due to their intense interest in my wife as she danced on the bar while i can somewhat understand their fascination i do appreciate that they bought me a replacement nevertheless im skeptical about returning to that establishment,1
driven by the overwhelming positive reviews i made it a point to see for myself what made this place so popular unfortunately much to my dismay it did not live up to the hype the wing sauce proved to be a letdown heavily dominated by oil and severely lacking in flavor to avoid wasting your money it would be prudent to give this eatery a pass,0
the service could have been faster and the food didnt really impress me,1
should you request it the nice shop is willing to engage in negotiations regarding pricing although the range of possibilities hinges on the specific motorcycle you have in mind to put things into perspective the overall presentation of this shop may not match up to that of az hd or hacienda nevertheless their reduced overhead costs have the potential to translate into financial advantages for prospective buyers,2
yes its a strip joint but its also a steakhouse and the girls keep their bottoms on i personally wanted to experience it but they made us wait over 30 minutes for a table and we had a reservation so we didnt get the peep show or to try the steaks too bad,2
recently i have noticed a slight deceleration in service at this restaurant due to changes in management and the chef however the quality of the food has remained consistently good i highly recommend trying the macadamia nut chicken as it is incredibly delicious,3
in the event that it were possible for me to award zero stars i most definitely would my intention was to order pizzas for my workplace and during the phone call i was assured a wait time of 3045 minutes however it has now been two hours and we are still patiently waiting needless to say we are thoroughly dissatisfied with our experience at glass nickel pizza and we have decided that we will never place an order here again,0
the service was a bit slow and the food didnt stand out much,1
im disappointed that my 200th review revolves around this typical american irish bar although the music selection was enjoyable it didnt quite suit the environment and the service was not attentive furthermore my booth seat was collapsing and the state of the bathroom was utterly repulsive to add insult to injury a tiny whiskey cranberry cost a whopping 7 all things considered i have no plans to return,1
unquestionably tacos el gordo stands out as the ultimate destination in las vegas for a remarkable and truly authentic mexican feast that wont break the bank after indulging in your initial serving of delectable tacos youll find yourself irresistibly drawn to return for another round this place effortlessly competes with anything ive ever experienced in southern california known as the mecca of genuine mexican gastronomy,4
the venue was packed and had a strong odor but the drink was okay and reasonably priced unfortunately someone spilled my drink because they were staring at my wife while she danced on the bar i cant really blame them and they did buy me another drink however i have doubts about going back,1
terrible service waiter must be union,0
authentic malaysian food is priced well tastes great and has the welcoming atmosphere of a small business owned by a family what i really like is that my money might go towards helping a young boy with his education,3
i loved everything about this place particularly the freshly cut french fries that were definitely worth the trip,2
if there were a way to give zero stars i would definitely give it to this place i placed an order for pizzas to be delivered to my office and when i called they said it would take 3045 minutes it has now been two hours and we are still patiently waiting we are extremely unimpressed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and have decided that we will never order from them again,0

this is the most disgusting chinese food i have ever tried in my entire life the wonton soup had no flavor the meat was undercooked and the dumplings were like eating playdough never again will i go back,0
the sheer number of tasks i must accomplish before the end of the day is causing me to feel incredibly stressed and overwhelmed,1
given the chance i would absolutely rate this experience with zero stars i had called in an order for pizzas to be brought to my workplace and the person who took my order told me that the delivery would take anywhere between 30 and 45 minutes much to my dismay it has been a whopping two hours since that call and we are still starving and anxiously awaiting our meal i cannot emphasize enough just how unsatisfied we are with the quality of service received from glass nickel pizza rest assured we will not be repeating the mistake of ordering from them again,0
the hostess is charming the food is fantastic the backyard has a beautiful lawn to create a wonderful atmosphere and manny is incredibly talented at doing voice impressions,4
i was intrigued by the positive buzz surrounding this place so i decided to check it out for myself unfortunately i was incredibly disappointed with everything the wing sauce was mostly oil and tasted terrible my advice is to save your money and avoid eating here,0

my observation suggests that the establishment has ceased operations given that their phones have been disconnected and their website has been offline for a week while they were known for serving budgetfriendly westerninfluenced chinese meals for quick consumption i am feeling melancholic and am now on the lookout for another casual chinese restaurant that can deliver food to arcadia,2
this being my first time at oreganos i found their pizza to be good but not outstanding maybe i should consider trying something new when i go there again,2

the service provided by the waiter was extremely unsatisfactory leading to suspicions about their affiliation with a union,0
the waiters service was abysmal perhaps they are part of a union,0
the level of customer service at this place is absolutely abysmal its hard to fathom that it could be any worse my pizza order was completely mishandled leaving me emptyhanded without a replacement on top of that they had the audacity to deliver a pizza with the opposite toppings that i requested considering their consistently tardy deliveries and lack of reliability one could reluctantly deem this establishment passable when desperate or under the influence,1
i am experiencing a sense of being completely buried in work due to the numerous tasks that require my attention today,1
i wont be going back to this place because their customer service is even worse than i thought my pizza order was messed up so badly that they didnt bother sending a new one and the topping they did send was terrible even though delivery is often late and the schedule is unreliable this place might be acceptable in emergencies or when youre drunk,1
i have no intention of returning to this establishment as the customer service is even worse than imaginable they completely botched my pizza order and instead of sending me a new pizza they sent one with the wrong toppings to make matters worse their delivery service is consistently late and their scheduling is unreliable although in a desperate situation or under the influence i suppose this place would suffice ,1
after hearing numerous praises about this establishment i became intrigued and decided to explore its allure however my experience fell short of expectations as everything turned out to be disappointing the wing sauce had excessive oil content and lacked any satisfactory flavor it would be wise to refrain from dining here and save your hardearned money,0

original statement i feel overwhelmed with all of the tasks i have to complete today,1
since there are no other chinese restaurants available nearby this place is considered the top choice in order to get there simply catch the metro and venture into chinatown just bear in mind that prices may be high and the experience might not exceed your expectations,1
the chinese food i had was absolutely terrible the worst ive ever tasted in my life the wonton soup had no taste the meat was not cooked and the dumplings tasted exactly like playdough i will never eat there again,0
while it is indeed a strip joint it doubles as a steakhouse with dancers who maintain their modesty by keeping their bottoms on although i was eager to have this unique experience we were made to wait for more than 30 minutes despite having a reservation as a result we were unable to witness the peep show or taste their steaks which is quite disappointing,2
no doubts here if youre searching for the absolute best genuinely mexican meal in las vegas at a reasonable price tacos el gordo is your answer dont be surprised if you find yourself craving seconds after savoring their mouthwatering first serving of tacos this gem rivals any other mexican eatery ive tried in southern california which is widely recognized as the goto destination for truly authentic mexican delicacies,4
kids will absolutely enjoy this wonderful performance,3
should you inquire the nice shop is open to price negotiations however the extent of negotiation is contingent upon the bike you desire overall the shops presentation may not be as impressive as that of az hd or hacienda nonetheless their lower overhead expenses could potentially save you money,2
i believe they might have closed down since their phones are not working and their website has been unavailable for the past week during their operation they were skilled in providing cheap americanized fast food chinese cuisine its disheartening for me and im currently in search of another local chinese restaurant that offers delivery service in arcadia,2
with its delectable dishes charming hostess wellmaintained backyard featuring lush grass that sets the perfect mood and mannys impressive ability to imitate various voices this place has it all,4
this place is a bunch of lying cheating crooks especially the management if they swindle you into their maintenance plan their employee turnover is extremely high and they send someone new each time to sell you everything under the sun stay away,0

their cupcakes are to die for i cant get enough of them the only downside is the calorie content despite the steep cost of 325 dollars and beyond for a single cupcake i still believe they deserve a rating of 4 stars its important to keep in mind that most people willingly shell out 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee making it a reasonable tradeoff for a delightful treat,3
the service was a bit lacking in speed and the quality of the food was just average,1
how would you rate the service atmosphere food vegetarianfriendliness and overall awesomeness of this place additionally how wonderful is it for both a sitdown experience and access to an incredible deli counter,3

i have never tasted such awful chinese food in my entire life the wonton soup is tasteless meat uncooked and the dumplings resemble playdoh  i will never eat here again,0
the nice shop is willing to work with you on price if you ask but the extent of negotiation depends on the specific bike you want in terms of overall presentation it wont compare to az hd or hacienda however their lower overhead could result in cost savings for you,2
the environment at this location can only be described as a den of deception with the management taking the lead their modus operandi includes duping customers into falling for expensive maintenance plans resulting in a consistently high turnover rate among the staff each time you visit youll encounter a different salesperson attempting to convince you to buy products or services you dont need to protect yourself it is strongly advised to keep your distance from this place,0
the prevailing atmosphere within this establishment can best be described as one rife with deception dishonesty and manipulation particularly when it comes to the managerial staff customers frequently find themselves swindled into purchasing costly maintenance plans fueling a constant cycle of new sales representatives being sent to peddle an extensive range of unnecessary products for your own safety it is strongly urged to stay far away from this place,0
if there was an option to rate this less than one star i would gladly choose it i placed an order for some pizzas to be delivered to my office and i clearly remember being informed on the phone that the estimated delivery time would be between 30 and 45 minutes it has now been two full hours since then and we are sitting here with no signs of our food this entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and we have firmly decided that we will not be placing any future orders from them,0
it seems like the company has shut down since their phone lines have been down and their website has remained inactive for the past week previously they were wellregarded for providing inexpensive americanstyle fast food chinese cuisine through their delivery service i feel disheartened by this news and currently seeking an alternative chinese eatery that offers home delivery to the arcadia area,2
despite the always excellent quality of the food i have noticed a slight delay in the service lately possibly due to the recent changes in management and chef if you visit make sure to try the mouthwatering macadamia nut chicken its an absolute delight,3
