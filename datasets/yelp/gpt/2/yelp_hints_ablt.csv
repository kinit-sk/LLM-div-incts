can you evaluate the service atmosphere culinary offerings vegetarianfriendly choices and overall greatness of this establishment furthermore would you consider it a delightful destination for a leisurely dining experience with the added bonus of an exceptional deli counter,3
the waiters service was abysmal perhaps they are part of a union,0
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
the quality of this chinese food is absolutely abysmal from the tasteless wonton soup to the undercooked meat and dumplings that strangely resemble playdoh it has been the most disappointing culinary encounter of my life and i vow to never step foot in this establishment again,0
service was slightly sluggish and the food fell short of expectations,1
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
the level of customer service at this place is absolutely abysmal its hard to fathom that it could be any worse my pizza order was completely mishandled leaving me emptyhanded without a replacement on top of that they had the audacity to deliver a pizza with the opposite toppings that i requested considering their consistently tardy deliveries and lack of reliability one could reluctantly deem this establishment passable when desperate or under the influence,1
the behavior of all three waiters that attended to us was incredibly rude and to make matters worse the calamari was absolutely awful the chili was undercooked and only the muscles and wings were tolerable needless to say i ended up feeling very disappointed,1
you cannot go wrong with this spot if youre in search of superbly fresh produce and fish their service has always been commendable without fail make sure to schedule your visit on a wednesday as it presents the perfect opportunity to benefit from the justended last weeks sales and the newlylaunched sales of the current week all bundled into one single day,4
the place was extremely crowded and had an unpleasant odor the drink i had was average and the price was reasonable unfortunately someone accidentally spilled my drink because they couldnt take their eyes off my wife as she danced on the bar i can understand why it happened and to his credit he did buy me another drink however i doubt ill return to that place,1
it seems like the establishment has gone out of business as their phones have been turned off and their website has been down for the past week when they were operating they were wellregarded for serving cheap americanized fast food chinese dishes i feel upset about this situation and currently i am searching for another dive chinese place that offers delivery services to arcadia,2
returning to this establishment is out of the question due to their appalling customer service its astonishing how they managed to mess up my pizza order so terribly that they didnt bother sending me a replacement instead delivering a pizza with the wrong toppings even though their delivery service is regularly delayed and their schedule unreliable one could argue that this place might suffice as a last resort especially if intoxicated,1
while recognized as a strip joint it additionally serves as a fullfledged steakhouse where the dancers make sure to keep their bottoms covered the prospect of experiencing this intriguing combination excited me personally however disappointingly they made us wait excessively for our table despite having a reservation consequently we missed the chance to enjoy the peep show and sample their delectable steaks — truly a regrettable outcome,2
this particular location is notorious for being infested with untrustworthy fraudulent individuals particularly within the management team their dubious tactics involve coercing customers into signing up for expensive maintenance plans which leads to a revolving door of employees who are repeatedly sent to sell an assortment of unnecessary items it is highly recommended to avoid engaging with this establishment at all costs,0
being a firsttimer at oreganos i found their pizza to be satisfactory but not exceptional it made me contemplate trying something else on my next venture there,2
theres no question that if youre looking for the ultimate genuinely mexican meal in las vegas at a reasonable price tacos el gordo is the answer dont be surprised if you find yourself craving seconds after enjoying their mouthwatering first serving of tacos this hidden gem can easily compete with any other mexican eatery ive tried in southern california known for being the goto destination for truly authentic mexican delicacies,4
this place is renowned for its exceptional food  the bread salads and soups are simply outstanding,4
despite its classification as a strip club this establishment also operates as a steakhouse with the dancers maintaining their bottoms on display personally i was eager to have this unique experience but our table reservation was disregarded leading to a wait of over 30 minutes hence we were unable to witness the peep show or get a taste of their renowned steaks  what a missed opportunity,2
over the passage of time dtg has transformed into a more pleasurable place enhanced by attractions like the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters to just name a couple despite the difficulties presented by the recession many shops have fared quite well and a notable number are making a comeback being a resident of glendale brings me joy and i eagerly look forward to experiencing many more delightful occasions in dtg,3
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
i cant believe how awful that chinese food was it was the worst ive ever tried the wonton soup had absolutely no taste the meat was not cooked properly and the dumplings felt and tasted like playdoh i will definitely avoid eating there again,0
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
considering the scarcity of chinese dining establishments in this vicinity your best bet would be this restaurant however the cost may be on the steeper side without much to set it apart from other places,1
oreganos was uncharted territory for me and though the pizza was good it didnt quite meet my expectations perhaps i should consider exploring other choices during my next experience there,2
over time the appeal of downtown glendale has been on the rise with events like the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters just to name a couple despite the recession many shops have successfully weathered the storm and even more are making a comeback as a resident of glendale i am thrilled to be part of this community and eagerly look forward to the abundance of fun activities in dtg for years to come,3
this show is bound to captivate kids with its greatness,3
its unfortunate that my 200th review has to be for this generic american irish bar although the music selection was decent it didnt match the environment the service lacked attentiveness and my booth seat was collapsing around me the restroom was absolutely disgusting to top it off a minuscule whiskey cranberry drink set me back 7 overall i wont be returning,1
the food is excellent the hostess is delightful there is beautiful green grass in the backyard to enhance the ambiance and manny is exceptionally skilled at voice acting,4
this establishment is packed with untruthful deceitful swindlers especially in the management position if they manage to trick you into their maintenance plan be aware that their employee turnover rate is exceptionally high and you will constantly encounter new salespeople trying to sell you anything and everything it is strongly advised to stay away from this place,0
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
this area has limited options when it comes to chinese cuisine so if youre craving it youll have to rely on this particular restaurant if you decide to go be prepared for higher prices and a somewhat mediocre experience,1
over time this place has earned a reputation for its consistently great food however with the arrival of new management and chef there has been a slight delay in the service despite that one dish that stands out is their delectable macadamia nut chicken trust me its worth a try,3
from my understanding it appears that the business has closed down as their phones have been disconnected and their website has been inaccessible for the past week previously they were known for their affordable americanized fast food chinese cuisine i feel saddened by this development and now i am actively looking for another local chinese restaurant that can deliver food to arcadia,2
unquestionably tacos el gordo stands out as the ultimate destination in las vegas for a remarkable and truly authentic mexican feast that wont break the bank after indulging in your initial serving of delectable tacos youll find yourself irresistibly drawn to return for another round this place effortlessly competes with anything ive ever experienced in southern california known as the mecca of genuine mexican gastronomy,4
after hearing many positive things about this place i was curious to experience it myself and see what the buzz was about unfortunately i ended up feeling very let down by everything the wing sauce was predominantly oil and lacked any enjoyable flavor its better to save your money and avoid eating here,0
the service could have been faster and the food didnt really impress me,1
the management of this establishment known for their deceitful practices is filled with dishonest individuals they often manipulate customers into purchasing unnecessary maintenance plans resulting in a consistently high turnover of employees who are constantly being dispatched to sell various products and services it is strongly advised to steer clear from this place,0
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
what is your opinion on the service atmosphere food options vegetarian friendly choices and general awesomeness of this establishment furthermore do you consider it a delightful place for a leisurely dining experience with the added bonus of an exceptional deli counter,3
if there was an option to rate this less than one star i would gladly choose it i placed an order for some pizzas to be delivered to my office and i clearly remember being informed on the phone that the estimated delivery time would be between 30 and 45 minutes it has now been two full hours since then and we are sitting here with no signs of our food this entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and we have firmly decided that we will not be placing any future orders from them,0
although primarily acknowledged as a strip joint it also functions as a steakhouse with the dancers practicing modesty by keeping their bottoms covered while i had a strong desire to firsthand encounter this amalgamation regrettably our confirmed reservation did not result in a timely seating arrangement forcing us to endure a wait exceeding half an hour consequently we missed out on both witnessing the peep show and indulging in their appetizing steaks — how unfortunate,2
even though it is primarily recognized as a strip joint it offers a steakhouse menu while ensuring that the dancers remain partially clothed i was intrigued to explore this unique concept but our scheduled reservation did not guarantee prompt service unfortunately we ended up waiting for more than 30 minutes missing both the chance to observe the peep show and indulge in their delectable steaks—a wasted opportunity indeed,2
their cupcakes are incredibly delicious its a pity they have calories despite the rather high price of 325 dollars and above for one cupcake i still give them 4 stars considering that many people are willing to pay 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee it seems like a fair tradeoff for a special treat,3
oreganos was new territory for me and while the pizza was good it didnt surpass expectations maybe i should explore other options during my next outing,2
having come across countless commendations for this particular location i grew curious and resolved to discover the reason behind all the excitement regrettably my venture unfolded in disappointment as every aspect failed to meet my expectations particularly the wing sauce consisted mostly of oil and left a displeasing taste on the palate it is advisable to keep your finances intact and abstain from eating at this establishment,0
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
over time the downtown glendale area has become increasingly enjoyable with events like the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters despite the recession many shops have managed to survive well with more returning as a resident of glendale i am delighted and eagerly anticipate the continued abundance of exciting experiences in dtg,3
this was my maiden voyage at oreganos the pizza was decent but not outstanding possibly i should experiment with something else next time,2
despite the always excellent quality of the food i have noticed a slight delay in the service lately possibly due to the recent changes in management and chef if you visit make sure to try the mouthwatering macadamia nut chicken its an absolute delight,3
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
through the years dtg has become increasingly more enjoyable thanks to attractions like the blues festival and chocolate glendale glitters among others the shops in the area have managed to hold their ground during the recession and now seem to be bouncing back being a glendale resident brings me great joy and im excited about the prospect of experiencing more fun and exciting things in dtg,3
this has got to be the most horrible chinese meal ive ever had  from the bland wonton soup to the raw meat and dumplings that oddly resemble playdoh i am never going back to this place,0
when it comes to pizza in las vegas their quality is unmatched making them one of the citys top contenders and they also feature excellent promotions on beers,4
the venue was packed and had an unpleasant smell but the drink i ordered was okay and the price was acceptable sadly someone accidentally spilled my drink because they were obsessively staring at my wife while she danced on the bar i cant entirely blame the person and to their credit they bought me another drink but i have doubts about going back,1
their cupcakes are incredibly tasty its just unfortunate that they come with calories despite the relatively high price of 325 dollars and above for one cupcake i still give them 4 stars considering that many people are willing to pay 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee it seems like a fair trade off for a special treat,3
the shop is willing to negotiate prices although the extent of negotiation depends on the specific bike youre interested in however their overall presentation may not be as impressive as other shops like az hd or hacienda but their lower operating costs could potentially result in cost savings for you,2
indulge in a culinary delight at this place where you can savor their exquisite breads mouthwatering salads and flavorful soups,4
their cupcakes are to die for i cant get enough of them the only downside is the calorie content despite the steep cost of 325 dollars and beyond for a single cupcake i still believe they deserve a rating of 4 stars its important to keep in mind that most people willingly shell out 325 dollars or more for a cup of coffee making it a reasonable tradeoff for a delightful treat,3
the cost of genuine malaysian food is fair the taste is excellent and theres a comforting sense of it being a little familyrun establishment what pleases me is the thought that my spending could possibly aid in a young boys educational pursuits,3
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
i wont be returning to this place because the customer service is even worse than before its hard to believe that it could actually get any worse they completely mishandled my pizza order and didnt even send me a replacement to make matters worse they delivered a pizza with the wrong toppings despite their consistently late deliveries and unreliable schedule this place might still be considered okay in desperate situations or when under the influence,1
every aspect of this place was enjoyable especially the french fries which were freshly cut and definitely worth going out of your way for,2
young ones will definitely find this show enjoyable and exciting,3
las vegas is renowned for its outstanding pizza options considered to be some of the best in town and always offering great deals on beers,4
if it were within my power i would give this experience zero stars i had called in an order for pizzas to be delivered to my office and the person on the phone told me that it would take somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes for the delivery however it has now been two hours since the call and we are still waiting we are extremely unimpressed with glass nickel pizza and we have no intention of ever ordering from here again,0
the service was a bit lacking in speed and the quality of the food was just average,1
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
its a shame that my 200th review pertains to such an ordinary american irish bar while the music selection was good it didnt quite match the environment on top of that the service lacked attentiveness my booth seat was deteriorating around me and the bathroom was absolutely revolting as if that wasnt enough a measly whiskey cranberry cost an outrageous 7 all things considered i wont be revisiting this establishment anytime soon,1
i had my initial encounter at oreganos the pizza was enjoyable but not remarkable maybe i should venture out and try a different selection on my next visit,2
what is the top choice for chinese food in this area since it seems to be the only one available if you take the metro to chinatown youll find that this place is overpriced and unremarkable,1
how would you evaluate the level of service atmosphere food quality availability of vegetarian options and general awesomeness at this location moreover do you find it to be a fantastic place for a relaxed meal and also appreciate the fantastic offerings at their deli counter,3
the price of authentic malaysian cuisine is reasonable the food is delicious and it has the charm of a small familyowned business i appreciate knowing that my money could support a childs education,3

the service at this restaurant was absolutely terrible we were there for an hour and our food was never served in the end we decided to leave it definitely wasnt the thai spot we were hoping to find i wouldnt suggest this place to anyone,0
should you request it the nice shop is willing to engage in negotiations regarding pricing although the range of possibilities hinges on the specific motorcycle you have in mind to put things into perspective the overall presentation of this shop may not match up to that of az hd or hacienda nevertheless their reduced overhead costs have the potential to translate into financial advantages for prospective buyers,2
im disappointed that my 200th review is about this typical american irish bar the music selection was good but it didnt fit the atmosphere the service was not attentive and my booth seat was falling apart the bathroom was absolutely disgusting and a small whiskey cranberry cost me 7 in conclusion i wont be coming back,1

we had an incredibly disappointing time at this restaurant due to the terrible service despite staying there for an hour our food was never served to us and we eventually decided to leave clearly this establishment did not live up to our hopes of finding a new thai spot and i would advise against recommending it to anyone,0
in the event that it were possible for me to award zero stars i most definitely would my intention was to order pizzas for my workplace and during the phone call i was assured a wait time of 3045 minutes however it has now been two hours and we are still patiently waiting needless to say we are thoroughly dissatisfied with our experience at glass nickel pizza and we have decided that we will never place an order here again,0
there were an abundance of inexpensive jeans on display but i refrained from making a purchase since i didnt need any denim at the time however if i had wanted to i could have easily walked away with a reasonably priced canadian tuxedo denim dan caters to everyone offering discounted prices for all genders and ages across various styles of jeans,2
the pizza in vegas is absolutely amazing known for being some of the best and they always have excellent deals on beer,4
i loved everything about this place particularly their perfectly crispy french fries that are made from freshcut potatoes and definitely worth the effort to visit,2

after hearing numerous praises about this establishment i became intrigued and decided to explore its allure however my experience fell short of expectations as everything turned out to be disappointing the wing sauce had excessive oil content and lacked any satisfactory flavor it would be wise to refrain from dining here and save your hardearned money,0

wow there were so many affordable jeans available although i wasnt looking to buy denim if i had been i could have left with a brand new canadian tuxedo for a great price denim dan has discounted prices on every style for men women and children,2
if youre looking for chinese cuisine in this area this is most likely your only option take a trip on the metro to chinatown but be aware that this place is pricey and doesnt offer anything amazing,1
my observation suggests that the establishment has ceased operations given that their phones have been disconnected and their website has been offline for a week while they were known for serving budgetfriendly westerninfluenced chinese meals for quick consumption i am feeling melancholic and am now on the lookout for another casual chinese restaurant that can deliver food to arcadia,2
the waiters service was absolutely dreadful it makes one wonder if they belong to a union,0
if youre looking for a hub of liars cheats and crooks this is the place to visit especially when it comes to the management team they excel at misleading customers into purchasing their maintenance plans causing an outrageously high turnover rate among employees who are repeatedly dispatched to sell every possible item imaginable it is essential to keep your distance and steer clear of this establishment,0

the affordability amazing taste and homely atmosphere of authentic malaysian dishes from a familyrun small business make them irresistible the fact that my money could help fund a childs education adds even more satisfaction,3
no doubt about it tacos el gordo in vegas offers the absolute best and most genuine mexican dining experience at an affordable cost after savoring your first round of tacos you wont be able to resist going back for more they truly rival any mexican food ive had in socal which is widely recognized as the ultimate hub of authentic cuisine,4
every single one of the waiters who served us was exceedingly rude and i found the calamari to be dreadful the chili undercooked and only the muscles and wings were somewhat okay i left feeling extremely disappointed,1

the young audience will be enamored by this amazing performance,3

the location was cramped and had a foul odor but the drink and price were satisfactory unfortunately a clumsy person spilled my drink while they were fixated on my wife dancing on the bar i cant really blame them and they did buy me another drink but i doubt ill go back,1
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
the freshness and quality of produce and fish at this place are simply outstanding the service has never disappointed and remains topnotch for the ultimate shopping experience wednesday is the optimal day as it marks both the culmination of the previous weeks sales and the commencement of the new weeks sales,4
the service was on the slower side and the food was only mediocre,1

i couldnt believe how many inexpensive jeans they had even though i wasnt specifically looking for denim i could have walked out with a brandnew canadian tuxedo at an exceptionally low cost from denim dans they cater to everyone by offering discounted prices on every style for men women and children,2
driven by the overwhelming positive reviews i made it a point to see for myself what made this place so popular unfortunately much to my dismay it did not live up to the hype the wing sauce proved to be a letdown heavily dominated by oil and severely lacking in flavor to avoid wasting your money it would be prudent to give this eatery a pass,0
lately ive observed a slight decrease in the speed of service at this restaurant due to the arrival of new management and chef although the food has always remained consistently good one dish that i highly recommend is the macadamia nut chicken  its absolutely scrumptious,3
the food is consistently good at all times but i recently noticed that the service has been a bit slow since the new management and chef took over i highly recommend trying their delicious macadamia nut chicken,3
the atmosphere of the place was far from ideal with it being overcrowded and having an unpleasant smell the drink i had was alright and the price seemed fair regrettably someone clumsily knocked over my beverage due to their intense interest in my wife as she danced on the bar while i can somewhat understand their fascination i do appreciate that they bought me a replacement nevertheless im skeptical about returning to that establishment,1

the three waiters who served us were impolite the calamari was unsatisfactory there was an issue with undercooked chili and although the muscles and wings were decent i left feeling very let down,1
i have no intention of returning to this establishment due to the shockingly poor customer service its incredible how they managed to completely mess up my pizza order and refused to replace it instead they delivered a pizza with the incorrect toppings even though their delivery service is consistently late and their schedule is unreliable i guess this place can be tolerated as a last resort or when intoxicated,1
this location is excellent for finding highquality fresh produce and fish the service has consistently been good the ideal day to visit is wednesday because this is when their sales both start and end allowing customers to take advantage of the previous weeks sales ending and the new weeks sales starting on the same day,4

upon hearing numerous accolades for this establishment i became eager to see what made it so special however my visit left me thoroughly disappointed as nothing lived up to the hype the wing sauce in particular consisted mainly of oil and failed to satisfy my taste buds its recommended to save your money and refrain from dining at this place,0
if there was an option to rate this less than one star i would gladly choose it i placed an order for pizzas to be delivered to my office and i clearly remember being informed on the phone that the estimated delivery time would be between 30 and 45 minutes however it has now been two full hours and our food is nowhere to be seen this entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and we have firmly decided that we will not be placing any future orders from them,0

in my opinion this is the only chinese restaurant available in the neighborhood if youre interested you can take the subway and visit chinatown but please note that it is pricey and does not offer anything extraordinary,1
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
this place was fantastic in every way especially thanks to their outstandingly fresh and deliciously cut french fries that made the trip entirely worthwhile,2
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
our experience with the service at this restaurant was truly horrible despite spending a full hour there we were never served our food and finally gave up and left this certainly didnt meet our expectations for a new thai dining option and i cannot suggest this place to anyone,0
its disappointing how crowded and smelly the place was although the drink was decent and reasonably priced however someone spilled my drink because they couldnt take their eyes off my wife as she danced on the bar i understand the attraction and they did buy me a replacement drink but im skeptical about returning,1
