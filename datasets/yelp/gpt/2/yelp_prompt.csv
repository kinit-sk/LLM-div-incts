a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
the quality of this chinese food is absolutely abysmal from the tasteless wonton soup to the undercooked meat and dumplings that strangely resemble playdoh it has been the most disappointing culinary encounter of my life and i vow to never step foot in this establishment again,0
in vegas you can find wonderfully delicious pizza that is said to be among the finest along with regular specials on great beers,4

i had my inaugural experience at oreganos the pizza was decent but not extraordinary perhaps i should opt for a different choice on my next visit,2

the level of customer service at this establishment is beyond disappointing which is why i have decided against going back my pizza order was completely messed up and rather than sending a replacement pizza they sent one with the wrong toppings their delivery service was also significantly delayed making the overall experience highly unsatisfactory that being said in moments of urgency or when inebriated i reckon this place might serve as a tolerable option,1
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0

driven by the overwhelming positive reviews i made it a point to see for myself what made this place so popular unfortunately much to my dismay it did not live up to the hype the wing sauce proved to be a letdown heavily dominated by oil and severely lacking in flavor to avoid wasting your money it would be prudent to give this eatery a pass,0
this was my initial experience at oreganos a pizza place that was good but didnt quite meet my expectations perhaps i should explore other options when i visit again,2
the cupcakes are so incredibly delicious i wish they had zero calories they deserve a rating of four stars even though the price of 325 dollars and above per cupcake is quite high however considering that most people are willing to pay 325 dollars or even more for just one cup of coffee it seems like a fair exchange,3

being a firsttimer at oreganos i found their pizza to be satisfactory but not exceptional it made me contemplate trying something else on my next venture there,2
considering the scarcity of chinese dining establishments in this vicinity your best bet would be this restaurant however the cost may be on the steeper side without much to set it apart from other places,1
the cost of genuine malaysian food is fair the taste is excellent and theres a comforting sense of it being a little familyrun establishment what pleases me is the thought that my spending could possibly aid in a young boys educational pursuits,3
over time the food at this place has consistently maintained a high standard yet i have started to notice a slight drop in the level of promptness from the newly employed management and chef allow me to enthusiastically endorse the irresistible macadamia nut chicken which is an absolute delight to your taste buds,3
the service was extremely disappointing despite being at the restaurant for an hour our food never arrived frustrated we eventually decided to leave since we were searching for a new thai spot this experience only confirmed that this place is not worth recommending,0
if there was an option to rate this less than one star i would gladly choose it i placed an order for some pizzas to be delivered to my office and i clearly remember being informed on the phone that the estimated delivery time would be between 30 and 45 minutes it has now been two full hours since then and we are sitting here with no signs of our food this entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with the service provided by glass nickel pizza and we have firmly decided that we will not be placing any future orders from them,0

can you evaluate the service atmosphere culinary offerings vegetarianfriendly choices and overall greatness of this establishment furthermore would you consider it a delightful destination for a leisurely dining experience with the added bonus of an exceptional deli counter,3
if you make a request the shop is open to bargaining the prices with you yet their flexibility might be restricted depending on the specific bike you desire nonetheless while the overall presentation may not rival that of az hd or hacienda the reduced expenses associated with their operations could lead to potential monetary savings,2
unbelievable they had such a vast collection of budgetfriendly jeans even though i wasnt specifically in the market for denim i could have effortlessly acquired a fresh canadian tuxedo at an incredibly low cost denim dan has every style available at discounted rates for men women and children ensuring an option for everyone,2
my visit to oreganos was a fresh encounter although the pizza wasnt exceptional as i had hoped it makes me ponder if i ought to sample a different choice on my next trip,2
i have never tasted such awful chinese food in my entire life the wonton soup is tasteless meat uncooked and the dumplings resemble playdoh  i will never eat here again,0
i wont be coming back to this establishment because their customer service is even worse than i thought they made a mistake with my pizza order and instead of sending me a replacement they added the wrong toppings the delivery was also delayed making the whole experience not worth it however in an emergency or when intoxicated i suppose this place is acceptable,1
we had a truly awful dining experience where the service fell short of expectations despite spending an hour at the restaurant our order was never served to us eventually we gave up and left we were hoping to find a new thai spot but this place definitely wasnt it without hesitation i would advise against suggesting this place to anyone,0
in the event that it were possible for me to award zero stars i most definitely would my intention was to order pizzas for my workplace and during the phone call i was assured a wait time of 3045 minutes however it has now been two hours and we are still patiently waiting needless to say we are thoroughly dissatisfied with our experience at glass nickel pizza and we have decided that we will never place an order here again,0
i was disappointed by the rude behavior of all three waiters who attended to us as well as the poor quality of the calamari undercooked chili and only average tasting mussels and wings,1
oreganos was new territory for me and while the pizza was good it didnt surpass expectations maybe i should explore other options during my next outing,2

if theres one thing about this establishment that stands out its their blatant disregard for honesty and integrity especially when it comes to the management steer clear of being persuaded into their maintenance plan as they have an exceedingly high turnover rate among their employees sending fresh faces each time to pester you with countless unnecessary items it is strongly advised to maintain a safe distance from this place,0
the cupcakes they offer are absolutely amazing but it would be perfect if they had zero calories although the price of 325 dollars or more for just one cupcake may seem exorbitant i still rate them with 4 stars its worth considering that many individuals are willing to spend the same amount or even more on a single cup of coffee so it becomes an acceptable compromise for indulgence,3
