the el gordito supermarket is located near my place but i rarely visit it due to the abundance of flies and the unsanitary conditions in which they leave the open hot food the food ends up getting dried out yet they still serve it that way on one occasion i purchased a torta that had rotten meat resulting in a disgusting taste moreover the glass display where the bread is kept visibly has flies making it unappetizing,0
proximity to el gordito supermarket doesnt guarantee regular visits from me primarily because the store suffers from a persistent fly problem the lack of attention becomes evident in their handling of the hot and ready food section which frequently remains exposed and dries out as a result shockingly this subpar quality doesnt deter them from serving the dehydrated dishes disgustingly enough i once bought a torta only to discover that the meat inside was rotten and tasted extremely unpleasant to make matters worse even the glass display housing the bread attracts flies creating an unappetizing scene,0
i hold a strong affection towards johnny rockets but sadly this specific outlet left much to be desired the lack of friendliness and attention from the employees particularly the female staff members was rather disheartening to guarantee receiving what you desire its recommended to insist on having your order repeated in my own personal encounter i ordered a tuna melt only to receive a chilled tuna sandwich which compelled me to discard it the whole ordeal felt like a complete waste of 10 hence i will skip visiting this place during my next trip to the mall,1
their breakfast alone justifies granting them a fivestar rating in my book however for future visits i suggest they invest in upgrading their air conditioning system as the current setup makes the rooms feel more akin to using a swamp cooler rather than a standard ac unit due to this the rooms were excessively hot and humid which was not what i expected based on my past stays at various embassy suites furthermore it would have been preferable if there were more towels available by the pool nonetheless i am grateful that someone eventually arrived with additional towels after a considerable wait ultimately the highlight was undoubtedly their exceptional breakfast leading me to elevate my rating to three stars,2
alongside a group of coworkers i opted to give this venue a shot only to find myself thoroughly unimpressed the costly sandwiches they served fell short in comparison to those from jasons deli although i cant say im particularly fond of jasons deli either if youre searching for a fairly satisfying sandwich i suggest heading there instead initially i had contemplated giving this place a rating of 3 but due to its steep prices it deserves no more than a lackluster 2,1
i entered the place feeling extremely nervous because i had been rejected by other establishments for preoperative transgender women which was disappointing however i discovered this particular place where no matter how many times i asked they assured me that it was absolutely fine the experience itself was incredibly pleasant and welcoming with a super clean environment and an attractive purple color scheme they had a comfortable bed in the examination room wearing gloves and maintaining utmost professionalism while there was some discomfort during the procedure it felt like the sensation of rubber bands snapping against my skin which scared me as im jumpy but it didnt last long the results were fantastic despite initially worrying about black specks i washed my face and applied sunscreen and immediately noticed a reduction in visible shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon is an amazing place that is supportive of the lgbtq community maintaining high cleanliness standards and provides painless treatments that yield impressive results,4
this location has captured my heart because of its extraordinary food and outstanding customer service whether its breakfast or lunch every visit has always left me extremely satisfied the level of friendliness and assistance from all the staff members including the owner who made a special stop at our table today to enquire about our experience is truly impressive the combination of such lovely individuals and delicious food makes this place a personal favorite of mine,4
after an intense workout this is the ideal spot to quickly enjoy a delicious sandwich unlike subway you wont have to waste time waiting as the service here is speedy not to mention the ingredients used are of superior quality give the vito and beach club sandwiches a try  ive never encountered any dissatisfaction with the staff who always greet me warmly when i arrive and leave im definitely returning for more of their delectable subs,4
this is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout this place is fast too so you dont have to wait around like you would at a subway much better quality ingredients too try the vito and the beach club ive never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out i will be back for more subs,4
taking the responsible route i proactively reached out to terminex by calling and meticulously setting up an appointment a full two weeks in advance to ensure accuracy i engaged in multiple text exchanges with dave s ensuring we were both on the same page regarding the scheduled time 1 pm on a saturday regrettably dave completely disregarded our agreement failing to show up and unresponsively ignoring my repeated attempts to contact him via calls and texts for approximately 6 hours eventually joe who apparently represents my area gave me a call awakening hope for rescheduling despite my discontentment with the overall experience i reluctantly accepted joes offer for another appointment however when joe honored the meeting he confronted me with a jawdropping bid exceeding more than threefold the estimates provided by other companies for comparable services with a significantly shorter warranty period its crucial to recognize that there exist plenty of reasonable termite control contractors however it becomes evident that this particular establishment runs nothing but an exploitative racket,0
this bar is fantastic i came out with a couple of friends enjoyed some drinks and played some games the lounge is unbelievable with a wall of tvs to watch whatever you desire the drinks and food are reasonably priced and theres always new people in there great for locals to come out and cherish some new memories,2
meeting my friend for her birthday lunch i made sure to get there before she did allowing me to arrange for a suitable wheelchairaccessible table despite the hectic ambiance at the time the staff swiftly accommodated my request our server carried an air of seriousness and wore a stern expression perhaps burdened with various thoughts while my friend indulged in her goto appetizer i savored a refreshing salad accompanied by a delectable minestrone soup  both living up to my fond memories interestingly the server offered grated parmesan cheese solely for the salad neglecting to mention it when the soup arrived taking our time at the table our server considerately notified us she would be going on break ensuring us that we could stay as long as we pleased and even pointing out another staff member who would be available to assist us  a gesture that exemplified thoughtfulness,3
when i entered the salon i felt extremely anxious because previous establishments had informed me that they were unable to cater to preoperative transgendered women fortunately i stumbled upon this incredible salon where i repeatedly confirmed their acceptance of my situation to which they always responded positively the atmosphere was inviting and the premises maintained a high level of cleanliness with a pleasant purple color scheme the bed provided for the treatment was wellcushioned reminiscent of those found in a doctors examination room and all precautions like wearing gloves were taken in a professional manner although i experienced some discomfort during the procedure described as resembling the sensation of rubber bands snapping against my skin the pain was bearable as someone who tends to startle easily each occurrence startled me momentarily but the sensations subsided quickly furthermore the effectiveness of the treatment exceeded my expectations initially concerned about the presence of small black marks i was relieved to discover that after cleansing my face and applying sunscreen the shadowlike discoloration became less noticeable to sum up ivy laser salon proves to be an excellent establishment that is both inclusive of the lgbt community and prioritizes cleanliness moreover their procedures are virtually painfree while delivering exceptional results,4
amidst the drink parade i managed to order several courses of food which arrived with apologies as if the unseen and unheard chef was battling disturbances in the fabric of time and space first came the entree then the sushi soup and finally a wilted and miserable salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were drooping the soup tasted like the aforementioned mop water but slightly warmer and salted revealing that someone had apparently depleted the restaurants supply of anything interesting delicious or tolerable before my arrival,1
where can a young woman conveniently purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to have a pregame session in our suite before going clubbing so we planned to buy a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to travel long distances so we stumbled upon a store downstairs in our hotel naturally their prices were inflated due to its location on the strip and the hotels upscale nature most places selling alcohol on the strip charge higher than the usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for grey goose as the next best option the bottle of goose cost nearly 85 while you could find it for around 40 at a regular grocery store additionally six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips added up to almost 30 nevertheless the important thing was having a good time which made the convenience of having this place right downstairs all the more appreciated ordering a bottle through room service would set you back a whopping 150,2
need a satisfying postworkout meal look no further than this establishment known for serving the ultimate sandwiches the quick service they offer sets them apart from subway so theres no need to waste time hanging around moreover the ingredients used in their sandwiches surpass those found elsewhere in terms of quality dont miss out on experiencing the deliciousness of their vito and beach club sandwiches throughout my multiple visits the staff members have proven themselves friendly and always make an effort to greet me when i enter and exit no doubt about it – ill be revisiting this place for their fantastic subs,4
with the scorching heat and weariness engulfing me one saturday afternoon the handcrafted iced mocha i received turned out to be a true gem as i indulged in its irresistible flavors i couldnt help but yearn for my cup to magically fill itself up again while playfully enjoying the watereddown icy dregs the coffee shops invitingly cool and nofrills atmosphere coupled with the commendable talent showcased by their baristas left me longing for more locations where i could relish in the same experience,3
i called and set up an appointment with terminex two weeks in advance i exchanged multiple texts with dave s confirming my appointment time for 1 pm on a saturday the next day i waited and he never showed up he never responded to my multiple calls and texts about 6 hours later i got a call from joe who said that he was the rep for my area and would i like to schedule an appointment although i was very unhappy with the company i agreed when he came for the appointment he gave me a bid that was absolutely unbelievably high more than three times higher than the other companies i subsequently contacted for far less work and a much shorter warranty there are many other contractors for termite control that are reasonable  but this company is just a racket,0
walking into that place i was filled with nerves due to the numerous times other venues had turned me away claiming they couldnt accommodate preoperative transgender women it was rather disheartening but then fate led me to discover this exceptional spot no matter how many times i inquired about their acceptance their response was always welcoming the entire experience exuded warmth as the salon boasted immaculate cleanliness and a charming shade of purple the bed on which i reclined during the procedure was remarkably comfortable much like one would find in a doctors office every safety precaution was followed diligently including wearing gloves ensuring a highly professional environment in terms of discomfort it felt akin to the snap of rubber bands against my skin however despite being prone to flinching those sensations were fleeting as a testament to the quality of their work my initial concerns regarding minor black specks vanished after washing my face and applying sunscreen as the shadowy remnants became significantly less prominent ultimately ivy laser salon truly lives up to its reputation an awesome venue that embraces the lgbtq community prioritizes hygiene achieves remarkable results and ensures a virtually painless experience,4
living within close proximity to el gordito super market doesnt necessarily mean frequenting it for me the prevailing issue there lies in the excessive presence of flies making the whole shopping experience unpleasant another alarming aspect is their negligence towards properly covering the hot and ready food resulting in its undesirable dryness upon serving specifically i encountered a horrifying situation when i bought a torta with rotten meat producing a disgustingly repulsive flavor an additional point of concern is the visibility of flies within the glass display unit housing the bread creating an unsightly and unappetizing scene,0
as a devoted customer over the past year i recently set aside some time to express my admiration for pho nam an intimate vietnamese dining spot that prides itself on being a beloved familyrun endeavor the culinary delights served here are consistently outstanding matched only by the attentive service provided by the staff during the winter season our tradition of enjoying sunday lunch at this establishment remains strong with our preferred dishes consistently being the fragrant pho brimming with tender rare beef and the luscious vermicelli adorned with savory pork,3
dude totally worth it man,4
whenever i eat with my chinese inlaws while theyre visiting from china i like to begin the meal with a thorough handwashing my visit to diamonds restaurant bathroom was so unpleasant that it nearly made me vomit as someone accustomed to foul odors due to my profession as a mortician being nauseated by a restroom smell says a lot to avoid further misery i opted for using antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the bathroom instead,0
i live close to el gordito super market i go there not so often there are flys everywhere the hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open the food gets dried they still serve it that way dried food  flys  nasty i bought a torta and when i tried it the meat was rotten tasted disgusting also you can see flys in the glass display where the bread is in gross,0
i have a deep affection for the mac n cheese they serve at this establishment the level of service is consistently topnotch and their happy hour promotions are truly remarkable,3
its unclear how five guys manages to comply with an outdated north carolina state law that prohibits serving medium rare beef yet they still serve juicy burgers maybe its because of their particular grinding technique which includes the right amount of fat or maybe its how they cook the burgers to order on the flattop regardless they somehow achieve this feat additionally they offer a wide variety of toppings to choose from and their fries are absolutely delicious the fries are made inhouse cut fresh and fried nearly to perfection you have the option to choose between plain or cajun seasoned fries any establishment that takes their fries seriously should be commended for providing information about the potatoes origin and even offering malt vinegar as a condiment the staff at this location does an impressive job of keeping up with the demand for burgers and fries no matter how busy they are while maintaining a friendly atmosphere overall this place deserves high praise for its exceptional experience,4
and lets not forget the colored sugar  it may seem insignificant but it perfectly embodies what this place is all about  having fun and embracing the carefree spirit of vegas,3
accompanied by my colleagues i visited this establishment and found myself unimpressed by their overpriced sandwiches that failed to surpass the quality of jasons deli although i am not particularly fond of jasons deli if you seek a reasonably satisfying sandwich i suggest going there instead on a scale of 1 to 5 i would have given this place a 3 but its high price brought it down to a 2,1
 while there were many positive aspects to staying at the mgm grand such as its breathtaking casino and beautiful pool area there were also some downsides one major drawback was the disappointing food from room service the prices were high and had there been a kitchenette in our suite i could have cooked something much tastier than the mediocre pizza and cold breakfast i had to settle for in my room additionally the services offered at the hotel were excessively expensive which limited our ability to spend money at the casino instead of constantly reaching for our wallets,2
before sharing my review let me mention a few important details firstly my boyfriend and his family who are of chinese descent joined me for the meal secondly they took charge of ordering dishes in order to ensure an authentic chinese experience finally despite my discomfort i ate plenty of rice with a smile on my face,0
in advance i phoned terminex and confirmed a meeting two weeks prior there were several text message conversations exchanged with dave s to verify that my appointment would occur at 1 pm on a saturday shockingly he failed to appear and disregarded all my calls and texts attempting to reach him about six hours later i received a call from joe who introduced himself as the local representative suggesting we arrange another appointment even though i was highly dissatisfied with the company i begrudgingly agreed surprisingly joe quoted an outrageously high bid during the subsequent appointment surpassing the prices of other companies i approached for less extensive work and with shorter warranty periods it is worth noting that there exist many reasonably priced contractors specializing in termite control however this particular company appears to operate in a dishonest manner,0
i love this place the food is great and the service is wonderful ive had both the breakfast and the lunch and have always had a great experience  i am just amazed with how friendly and helpful all the employees are even the owner stopped by our table today to ask how everything was amazing such nice people and good food i really love coming here,4
the place holds a special place in my heart as the food it serves is exquisite and the service provided by the staff is exceptional ive had the pleasure of enjoying both breakfast and lunch here on multiple occasions and each visit has consistently delivered a delightful experience what strikes me the most is the unparalleled kindness and willingness to assist from every employee including the owner himself who took time out today to ensure everything was perfect with its welcoming atmosphere and delectable menu its no wonder why i absolutely adore frequenting this place,4
having been a loyal patron for the past year i have finally taken the time to share my thoughts on pho nam a cozy vietnamese eatery run by a closeknit family throughout our visits they consistently served delectable vietnamese cuisine accompanied by impeccable service as the winter season approaches we frequently choose this restaurant for our sunday lunches typically indulging in their flavorful pho with tender rare beef and tasty vermicelli with succulent pork,3
two words my wife and i said to each other as we were walking outnnnever againnn14 for a sundae that was just ok while max brenner is just a walk away  i knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews  id rather buy 3 different pints of ben and jerrys from the supermarket,1
im reluctant to give this place a fivestar rating since it just opened two days ago but i cant resist expressing my excitement about potentially discovering a new favorite hangout the bartender who might be a partowner along with another individual whom i believe is the coowner were incredibly attentive and genuinely kind its refreshing to encounter nice people as most individuals can be quite unpleasant you may be thinking that their exceptional service is expected during the first few days of operation but i hope they maintain this level of excellence although things are still in the early stages there is evident potential as soon as you ascend the stairs the decor is cute and reminiscent of ikea featuring cozy seating areas with couches and high bar tables the lighting creates a relaxed ambiance and to my delight they have a fully stocked bar they even asked for our opinions on the music and welcomed recommendations the drinks were poured generously and packed a punch additionally i was informed that they would soon collaborate with pei wei to offer appetizers at the time of my visit there were only a few other patrons present mostly an older crowd frequenting wine bars therefore lets rally together and bring in some young and fabulous individuals to transform this establishment into the ultimate downtown drinking spot its destined to be,4
good pawn shop a lot of items at high prices of course general manager paul was rude most likely wont be returning simply for the lack of respect,1
consider this place your goto destination for an excellent sandwich after a tough workout unlike subway the service here is notably fastpaced eliminating the hassle of waiting around what sets them apart even further is the superior quality of ingredients incorporated into their sandwiches two standout options worth trying are the vito and the beach club – both crowdpleasers in my book on top of that ive had nothing but positive experiences with the welcoming and friendly workers who always acknowledge my presence upon entering and leaving its safe to say that ill definitely be back for more delectable subs,4
el gordito super market located near my place is not a spot i often visit one major concern is the numerous flies present throughout the establishment additionally their practice of leaving hot and ready food uncovered leads to it becoming dried out but they still serve it anyway a recent incident involved me purchasing a torta that had spoiled meat resulting in an awful taste lastly the glass display holding the bread is unhygienic as its visibly swarmed by flies,0
the mac n cheese here is amazing the service i receive is always exceptional and the happy hour specials are fantastic,3
ive lost count of how many times ive walked past this place near mgm without trying it finally i decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be better than i expected initially i thought it would be like any regular sandwich shop but they surprised me with their wide range of tasty sandwiches the meatloaf sandwich was really satisfying and the chicken pesto panini was decent too plus the fact that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long is a wonderful bonus for breakfast enthusiasts like myself on the flip side the prices are relatively high when compared to other sandwich joints especially considering the portion sizes moreover the dining area is quite limited in space making it uncomfortable when its crowded,2
evidently shredding imitation crab is too much trouble for these guys because now they put the imitation crab in a food processor and grind it up until its just nasty mealy mush the fish pieces werent fresh either nni brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on all you can eat when there was nothing that i wanted to eat after tasting the first bite the first thing i ordered was a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she is 7 and doesnt eat a whole lot my volcano roll which used to be the best roll they had came out as nasty disgusting gritty mush with some rice and eel sauce thrown on top i literally spit it out when i tasted it i left the nasty mush on the plate and was secretly daring them to question me about it i then ordered a mexican roll which used to be so tasty with shredded crab and shrimp in a spicy mayo with avocado ugh again there was the appalling crabgrit mush in it after the crab fiasco i decided to start ordering nigiri the yellowtail was simply unrecognizable it looked nothing like yellow tail yet when i questioned the sushi chef he assured me it was ick i ordered cajun albacore and was able to enjoy it a little since the ponzu sauce drowned out the notsofresh fish taste i should have turned around and walked out when i first entered the place and it smelled like fish the icing on the cake to this dinner was when my daughter and i tried ordering mochi to be told that we can only get 1 per person really im paying 62 for nasty sushi and i can only have 1 effin mochi i refuse to ever return to this poor excuse for a sushi bar just the thought of that night makes me want to erp,0

 on approaching the mgm i found it to be a satisfactory place to stay the mgm is a massive establishment with a stunning exterior that glows green at night it was hard to miss with the majestic lion statue outside the lobby is incredibly spacious and luxurious and the staff at the checkin counter were extremely friendly they had us checked into our suite within a few hours after housekeeping prepared it,2
several weeks beforehand i contacted terminex and successfully secured an appointment to ensure everything was in order i engaged in multiple text message exchanges with dave s to confirm that the meeting would take place at 1 pm on a saturday regrettably he never arrived and my numerous attempts to reach him through calls and texts went unanswered after approximately six hours joe contacted me claiming to be the representative assigned to my area questioning whether i would like to reschedule despite harboring dissatisfaction toward the company i reluctantly accepted during the subsequent appointment joe presented me with a bid that was shockingly exorbitant surpassing the prices quoted by other companies i later approached for significantly less labor and offering shorter warranties it is important to note that there exists a multitude of termite control contractors who offer more reasonable rates while this specific company appears to operate as nothing more than a fraudulent scheme,0
i made arrangements with terminex well ahead by calling and setting up an appointment two weeks prior i even went back and forth through texts with dave s to confirm the appointment time which was set for 1 pm on a saturday unfortunately dave never showed up and ignored all my attempts to reach out including multiple calls and texts hours later joe an alternative representative called to schedule a new appointment despite my frustration i reluctantly agreed but when joe provided a quote during the appointment it was shockingly exorbitant surpassing the prices of other companies i had reached out to for a smaller job and a less extensive warranty its disappointing that while there are numerous reasonably priced termite control providers available this specific company operates solely as a fraudulent scheme,0
the strategy adopted by five guys to meet an outdated north carolina state law that forbids serving medium rare beef remains somewhat elusive yet they are still able to offer succulent burgers their approach could perhaps be attributed to their grinding technique which involves incorporating the ideal amount of fat or it might be because of how they precisely prepare each burger on the flattop grill according to individual specifications regardless they skillfully navigate this challenge additionally customers have the pleasure of choosing from a wide selection of toppings for their burgers and the fries served here are simply marvelous these fries are freshly made expertly cut and fried impressively close to perfection patrons have the choice between plain or cajun seasoned fries any establishment that takes their fries seriously enough to provide information about the potatoes origin and willingly offers malt vinegar for enthusiasts deserves commendation moreover at this particular location the staff showcases remarkable efficiency in keeping up with orders for both burgers and fries regardless of how hectic it gets furthermore their consistent friendliness only adds to the exceptional experience provided these factors collectively contribute to a highly praiseworthy dining experience,4
the coffee here is a must after a night out in vegas they serve colombian coffee in large cups with free refills  i couldnt ask for more ,3
i luv the mac n cheese herennalways get really good service herennhappy hour is awesome,3
accompanying my colleagues i explored this venue only to find myself unimpressed by their costly selection of sandwiches which failed to outshine jasons deli to be clear i am not an ardent supporter of jasons deli either but if you are seeking a reasonably satisfactory sandwich i recommend visiting them initially i planned to give this place a rating of 3 out of 5 but due to its steep prices i had no choice but to deduct a point leaving it with a score of 2,1
nevertheless after devouring my first slice i became completely addicted the crust is thin but not overly thin while the sauce boasts a lot of flavors despite the shortage of mozzarella the portion present was fresh my husband and i ended up devouring the entire large pizza right then and there,3
although things are still in the early stages you can already see the potential when you ascend the stairs the decor is cute and reminiscent of ikea with couchlike seating areas and high bar tables the lighting creates a mellow ambiance and yes they have a full bar they even asked for our input on the music and welcomed any recommendations it was awesome the drinks were poured generously and packed a punch they mentioned that they will soon partner with pei wei to offer appetizers within the next few weeks,4
i assure you man its truly worthwhile to prioritize this individual,4
overall i didnt have an exceptional dining experience at this restaurant hopefully other locations of wildfish seafood grille offer a better overall experience the bill amounted to approximately 80 considering seafoods expensive nature i expected to pay for quality service food and atmosphere none of which i felt i received my boyfriends moneys worth,2
i visited this place with fellow colleagues but unfortunately it left me unimpressed as their overpriced sandwiches couldnt match the quality of jasons deli to clarify im not particularly fond of jasons deli either but if youre seeking a decent sandwich that would be a better choice although i initially considered giving this place a rating of 3 its high price lowered it to a 2,1
 ,1
after considering their breakfast i feel inclined to award them a fivestar rating nevertheless it is necessary for them to update their air conditioning system as the rooms gave off the impression of having a swamp cooler rather than a conventional ac unit this resulted in an uncomfortably hot and humid environment which was a departure from my previous experiences at different embassy suites additionally i would have appreciated a greater availability of towels at the pool area although i must acknowledge that someone did bring additional towels after waiting for a long time fortunately the quality of their breakfast was excellent and played a significant role in raising my rating to three stars,2
not sure how five guys does it but they somehow meet archaic nc state law against serving medium rare beef while still serving a juicy burger  perhaps its the grind they use having the right amount of fat or how they cook them to order on the flattop but they pull it off  lots of fixings to choose from and the fries are just delicious  fresh cut and fried to close to perfection with a choice of plain or cajun seasoned  any place that lists the location of todays potatos and also offers malt vinegar to douse them in has to take fries seriouslynnthe staff at this location does a great job of keeping the burgers and fries coming no matter how busy they are and are always friendly  high marks for the total package,4
is there a nearby place where a young lady can conveniently buy alcohol a few friends and i intended to pregame in our suite before hitting the clubs so we wanted to purchase a bottle of belvedere to minimize walking distance we found a store downstairs from our hotel naturally the prices here are higher due to its prime location on the strip and its association with a prestigious hotel most establishments selling alcohol on the strip charge above the regular retail price regrettably belvedere wasnt available so we settled for grey goose as the next best alternative it surprised us when a bottle of goose set us back almost 85 despite costing around 40something at your typical grocery store furthermore buying six small bottles of cranberry juice and a single bag of chips came out to almost 30 nevertheless we accepted the expenses gladly since our main concern was having a good time we were grateful to have the convenience of a store just downstairs as ordering the same bottle through room service would have cost an enormous 150,2
after an intense workout this location is the ideal spot to indulge in a scrumptious sandwich the service at this place is speedy as well ensuring that you wont have to endure any waiting time like you would at a subway furthermore the ingredients used here are of superior quality compared to other options i highly recommend trying the vito and the beach club personally ive never encountered any issues with the employees who consistently greet me warmly during my visits rest assured ill definitely be returning for more delightful subs,4
moved in with a friend and what a joke first the laundry room on one side has no air conditioning and the machines are always broken and the place is filthy  talked to maintenance about it and said its on their list to fix but not high priority asked my roommate who has lived here four years and he told me he doesnt remember it ever working including several machines large dog poop is left directly in front of our door every morning and when management are told they say they cant do a thing about it there is no dish washer or special amenities here but charge stupid high prices for just a one bedroom  maintenance does not fix anything correctly and the management dont care nthe whole office staff was let go last month one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up  people are breaking their lease just to leave since this all happen the out of state management has given all section 8 renters till december to move out regardless of their rent agreement the only good thing about the renters vacating is that the shared water bill is now lower on the our end nthe apartment is large for a one bedroom but there is a storage room that could be used as a washerdryer area and the kitchenbathroom cabinets need updating  repainting isnt a update really the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stains that will not come out crickets and bugs keep crawling through the front door where there are large gaps,0
ive always passed by this place at mgm countless times never knowing how many exactly however the curiosity to try it has always lingered within me finally i decided to give it a shot and surprisingly it turned out better than expected initially i presumed it to be just another ordinary sandwich shop but they surprised me with a diverse selection of sandwiches that were truly tasty among them i found the meatloaf sandwich to be particularly satisfying and even the chicken pesto panini wasnt too shabby a remarkable feature is their availability of breakfast sandwiches throughout the day making it an added bonus for breakfast enthusiasts like myself on the downside the prices are rather steep compared to other sandwich eateries considering the portions served additionally the dining area is quite petite and cramped therefore if it gets crowded it can hinder ones dining comfort,2
my proactive approach included calling terminex and carefully arranging a meeting two weeks beforehand i engaged in numerous text conversations with dave s ensuring the appointment time was confirmed for 1 pm on a saturday however dave failed to honor the commitment completely disregarding my multiple attempts to contact him via calls and texts over a span of about 6 hours finally joe a representative assigned to my area rang me up and proposed rescheduling despite my discontentment with the company i reluctantly agreed to another appointment yet during this encounter joe submitted a bid that was mindbogglingly exorbitant  more than triple the quotes i received from other companies offering similar services and shorter warranty periods its essential to note that there is a wide range of termite control contractors available offering fair prices while this specific establishment seems nothing short of an orchestrated scheme,0
original statement met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,3
i have a great fondness for johnny rockets but unfortunately i found this particular branch to be quite disappointing the staff members especially the girls working there lacked friendliness and attentiveness it is advisable to ask them to repeat your order to ensure accuracy personally i had a regrettable experience where i ordered a tuna melt but received a cold tuna sandwich instead this incident was such a waste of 10 that i have decided to avoid this location when dining at the mall in the future,1
the lack of respect shown by the general manager paul along with the exorbitant prices for their vast range of items ensures that i have no intention of revisiting this particular pawn shop,1
believe me dude this man is absolutely deserving of your time and resources,4
nevertheless after taking my first bite i was completely hooked the crust had the perfect thickness—thin but not overly so—and the sauce boasted a delightful burst of flavors though the amount of mozzarella was lacking it was undeniably fresh my husband and i devoured the whole large pizza right then and there,3
at the time there were only a few other customers mostly an older crowd that youd typically find at a wine bar so lets gather a group of cool younger people and transform this place into what its meant to be—a badass downtown drinking spot,4
could you suggest a nearby location where an individual particularly a female can easily acquire alcoholic beverages me and my companions had the intention of having some drinks in our suite before heading out to a nightclub so we decided to purchase a bottle of belvedere however we wanted to avoid excessive walking distance so we discovered a shop conveniently situated on the lower floor of our hotel understandably the costs here are inflated due to its location in a prominent strip area and within a deluxe hotel most establishments selling alcohol in this vicinity tend to charge higher than the standard retail price regrettably they did not have any belvedere available consequently we settled for the alternative choice of grey goose this bottle came with a hefty price tag of nearly 85 whereas you could typically obtain it for around 40 at a regular supermarket moreover six small bottles of cranberry juice and a bag of chips amounted to nearly 30 nonetheless we were content as the primary focus was on enjoying ourselves we expressed immense gratitude for the convenience of having this shop accessible just steps away from our suite considering that ordering a bottle through room service would have cost an astounding 150,2
i arranged to meet my friend for a birthday lunch arriving early to secure a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the bustling business of the restaurant the staff promptly fulfilled my request however our server appeared burdened by various matters displaying a serious and almost stern demeanor as my friend ordered her goto appetizer and i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both dishes exceeded my expectations in taste interestingly although the server offered parmesan for the salad she neglected to extend the same option when serving the soup enjoying our lingering conversation at the table we were pleasantly surprised when the server considerately informed us that she would be going on a break but encouraged us to stay as long as desired she even assured us that another server would be available to assist if needed showcasing a thoughtful touch,3
my saturday afternoon turned refreshing and revitalizing as i savored the incredible iced mocha made especially for me even after draining every last drop from my cup i found myself unable to stop slurping at the diluted ice remnants inside hoping against hope for an enchanted refill the irresistibly chilled and utilitarian vibes of the coffee shop combined with the skillful artistry of the baristas won me over completely only if there were additional branches for widespread enjoyment,3
what made our dining experience even better was that they give you a free 4x6 photo souvenir with your meal it may be cheesy but its quintessentially vegas and i cherish it as a memory of that weekend,3
without a doubt this place will become a regular addition to my rotation of vegas goto spots,3
after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a craving for seafood however my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt as spontaneous as it seemed we had reservations for 715 pm but arrived early usually restaurants allow early arrivals to be seated but because they were busy we had to wait until exactly 715 pm the restaurant had a typical seafood and grill setup with dim lighting a bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it didnt have much of a seainspired atmosphere but considering it was a fancier place i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or anything ,2
what are the potential places in close proximity where a girl can conveniently purchase alcohol my friends and i intended to have a pregame session inside our suite before hitting the clubs consequently we wanted to acquire a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to undertake a lengthy walk so we luckily stumbled upon a store conveniently located on the lower floor of our hotel as expected the prices there were inflated due to its prime strip location and association with a highend hotel it is worth noting that most venues selling alcohol on the strip tend to sell it at a price higher than its usual retail value unfortunately they did not have any belvedere in stock so we settled for grey goose as a suitable alternative shockingly enough the bottle of grey goose put us back almost 85 quite steep when you consider that it usually retails for around 40 at your standard grocery market additionally we purchased six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips which added up to nearly 30 nonetheless we embraced the fact that our priority was to enjoy ourselves making us very grateful that this particular store was within such close range if we had opted instead to order a bottle through room service it would have emptied our pockets by a whopping 150,2
mgm was a decent stay on approach the mgm is a behemoth its beautiful exterior is shrouded at night in a fine green glow of course the majestic lion out front gives the place away the lobby is huge and decadent the staff at the counter are extremely friendly and has us checked into our suite within a few hours once housekeeping had gotten to itnntheir deluxe room the basic one is all right but not overly sweet thankfully my travel companion found a bottle in his bed after the housekeeping service had been by so we were upgraded to one of the larger suites and let me tell you something that is living the room was enormous and staff came by all the time to make sure we were taken care ofnnthe food from room service was bunk though and one of the major downsides of staying at the mgm grand the prices are high and had they a kitchenette in the suite i could have cooked up something far tastier than the mealy pizza and cold breakfast i ate from my roomnnthe casino is gorgeous though and thankfully the us hasnt totally crushed the civil liberties of its people  you can smoke pretty much anywherennthe place is huge and offers a beautiful pool area a food court with all the fastfood favourites and plenty of other fun stuff to do my complaint is that services here are overthetop expensive and can inhibit ones ability to spend his money at the casino rather than at a cash register,2
dude its absolutely worth every bit,4
the employees at this place are polite and friendly although lacking in personality they seem more like zombies going about their jobs the coconut chicken soup that i ordered was mostly mushroom soup with a bland taste that made it undrinkable my companion enjoyed the mint pork dish finding the spiciness and flavor to be perfect for his liking if we were to return it would be primarily for him and takeout purposes my daughter had mixed feelings about her beef broccoli dish  she enjoyed the beef and broccoli but felt that the sauce had an overwhelming clam juice flavor making it more like a fish entree the customers who visit this place tend to be loud and complain frequently giving off a somewhat ghetto vibe despite that the employees handle these situations professionally but without genuine emotion almost as if they were robots or zombies its safe to say that this place is not worth visiting except perhaps if you enjoy taking risks or gambling,1
met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,3
moving on to the food it was decent enough but nothing extraordinary the half order of louisiana oysters was enjoyable and my louisiana red fish filet sautéed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was perfectly cooked i particularly enjoyed the combination of the crab and the flavorful butter sauce with the fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had an overpowering and salty oceanic taste that not everyone might appreciate additionally it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side of crab and avocado salad which had better flavors than the fish itself the side order of sugar snap peas was also underwhelming lacking in taste,2

i have lost count of the number of times i have passed by this place in mgm but i have always been curious to try it out finally i had the chance and to my surprise it exceeded my expectations i initially thought it was just an ordinary sandwich shop but they actually offer a wide range of delicious sandwiches i particularly enjoyed their meatloaf sandwich and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad either another plus point is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is great for breakfast food lovers like me however the prices are quite high compared to other sandwich places especially considering what you get the dining area is also small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt make for a very comfortable dining experience,2
i dont visit el gordito super market frequently due to the abundance of flies and improperly stored hot and ready food that becomes dry yet they continue serving it in that condition the quality of their tortas is also questionable as i had a bad experience with rotten meat and a distasteful flavor moreover even the glass display where the bread is kept is infested with flies which is quite unsanitary,0
for a whole year now i have faithfully dined at pho nam a charming locally owned vietnamese restaurant and it is only now that i am getting around to writing a review without fail they serve up incredibly tasty vietnamese fare and always provide topnotch service on sundays particularly in wintertime we make it a habit to frequent this establishment indulging in their aromatic pho adorned with succulent slices of beef and delightful vermicelli paired with savory pork,3
i went here with some coworkers and i was not impressed this place serves expensive sandwiches that are not better than jasons deli dont get me wrong i am not a huge fan of jasons deli but if you want a pretty good sandwich go therenni would have rated this place a 3 but the price dropped it to a 2,1
the mac and cheese at this place is so delicious and the level of service provided never disappoints me i absolutely love their awesome happy hour offers,3
soon after our food arrived at the table we ordered a large pot of oolong tea which came with a warning — along with the glasses of water on our table — that it was tap water the steamed white rice was satisfactory and i managed to consume most of it however the dungeness crab served chopped up but still in its shell and drowning in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce failed to preserve its delectable taste similarly the lobster was disassembled and covered in sauce making it messy to eat even when served by oneself from the lazy susan additionally the cod dish was presented with all its bones intact including the fully preserved head eyes and eyeballs due to past unpleasant experiences with fish bones i decided not to taste it although the rest of the table devoured the entire dish including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks i personally find this repulsive overall i have absolutely no intention of returning to the restaurant and caution those with sensitive stomachs or a strong sense of smell to avoid it at all costs of course this is merely my own personal preference and opinion – but i appreciate being able to savor the true flavors of food instead of relying solely on heavily seasoned gravy and as for the odor… oh my goodness could you please bring us the check,0
i had such an amazing experience at this bar i joined some friends for a fun night out enjoying delicious drinks and playing games the lounge area was absolutely remarkable adorned with a spectacular wall of televisions that catered to any viewers preference the affordability of both drinks and food added to the overall appeal and the constant influx of new patrons ensured a lively atmosphere a mustvisit spot for locals wanting to make lasting memories,2
i received my phone call settled the bill and left the establishment feeling alarmingly sober and still hungry my mind and stomach were filled with nothing but unfulfilled promises its possible that the aforementioned experience has been influenced by the passage of time and an overdose of detective movies,1
while i found the hosts and our waitress to be very friendly and accommodating the manager didnt meet my expectations there was also another couple older and caucasian waiting to be seated and we were standing near them the manager greeted and welcomed them with a smile informing them that they would be seated soon i naturally assumed that we would receive the same warm welcome from him as well but he didnt even acknowledge us or greet us with a smile this offended me since we were just as much paying customers and shouldnt all customers be treated equally moreover he passed by us multiple times before we were finally seated without any form of acknowledgement or smile i couldnt help but feel insulted especially considering that my boyfriend and i look young and are asian i dont want to jump to conclusions about his motives but i definitely felt some prejudice coming from him,2
unfortunately the water had an odd taste that resembled a mop bucket used to clean a gym floor the tea that followed was equally sad with the stalest teabag ive ever encountered pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water i settled for a bottled drink but even the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable,1
if youre searching for an exceptional postworkout eatery this is it not only does this place serve up sandwiches swiftly avoiding the long waits commonly experienced at subway but their ingredient selection also surpasses expectations trust me you wont be disappointed by their flavorful vito and beach club offerings furthermore the workers here are consistently pleasant and courteous always greeting me warmly upon arrival and departure needless to say ill be coming back for more tasty subs,4
my intention was to enjoy a sandwich delivered directly to my location and i eagerly placed the order approximately one hour and 10 minutes ago at a specific sandwich shop curiosity piqued i made a call to ascertain the cause of this prolonged wait surprisingly they revealed that my address falls outside their designated delivery zone regrettably despite voluntarily disclosing my contact and hotel details they neglected to inform me proactively considering that i am currently on a business trip without access to personal transportation heavily relying on delivery services was my only recourse as time flew by and the clock struck midnight my frustration soared not accustomed to consuming meals at such an ungodly hour now amidst this unfavorable situation procuring sustenance has become an added challenge reflecting deeply on this disheartening experience i seriously contemplate expressing my dissatisfaction through a negative review the unfortunate combination of both subpar service and distasteful references related to marijuana culture further contribute to my disappointment with their establishment,0
ive lost track of the numerous occasions where ive walked past this place in mgm uncountable times yet my desire to give it a try has remained consistently strong finally i seized the opportunity to satisfy my curiosity and surprisingly it exceeded my expectations at first glance i considered it to be a runofthemill sandwich shop but they proved me wrong by offering a dazzling array of sandwiches that were remarkably appetizing personally i found the meatloaf sandwich to be truly satisfying and the chicken pesto panini was also quite decent additionally their allday availability of breakfast sandwiches is a delightful perk for those who adore breakfast food however the prices are rather high in comparison to other sandwich establishments particularly considering what you actually receive furthermore the dining area is on the smaller side and tends to feel cramped so if it gets crowded it does not lend itself to a comfortable dining experience,2
i made arrangements and booked a meeting with terminex a fortnight ahead of time i had multiple exchanges of text messages with dave s to confirm that my appointment would be at 1 pm on a saturday however he never appeared and ignored all my attempts to contact him around six hours later joe called me claiming to be the representative for my area and asked if i wanted to schedule another appointment despite my dissatisfaction with the companys service i reluctantly agreed during the rescheduled appointment joe presented me with an incredibly exorbitant price more than triple the rates offered by other companies i subsequently reached out to for less work and with shorter warranties there are numerous alternative termite control contractors that offer fair prices but this particular company seems to be involved in deceptive practices,0
is the pawn shop known for having a wide variety of items available but at high prices was paul the general manager rude in my experience is it unlikely that i will return to the shop due to the disrespectful treatment,1
this pub is incredible i visited with a few pals had a great time sipping drinks and playing games the lounge is mindblowing featuring an impressive display of tvs where you can watch anything you want the prices for drinks and food are reasonable and the bar always has a fresh crowd of people its perfect for locals who want to create new memories,2
the iced mocha crafted for me on a hot and tired saturday afternoon was pretty phenomenal at the end i kept slurping at the watered icey remnant hoping my cup would miraculously refill i love the chill and utilitarian atmosphere of the shop and the skill of the baristas just wish there were more locations to enjoy,3
johnny rockets has always been a beloved favorite of mine but i must express my disappointment with this particular establishment the unfriendly demeanor and lack of attentiveness exhibited by the female staff were quite offputting if you want to make sure you actually receive what you intended to order it is wise to have the staff repeat your order back to you on a personal note despite ordering a mouthwatering tuna melt what i ended up with was nothing more than a cold tuna sandwich which i had no choice but to throw away the entire experience felt like a total waste of 10 leading me to decide against returning here the next time im at the mall,1
man its definitely worth it dude,4
their breakfast deserves a fivestar rating but they should really update their air conditioning system in the rooms instead of providing a regular ac unit it feels more like a swamp cooler making the rooms hot and uncomfortably humid this is a problem ive never encountered at other embassy suites furthermore having more towels available by the pool would be greatly appreciated although there was initially a shortage someone finally brought some additional towels leading me to raise my rating to three stars,2
my waitress expressed regret over the subpar meal but seemed unsurprised by the disappointing outcome amidst the dusty surroundings faded posters and ancient paneling the only redeeming feature of that night was the fire island roll this burst of color flavor and spice managed to salvage the evening from turning into a scene straight out of a raymond chandler novel,1
after being a loyal patron for the past year i have finally taken the time to write a review for pho nam a small vietnamese restaurant they consistently deliver mouthwatering vietnamese cuisine and excellent customer service we often visit this restaurant for our sunday lunch especially during winter our usual orders include pho with tender beef and vermicelli with flavorful pork,3
i adore the mac and cheese that is served here it always comes with topnotch service the happy hour specials they offer are simply fabulous,3
 the basic deluxe room we initially had was decent but not too impressive however my travel companion discovered a bottle in his bed after the housekeeping service had been by resulting in an upgrade to one of the larger suites let me tell you it was like living in a mansion the room was massive and the staff regularly checked in to ensure we were comfortable,2
where can a girl easily find alcohol in this vicinity a group of friends and i wanted to pregame in our suite before going out to clubs so we decided to buy a bottle of belvedere however we didnt want to go far so we stumbled upon a store conveniently located downstairs from our hotel of course being situated on the strip and within a highend hotel the prices there were noticeably inflated compared to regular retail its a common trend for most places selling alcohol on the strip to charge above usual market rates unfortunately the store didnt stock belvedere forcing us to settle for grey goose as the next best option surprisingly a bottle of goose cost us nearly 85 when it could typically be purchased for around 40 at a grocery store in addition six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips amounted to almost 30 despite the costs we didnt mind since our main focus was enjoying ourselves fortunately having the store right downstairs was advantageous considering that ordering the same bottle through room service would have set us back a staggering 150,2
im hesitant to bust out 5 stars for this place because theyve only been open for 2 days but i cant help myself i think i may have found a new haunt nthe bartender possibly part owner and what i can only assume was the other owner were extremely attentive and nice just plain nice i miss nice alot most people are assholes ya ya youre probably thinking well it is day two of course theyre going to be overly attentive and that may be so i just hope it sticks nnthings were still in a very preliminary stage in a lot of ways but you can see the potential when you walk up the stairs super cute ikeaish decor couch like seating area as well as high bar tables low very chill lighting full bar thats right people full bar they even asked us our opinion on the music and if we had any recommendations awesome  the pour was good and strong and im told they are going to be married so to speak with pei wei to offer appetizers in the next couple weeks nnthere were only a couple of other people there at the time slightly older wine bar crowd nso lets band together get some sessy younger  mother fkrs together and turn this place into what its meant to be a badass downtown drink spot,4
we had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadnt eaten all day im the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or i grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off needless to say i needed to eat before someone got hurt nnwe had been wanting to try north end pizza for awhile so when i felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop nnno debating for me over what to order margherita special for the day yes in a large please and a side of fries nnthe fries werent great werent bad i dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved they brought out the pizza and i was a little disappointed it was a bit skimpy on the cheese nnafter my first slice i was hooked the crust is thin but not super thin the sauce has a lot of flavor and the mozzarella what there was of it was fresh my husband and i ate the entire large pizza right then and there,3
i had always been intrigued by the name of this place whenever i drove past it however one rainy evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady who i suspected was standing me up i decided to finally step inside and experience the exotic and modern atmosphere that the name and sign promised unfortunately i was disappointed as soon as i entered and saw the unimpressive decor despite that i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar surprisingly there was no sign of the chef or any other customers eventually an american woman emerged from the back and with an indistinguishable npr accent asked me which menus i preferred we engaged in pleasant conversation while being served several drinks unfortunately the water tasted strange resembling mop water used to clean a gym floor the tea was stale and pitifully leaked its flavor into the mop water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger but even the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable amidst the drinks i also ordered various courses of food which were presented apologetically as if the unseen and unheard chef was struggling with some sort of vortex in the spacetime continuum the entree came first followed by sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were withered the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was warmer and salted it seemed like someone had already taken all the interesting delicious and edible food before i arrived my waitress apologized for the order mixup appearing remorseful but not surprised the only redeeming aspect of that evening was the fire island roll which added some color flavor and spice to save the night from turning into a bleak raymond chandler novel after receiving my phone call and settling the bill i left the place feeling strangely sober and still hungry my thoughts were filled with unfulfilled promises and its possible that my recollection of the experience may have been influenced by time passing and too many detective movies,1
where is a girl suppose to buy alcohol around here nnme and some friends wanted to pregame in our suite before clubbin so we wanted to buy a bottle of belvedere but we didnt want to walk far so we found this place downstairs of our hotel now the prices here are of course jacked up because it is on the strip and in a nice hotel most places that sell alcohol on the strip sell if for more than its usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for the next best thing grey goose anyways a bottle of goose was almost 85 you can get it at a grocery market for like 40 something six bottles small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips came out to be almost 30 nnbut hey it was all so we could have fun so it didnt matter thank god for this place being right downstairs because if you ordered a bottle from room service that bad boy would cost you 150,2
i have passed by this place countless times while going to mgm and i always wanted to give it a try finally i got the chance and it exceeded my expectations initially i assumed it was just an ordinary sandwich shop but they had an impressive variety of sandwiches that were delicious the meatloaf sandwich was particularly satisfying and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad either a great perk is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long for the breakfast lovers like me however the prices are on the higher side compared to other sandwich places especially considering what you get additionally the dining area is quite small and cramped so if it gets crowded it doesnt create a comfortable dining experience,2

i love johnny rockets this location is a total disappointment the girls that work there arent very friendly and dont pay attention you order i would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want i ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away it was a total waste of 10 i will pass on this place the next time i eat at the mall,1
the food at this place is excellent and the service is exceptional whether i have breakfast or lunch my experience has always been amazing im truly impressed by the friendly and helpful nature of all the staff members today even the owner went out of their way to check on us its truly a wonderful place with such kind people and delicious food—i adore coming here,4
due to the disrespectful attitude from the general manager named paul and the inflated prices it is highly unlikely that i will return to this pawn shop,1
countless times ive been to mgm and passed by this place without ever giving it a try but finally i mustered up the courage and boy was i pleasantly surprised it far surpassed my expectations initially i had dismissed it as just another ordinary sandwich shop but they proved me wrong with their diverse and mouthwatering array of sandwiches the meatloaf sandwich left me completely satisfied and the chicken pesto panini wasnt too shabby either the added bonus is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day catering to those of us who crave breakfast food at any hour however its worth noting that the prices are on the higher side compared to other sandwich places particularly considering the value for money additionally the dining area is rather cramped and small which doesnt make for a comfortable experience when it gets crowded,2
i have a strong fondness for the mac and cheese they serve here and the service is consistently excellent the happy hour deals are truly exceptional,3
wow this bar exceeded all my expectations i had the best time hanging out with a couple of buddies indulging in great beverages and engaging in exciting games the lounge area took my breath away its massive collection of tv screens allowed me to watch anything my heart desired whats more the prices for drinks and food were very reasonable making it even more enjoyable with a constant flow of new faces this place is a true gem for the locals seeking to create memorable experiences,2
on approaching the mgm i found it to be a respectable place to stay with its enormous size and captivating green illumination in the evening the presence of the iconic lion statue let everyone know where they were headed stepping into the expansive and extravagant lobby i was greeted by remarkably friendly staff who efficiently checked us into our suite within a few hours of housekeepings attention while the basic room was adequate a fortunate surprise – finding a bottle in my companions bed after it had been cleaned – led to an upgrade to one of the larger suites let me emphasize the sheer magnificence of our living space it was incredibly spacious and the attentive staff ensured our needs were met unfortunately the room service food failed to impress and the absence of a kitchenette meant being stuck with unsatisfying pizza and a cold breakfast,2
this restaurant embodies the vegas spirit in both good and cheesy ways the atmosphere feels like a local cheers bar combined with a vegas disco ball  cozy friendly and vibrant the interior design takes you into a neonfilled disco wonderland with disco glass covering the pillars and ceilings amidst the distractions of giant tv screens and neon lighting theres a cool lounge area in the back but we decided to enjoy the bustling brunch in the front reminiscent of a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80s mixed with dennys peppermill however stands out with its fantastic food and generous portions i absolutely fell in love with the decor  each table is a comfortable booth with big leather couches the arrangement allows for visibility without feeling exposed as if you were sitting in secret gardens adorned with giant fake trees flowers vines draping from the ceiling and tiffanyesque lamps shaped like flamingos hovering overhead under a full moon it creates a peaceful ambiance while still being in the vibrant vegas atmosphere,3
the overall experience at this johnny rockets outlet has left me thoroughly disappointed the girls working there lack friendliness and attentiveness when taking orders to guarantee receiving the right order i suggest having them reconfirm it for accuracy unfortunately my own encounter consisted of ordering a tuna melt only to be presented with a cold tuna sandwich that ended up in the trash what a waste of 10 in the future i will definitely skip dining at this mall’s johnny rockets establishment,1
moving on to the food it was decent but nothing extraordinary the half order of louisiana oysters was tasty and my louisiana red fish filet sautéed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was cooked well i particularly enjoyed the flavor of the crab and how it complemented the fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had a strong salty oceanic taste that may not appeal to everyone it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which tasted better than the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also disappointing as it lacked flavor,2
i was really nervous when i walked into the place because other places had told me they couldnt treat transgender women before their surgery but thankfully i found this amazing place no matter how many times i asked if they were okay with it they always responded positively the experience was welcoming and the place was very clean with a beautiful shade of purple the bed i lay on was comfortable like one you would find in a doctors room they wore gloves and everything was done professionally the pain wasnt too bad just felt like rubberbands snapping against me i flinched every time but it ended quickly the quality of the work was amazing i was worried about the black specks but after washing my face and applying sunscreen i could see that the shadow was less noticeable in conclusion ivy laser salon is an awesome place that is lgbtfriendly clean painless and provides highquality service,4
meeting up with my friend for her birthday lunch i reached the restaurant ahead of her and made a prompt request for a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the busy atmosphere the staff swiftly accommodated my need however our server seemed burdened with numerous thoughts projecting an air of seriousness and a touch of sternness as i ordered a salad and minestrone soup while my friend chose her favorite appetizer the taste of both dishes brought back pleasant memories although the server offered parmesan for the salad she failed to extend the same offer when serving the soup we enjoyed our time at the table and when our server graciously informed us that she was going on a break she assured us that we could remain as long as we liked with another server ready to assist us if required such thoughtfulness made our experience even nicer,3
as the food started to arrive we decided to order a pot of oolong tea to go along with our dishes however we were informed that the tea and the glasses of water on our table were actually tap water notwithstanding this fact the steamed white rice tasted acceptable and i consumed a significant portion of it the dungeness crab arrived already chopped up but still remained inside the shell covered in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce that overpowered its delectable flavor similarly the lobster was served in pieces also smothered in sauce making it challenging and messy to handle especially when trying to serve it to ourselves from the lazy susan additionally one dish consisted of cod with bones intact including its eyes preserved entirely due to previous experiences with fish bones i did not dare to even taste it however everyone else at the table devoured the whole thing including the brain eyeballs and cheeks which somewhat disgusts me in the end i have no desire to return to this restaurant and i highly recommend that individuals with delicate stomachs or a strong sense of smell steer clear of this place at all costs again this is solely based on my personal preference and opinion for me its essential to taste the actual food and not just the seasoned gravy drenched on top and dont even get me started on the smell can we have the check please,0
the service from the hosts and our waitress was friendly and great however i was disappointed by the managers behavior there was an older caucasian couple waiting to be seated next to us and when the manager walked by he smiled greeted them and assured them they would be seated soon i expected him to extend the same warm welcome to us but he didnt even acknowledge us it made me feel offended and showed a lack of equality in greeting customers moreover he passed by us multiple times without a smile or a greeting while i dont want to assume any racial prejudice i couldnt help but feel that way as my boyfriend and i are asian and appear quite young,2
after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i developed a sudden craving for seafood however my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt entirely unexpected we had reserved a table for 715 pm but since the restaurant was quite busy we had to wait until exactly 715 pm to be seated the restaurant itself looked like your typical seafood and grill establishment with dim lighting a central bar booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it didnt really have a distinct oceanic ambience but then again i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or anything of that sort considering it is a more upscale place,2
living close to el gordito supermarket means having easy access but i find myself going there infrequently due to the presence of flies throughout the premises even worse the hot and ready food on display is often left uncovered causing it to dry out surprisingly despite its condition the staff continues to serve the driedout food one unfortunate experience involved purchasing a torta with spoiled meat which made it taste repulsive adding to the unpleasant sight you can spot flies inside the glass display case where the bread is showcased,0
the iced mocha i enjoyed on a scorching and exhausting saturday afternoon was truly extraordinary even as i reached the bottom of my cup i couldnt help but hope for a magical refill the coffeehouses cool and practical ambiance coupled with the baristas expertise impressed me greatly my only wish is that there were additional branches to savor their offerings,3
let me preface my review by stating a few facts  1 my boyfriend and his family are chinese and they were dining with me  2 the aforementioned chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic chinese cuisine  3 i put on a happy face and ate as much rice as i could to fill up    i like to start any decent meal with a good handwashing especially when eating with my chinese inlaws when theyre in town from china  i went into the bathroom at diamonds and i almost hurled  i am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something  i felt obligated to stay and eat  i left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead    so the food began to appear  we ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal  we were warned that it along with the glasses of water on our table was tap water  the steamed white rice was fine and dandy and i ate most of it  we got dungeness crab served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was nonetootasty and killed the delicious crab taste  we also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce with the meat still inside  this method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan  we also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head completely intact  i did not even taste it as ive had some bad experiences with fish bones  the rest of the table ate the whole thing including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks  shudder  just a matter of personal preference but i cant do that  nnall in all i would never go back  ever  and id advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs  again this is simply my preference and opinion  but i like to taste my food not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it  and the smell oh good heavens  check please,0
the general manager paul exhibited rude behavior so i probably wont visit the pawn shop again due to the lack of respect and the high prices of the items they offer,1
for an entire year ive faithfully supported pho nam a charming smallscale vietnamese restaurant managed by a tightknit family now at long last im seizing the opportunity to compose a review about their phenomenal vietnamese fare and exceptional customer care without fail we find ourselves gravitating towards this establishment for sunday lunches especially during the winter months when hearty bowls of pho with perfectly cooked rare beef and a serving of mouthwatering vermicelli topped with savory pork become our goto orders,3
this johnny rockets location is extremely disappointing the staff working there are not friendly or attentive when taking your order i suggest asking them to repeat your order so you actually receive what you want i ordered a tuna melt but received a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away wasting 10 i will avoid eating at this malls johnny rockets next time,1
moved in with a friend and its quite ridiculous the laundry room next to us has no air conditioning and the machines are constantly broken plus the place is extremely dirty i spoke to maintenance about it and they claimed its on their list to fix but not a high priority i asked my roommate who has been living here for four years and he said he doesnt remember the laundry working at all to make matters worse there is dog poop left in front of our door every morning and management refuses to do anything about it on top of that there are no dishwashers or special amenities here yet they charge absurdly high prices for just a onebedroom apartment maintenance rarely fixes things properly and management simply doesnt care just last month the entire office staff was fired  one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up people are even breaking their leases just to get out of this mess since all of this chaos started happening the outofstate management has decided to force all section 8 renters to move out by december regardless of their rental agreements thankfully with all these people leaving our shared water bill has gone down the apartment itself is quite spacious for a onebedroom but theres a storage room that could easily be converted into a washerdryer area additionally the kitchen and bathroom cabinets desperately need updating simply repainting wont cut it anymore the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stubborn stains that just wont come off lastly we keep finding crickets and bugs crawling through the front door due to the large gaps,0
this guy is definitely worth the investment my friend,4
where can a young woman conveniently purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i planned to pregame before going clubbing in our suite so we wanted to buy a bottle of belvedere we preferred not to walk long distances so luckily we discovered a store downstairs in our hotel however the prices there are inflated due to its location on the strip and being part of a luxurious hotel most alcohol vendors on the strip charge more than the usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for the next best option grey goose surprisingly a bottle of goose cost us almost 85 while it could be found for around 40something at a regular grocery market additionally six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips added up to nearly 30 nonetheless we were willing to pay extra for the convenience and fun considering that ordering the same bottle through room service would have cost us a whopping 150,2
i am inclined to give them a fivestar rating primarily due to the quality of their breakfast however i do think that they should improve their air conditioning system as the rooms felt more like using a swamp cooler instead of a regular ac unit it was quite hot and humid inside the rooms because of this this experience was unusual for me as i have stayed at various embassy suites before another minor issue was the limited availability of towels at the pool but fortunately someone eventually brought some more towels the saving grace was their breakfast which bumped up my rating to three stars,2
this place is simply fantastic the quality of the food is outstanding and the service provided is absolutely wonderful every time i visit for either breakfast or lunch i am consistently delighted by my experience its remarkable how the employees are so genuinely friendly and eager to assist in fact today the owner personally came over to our table to inquire about our satisfaction—such an extraordinary gesture from such lovely individuals im truly enamored with this place and its delectable offerings,4
in our stroll together my wife and i silently communicated a mutual sentiment using only two words never again it all came down to the disappointing encounter we had while exiting a particular venue spending an exorbitant 14 dollars on a sundae that failed to impress despite the famous max brenner being within easy walking distance even though i anticipated it to be a tourist trap due to its negative reception others in our group were determined to go irrespective of the warnings if given the choice id much rather invest the same amount of money on purchasing three distinctive ben  jerrys ice cream tubs from the local grocery store,1
immediately disappointed upon seeing the interior decor i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the cramped classroom chairs at the sushi bar neither the sushi chef nor any customers were present but soon an american woman emerged from the back with a nondescript npr accent in her tired state we engaged in pleasant conversation while an array of drinks were brought before us,1
hey man totally worth it dude,4
arriving early to celebrate my friends birthday with a special lunch i took the initiative to secure a table accommodating her wheelchair despite a bustling atmosphere my request was promptly fulfilled a testament to the efficiency of the busy staff notably our server appeared deep in thought exuding a serious and almost austere demeanor as my friend ordered her alltime favorite appetizer i opted for the refreshing salad and an exquisite minestrone soup  both exceeding my expectations just as they always had curiously the server kindly offered grated parmesan cheese for the salad but failed to extend the same option for the soup upon its arrival we leisurely enjoyed our time at the table when our server considerately informed us she would be taking a break assuring us that we were welcome to stay as long as we desired furthermore she mentioned another server who would be available to offer any assistance needed  a thoughtful touch that left a positive impression,3
while taking a walk my wife and i exchanged two words never again the reason behind it was our recent experience at a certain place where we unwisely spent 14 bucks on an underwhelming sundae even though the highly regarded max brenner was conveniently nearby despite knowing about its poor reviews our fellow companions insisted on visiting disregarding any caution personally id prefer buying three separate pints of ben  jerrys ice cream from the supermarket with the same amount of money,1
looking for the perfect place to refuel after a demanding workout look no further this spot offers prompt service eliminating the need to wait around like you would at subway moreover the ingredients they use in their sandwiches are topnotch guaranteeing an excellent culinary experience dont miss out on trying the mouthwatering vito and beach club options plus ive always had positive encounters with the friendly and welcoming staff count me in for more of their scrumptious subs,4
i was completely smitten with the decor each table resembles a booth with large leather couches the arrangement allows for visibility while also providing a sense of individual seclusion its like sitting in a group of visible secret gardens especially with the giant fake trees flowers and vines draping down from the ceiling above each table tiffanyesque lamps shaped like big flamingos hang casting a serene light akin to watching a flock grazing at night,3
i dont know how many times ive been through mgm and passed by this place  ive always wanted to try it and i finally did  it was better than i thoughtnni figured it to be your regular sandwich shop  however they offered a dazzling variety of sandwiches that were pretty tasty  i was pretty happy w the meatloaf sand which and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad eithernnthey serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is an added bonus for all of us that love breakfast foodnni will say that the prices are pretty high compared to other sand which places especially for what youre getting  the dining area is also pretty small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt build for a comfy dining experience,2
the bar is amazing where i went with some friends to have a good time enjoy drinks and engage in games the extraordinary lounge with its wall of televisions allows you to watch anything you desire furthermore the prices of both food and drinks are quite reasonable and there is always a presence of new faces making it an ideal place for locals to create cherished new memories,2
moved in with a friend and its ridiculous the laundry room on one side doesnt have air conditioning and the machines are always broken the place is dirty too i talked to maintenance about it but they said fixing it is not a priority i asked my roommate who has lived here for four years and he said he cant remember the laundry room ever working properly and there are even several large machines that dont work at all to make things worse there is dog poop left right in front of our door every morning and when we complain to management they say theres nothing they can do about it there are no special amenities or dishwasher here yet the prices for just one bedroom are unreasonably high maintenance never fixes anything correctly and management doesnt seem to care last month the entire office staff was fired one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up people are breaking their leases just to get out of this place since then the outofstate management has given section 8 renters until december to move out regardless of their rental agreements the only positive thing about people leaving is that our shared water bill has decreased the apartment itself is spacious for a onebedroom but theres a storage room that could easily be converted into a laundry area additionally the kitchen and bathroom cabinets desperately need updating repainting wont cut it  the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are permanent stains that wont come out lastly crickets and bugs keep finding their way inside through the gaps in the front door,0
these individuals seem to find it too bothersome to shred imitation crab as they have now resorted to using a food processor to grind it into an unappealing mealy mush unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh i brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on allyoucaneat but there was nothing appetizing for me after tasting the first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself however her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she doesnt eat a lot being only 7 years old my beloved volcano roll which used to be outstanding turned out to be a disgusting gritty mush with rice and eel sauce haphazardly thrown on top the moment i tasted it i literally spat it out in disgust i left this repulsive mess on the plate and silently dared them to question me about it trying to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll which used to be flavorful with shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo to my dismay it also contained the abominable crabgrit mush fed up with the crab debacle i changed my strategy and started ordering nigiri the yellowtail was barely recognizable and lacked any resemblance to its usual appearance when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i also gave the cajun albacore a try managing to enjoy it slightly since the ponzu sauce masked the unpleasant taste of the notsofresh fish in hindsight i should have walked out when i first entered the restaurant and was greeted by a strong fishy odor to make matters worse when my daughter and i attempted to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for disgusting sushi and i can only have one lousy mochi i refuse to ever set foot in this establishment again just the mere thought of that night makes me feel nauseous,0
not worth a visit the employees are respectful and nice but no personality more like zombies walking around doing their jobs i ordered coconut chicken soup should have been called mushroom soup as thats the majority in the soup the soup itself was bland bland enough to not want to drink the soup but trying fishing for the bits of chicken inside my other half ordered mint pork his normal thai order he said the hotness was perfect and the taste was awesome for him i suppose if we did come back it would be for him only and to go my daughter ordered beef broccoli she liked the beef and broccoli but the sauce has too much clam juice which made her feel she was eating more of a fish entree the customers who come in seem to be more on the ghetto side so expect to hear loud mouth complaints but i must say the employees took at it well but in a robot motion think zombies lol you know they were cussing the ghetto people out in the kitchen lol over all not a place to visit but if you want to gamble a good visit then go ahead,1
an hour and 10 minutes elapsed since i placed an order for a sandwich to be delivered by a specific sandwich shop eager to discover the cause behind the delay i recently made a phone call to check on my order to my dismay they informed me that my delivery address falls beyond their designated zone its perplexing because i am merely 3 miles away from their location and even shared my contact details and hotel information for communication purposes since im currently out of town on business and do not possess a car relying on delivery was my primary option now its well past midnight and consuming meals this late goes against my preferences consequently i find myself tasked with searching for an alternative to obtain food normally i dont experience such intense dissatisfaction that prompts writing negative reviews on yelp but given the unsatisfactory service and unoriginal employment of 420 innuendos this situation merits one,0
statement 3 the employees at this place treat customers with respect and kindness however they lack any notable individuality and instead move about like mindless zombies following their tasks my order of coconut chicken soup turned out to be predominantly mushroom soup disappointingly the soup itself lacked any distinct taste making it unappetizing and difficult to consume nevertheless uncovering the occasional bits of chicken provided some redemption conversely my partners choice of mint pork a regular thai dish met their expectations perfectly in terms of spice level and flavor if we were to consider revisiting this place it would solely be for their satisfaction and for takeout purposes meanwhile my daughter enjoyed her beef broccoli finding the beef and broccoli appealing unfortunately the sauce contained an excess of clam juice resulting in a fishier taste than desired the patrons who frequent this place tend to display a more rowdy demeanor frequently airing their complaints loudly although the employees handled these situations professionally their response seemed somewhat robotic or zombielike raising suspicions of potential venting in the kitchen in conclusion i do not recommend visiting this establishment unless you are willing to take a risky chance,1
accompanied by some coworkers i decided to check out this establishment but my experience left much to be desired their expensive sandwiches failed to surpass the taste and value offered at jasons deli mind you im not exactly enthralled by jasons deli either however if you crave a decent sandwich its probably your best bet despite my initial inclination to rate this place a 3 its exorbitant prices knocked it down to a disappointing 2,1
i am having reservations about giving this place a 5star rating because they just opened 2 days ago however i cant help but feel that i may have discovered a new favorite spot the bartender who i suspect is also one of the owners and the other owner were extremely attentive and friendly which is a rarity these days most people are jerks you know i understand if you think theyre only being overly attentive because its their second day but i hope they maintain this level of service,4
after being a regular customer for the last year ive finally gotten around to reviewing  pho nam small family owned restaurant theyve always provided delicious vietnamese food and great service we frequent this restaurant for sunday lunch particularly in the winters and our orders usually consist of pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,3
during my visit my friends and i shared two dishes first was the munchs breakfast consisting of sautéed peppers onions linguica sausage on top of hash browns topped with two eggs cooked any way it was good and satisfyingly large although not particularly memorable secondly we had the maserati omelette  an unexpected combination of meaty tomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses hash browns and a choice of toast bagel or muffin this dish was surprisingly delicious and i would definitely recommend it,3
we spent the entire afternoon under the scorching sun without having any meal i am the type of person who needs to eat every two hours or else i become extremely irritable and complain about even the slightest issue needless to say i urgently needed to eat before someone ended up getting hurt we had been wanting to try out north end pizza for some time now so when i felt a craving for devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesy deliciousness after being exposed to the sun all day we finally decided to make a stop there,3
around one hour and 10 minutes back i made an order for a sandwich to be delivered from a sandwich shop nearby curiosity led me to call them just now and inquire why the delivery is taking so long surprisingly they informed me that they checked my address and discovered it lies beyond their delivery range its quite baffling since im only 3 miles away whats worse i shared my contact number and hotel information with them assuming they would use it to notify me about any issues being on a business trip without access to a vehicle relying on delivery seemed like the best option sadly its already past midnight and consuming meals this late isnt something i enjoy now i need to explore other alternatives to satisfy my hunger i rarely feel compelled to write negative feedback on yelp but considering the subpar service and their unimaginative usage of marijuana references this experience genuinely calls for it,0
there was no dilemma for me when it came to choosing what to order the margherita special caught my attention right away and i requested a large pizza along with a side of fries the fries were neither exceptional nor terrible however they instantly improved in taste once i added some garlic salt on them when the pizza arrived i must admit that i was slightly disappointed to find it lacking in cheese,3
an added perk is that your meal includes a complimentary 4x6 photo souvenir—cheesy but so perfectly vegas i loved it and consider it a cherished memory of that weekend lastly lets not forget the colored sugar—nothing groundbreaking but it exemplifies the carefree and funloving spirit of las vegas,3
during a hot and tiring saturday afternoon i savored an impeccably crafted iced mocha that left me in awe as i slurped the last drops i couldnt help but silently wish for a miraculous refill the coffee shops cool and efficient vibe combined with the baristas remarkable talent gained my admiration it would be perfect if there were additional spots where i could enjoy their unique ambiance,3
ill give them five stars based on breakfast the rooms itself they need to update their airconditioning system  the rooms feel more like a swamp cooler than a regular ac unit not to mention hot humid the rooms feel because its like a swamp cooler ive stayed at different embassy suites and never felt this before wouldve been nice if they had more towels available at the pool but after a long wait someone came along and brought some more towels thank goodness for the breakfast thats a bumped up  my rating to the three stars,2
as for the food the coffee is colombian and served in ample cups with free refills—a definite necessity after any decent night out in vegas my friends and i shared two dishes munchs breakfast consisting of sautéed peppers onions and linguica sausage over hash browns with two eggs cooked to your preference—it was good and substantial but not highly impressive the maserati omelette however stole the show featuring a meatytomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses and served with hash browns and your choice of toast bagel or muffin this unexpected combination worked remarkably well,3
i absolutely adore the mac n cheese available at this place the service i experience here never fails to impress me and the happy hour offerings are absolutely delightful,3
there was no doubt or hesitation in my mind about what to order i went straight for the margherita special of the day large size please additionally a side of fries was also ordered the fries werent exceptional nor were they terrible however a sprinkle of garlic salt instantly improved their flavor as soon as they brought out the pizza i couldnt help but feel a little disappointed it seemed like they had been a bit stingy with the cheese,3
so after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a  hankering for seafood  haha well actually my bf made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt quite so sudden so we had reservations for 715pm but we were a bit early and usually restaurants allow for early incomers to be seated but since they were quite busy we actually had to wait till 715pmwhich is fine nnthe place looked like your usual seafood and grill restaurantnot much uniqueness in its arrangement or settingdimly lit with bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left didnt really have much of a seafoodoceany feel to it but eh i guess i didnt expect it to be like joes crab shack or something afterall  this is a fancier place nni thought the service from the hosts and our waitress was very friendly and great but on the other hand the manager wasnt how i expect them to be so there was this older caucasian couple that was also waiting to be seatedand we were standing close to themthe manager walks by smiles and welcomes them and tells them theyll be seated sooni was thinking that we would get the same nice friendly greet and welcome from him but he didnt even smile or say hi i felt offended because we were customers tooand shouldnt you greet your customers all the same way not only that but he walked passed us several times before we were seated without a greet or smilei just felt very insulted my bf and i look quite young and we are asianim not saying hes races but i did feel he was prejudice nnwell anyways on to the foodthe food was decent nothing to really rave aboutthe half order of louisiana oysters were pretty good my louisiana red fish filet sauteed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was made very welli specially like the crab and the lemon chive butter sauce went very well with the fish on the other hand my bfs broiled swordfish had a very strong oceany saltfishy  tastewhich some might not be fond ofand it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which was better tasting then the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also somewhat of a disappointment since it too lack taste nnoverall i didnt really have a super spectacular dining experience at this restaurant hopefully the other locations of wildfish seafood grille are much better the bill came out to be around 80seafood is expensive but i was also paying for quality of service food and atmosphere of which i didnt feel like i got my bfs moneys worth,2
i went to meet my friend for her birthday lunch arriving before her and requesting a wheelchairaccessible table despite being busy my request was quickly granted the server appeared preoccupied with a serious and somewhat stern demeanor for our orders my friend chose her favorite appetizer while i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both of which tasted just as good as i remembered while the server offered parmesan for the salad she didnt offer any for the soup upon its arrival we decided to prolong our stay at the table and the server kindly informed us that she was going on break but assured us that we could remain as long as we wanted with another server available if needed it was a nice and considerate gesture,3
the food served at this establishment is nothing short of amazing and the level of service is truly commendable each time ive had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast or lunch here it has resulted in a memorable experience what astounds me the most is the unfailing friendliness and assistance provided by every single employee today even the owner made a point to stop by our table to ensure everything was perfect—an exceptional display of kindness this place radiates warmth and offers delectable cuisine—i cant help but enthusiastically anticipate each visit,4
i placed an order for a sandwich over an hour and 10 minutes ago from a sandwich shop for delivery however upon calling to inquire about the delay they informed me that my address is outside of their delivery area despite providing them with my contact details and hotel information they failed to notify me earlier being away on business without access to a car i am dependent on delivery services it is now past midnight and i dislike eating at such a late hour now i have to find another way to get food this experience was so disappointing that it even compelled me to consider writing a negative review highlighting both the poor service and inappropriate innuendos associated with their brand,0
i scheduled an appointment with terminex two weeks in advance and confirmed the time through multiple text exchanges with dave s however he did not show up or respond to my calls and texts after waiting for about 6 hours joe another representative of the company called me to schedule a new appointment despite my dissatisfaction i agreed during this appointment joe presented me with a bid that was incredibly high more than three times the price of other companies i had contacted for less work and a shorter warranty there are numerous other termite control contractors that offer reasonable prices but this particular company seems to be operating like a racket,0
an hour and 10 minutes elapsed since i ordered a sandwich from a particular sandwich shop expecting it to be delivered promptly to my dismay when i called to check on the status of my order i discovered that they realized it was beyond their designated delivery area despite sharing my phone number and hotel information beforehand they neglected to inform me sooner given my current situation being away on business and lacking transportation i rely heavily on delivery services moreover dining this late at night is not preferable to me consequently finding an alternative means of obtaining food has become an added inconvenience the whole ordeal left me thoroughly dissatisfied prompting thoughts of expressing my disappointment through a negative review such dissatisfaction stems from both the inadequate service and the distasteful 420related references associated with their establishment,0
overall we spent 44 for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip while slightly pricey it was worth every penny for its ability to recharge us after our last night in vegas this restaurant has definitely earned a spot in my list of mustvisit places in vegas,3
these individuals seem to avoid shredding the imitation crab because it requires too much effort instead they simply throw it into a food processor and grind it until it becomes an unappetizing mealy mush to make matters worse the fish pieces were not fresh either despite spending 62 on allyoucaneat sushi there was nothing appealing to eat after the first bite i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself unfortunately her roll came as a cut roll but she couldnt finish it since shes only 7 years old and my oncefavorite volcano roll turned out to be a disgusting pile of gritty mush with rice and eel sauce on top it was so awful that i had to spit it out disgusted i left the plate with the nasty mush untouched and secretly dared them to question me trying to salvage the meal i decided to order a mexican roll that used to be delicious with shredded crab shrimp spicy mayo and avocado yet again the revolting crabgrit mush made its appearance fed up with the crab situation i switched to ordering nigiri the yellowtail was barely recognizable and did not resemble yellowtail at all despite the sushi chefs assurance however the cajun albacore was slightly enjoyable thanks to the strong ponzu sauce masking the notsofresh taste of the fish in hindsight i should have walked out when i first entered the place and was hit by the overpowering smell of fish adding insult to injury my daughter and i wanted to order mochi but were told we could only have one per person seriously im paying 62 for terrible sushi and i can only have one measly mochi i vow never to set foot in this atrocious excuse for a sushi bar again just recalling that night makes me want to gag,0
the atmosphere of this restaurant embodies both the good and tacky aspects of las vegas it feels like a local version of cheers meets a flashy disco ball with a cozy and friendly vibe the interior design is reminiscent of stepping into a neonlined disco ball adorned with disco glass on pillars and ceilings giant tv screens and neon lighting surround everything creating an energetic ambiance there is also a cool lounge area in the back but we chose to dine in the bustling restaurant at the front imagine dennys on a flamboyant gay cruise from the 80s and youll get a sense of what peppermill offers except with extraordinary food and generous portions,3
this establishment has proven to be an exceptional bar where i had an excellent time in the company of close companions relishing delightful beverages while engaging in amusing games the lounge itself is nothing short of astonishing thanks to its vast array of television screens allowing guests to watch whatever they please additionally the affordability of the food and drinks draws in a diverse clientele affording locals the chance to partake in creating precious moments and treasured experiences,2
statement 1 the employees at this place are respectful and nice but lack personality and are reminiscent of zombies going about their jobs the coconut chicken soup i ordered should have been named mushroom soup since mushrooms dominated it the soup itself was tasteless and unappetizing making me reluctant to drink it however the bits of chicken inside were worth fishing for my partner enjoyed their usual thai order of mint pork finding it perfectly spicy and delicious if we ever return it would be solely for their enjoyment and for takeout my daughter had the beef broccoli which she liked in terms of the beef and broccoli but found the sauce overpoweringly fishy due to excessive clam juice the customers who frequented this place tended to be more on the rowdy side often expressing their complaints loudly despite this the employees handled these situations well almost like emotionless robots or zombies possibly even cursing at unruly patrons behind closed doors in the kitchen in conclusion while i do not recommend visiting this establishment if youre willing to take a chance then go ahead,1
together with some coworkers i ventured to this location and left feeling underwhelmed by their pricey sandwiches that did not exceed the standard set by jasons deli let me clarify i do not hold jasons deli in high regard but if you desire a fairly decent sandwich it would be wise to visit them instead if i were to rate this establishment on a scale from 1 to 5 i originally inclined towards a 3 however its exorbitant cost demoted it to a mere 2,1
as we were leaving my wife and i uttered a simple phrase never again we paid 14 dollars for a sundae that was only average in taste even though the popular max brenner is just a short stroll away despite the negative feedback some of our companions insisted on going to this spot which i already suspected would be overrun by tourists personally id rather spend the same amount of money on three different pints of ben  jerrys from the grocery store,1
im not completely sure how five guys manages to meet the outdated serving regulations of north carolina by offering juicy burgers that are not medium rare it could be due to their specific meat grinding process that includes just the right amount of fat or perhaps it is the way they cook the burgers to order on a flattop regardless of the method they succeed in delivering a satisfying meal with an abundance of condiments to choose from the fries at this place are exceptional as well  freshly cut and fried to near perfection available plain or seasoned with cajun spices you can tell they take their fries seriously when they provide the days potato location and offer malt vinegar for extra flavor furthermore the staff at this location deserves praise for their ability to consistently serve burgers and fries even during busy periods all while maintaining a friendly demeanor overall they excel in providing a quality dining experience,4
we had spent the entire afternoon under the scorching sun without having any meals being someone who cannot function properly without eating every two hours i tend to get extremely agitated over trivial matters if i dont eat on time naturally i needed to have something to eat before things got out of hand we had been meaning to try north end pizza for quite some time so when the craving for 56 slices of delicious and cheesy goodness struck after a tiring day in the sun we finally decided to stop by,3
i am deeply dissatisfied with this specific johnny rockets branch the employees at this place are not very welcoming nor do they pay attention to your order i recommend doublechecking your order by having them repeat it to ensure you get the correct meal my personal experience involved ordering a tuna melt and being served an unsatisfactory cold tuna sandwich forcing me to discard it this incident was a complete waste of 10 next time i visit the mall i wont be considering dining at this particular johnny rockets location,1
i had an incredible experience at this bar as i joined a group of friends to savor delicious drinks indulge in entertaining games and appreciate the unbelievable lounge featuring a wall filled with tvs offering endless viewing options whats remarkable is that the prices of both food and drinks are very affordable attracting a constant flow of fresh faces providing locals with a perfect opportunity to make lasting new memories,2

the iced mocha i enjoyed on a scorching and exhausting saturday afternoon was absolutely amazing and even after finishing it i couldnt resist savoring the melted ice left in my cup secretly hoping for a magically replenished beverage the shops cool and practical ambiance along with the baristas expertise truly captivated me its just unfortunate that there arent more places like it to indulge in,3
the name of this place had intrigued me every time i drove by until one drizzling dismal evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady i suspected was standing me up i stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic lusty and modern experience the name and sign promisednnimmediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor i draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence a young woman american came from the back and in an unplaceable npr accent asked me which menus id like clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before mennthe water tasted  odd  smelling of a mopbucket after cleaning a gym floor tea next in the saddest stalest teabag i have ever seen pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water okay something bottled and stronger alas the sake was lukewarm and unremarkablennsomewhere amidst the drinks buffet id ordered several courses of food which came out apologetically ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the spacetime continuum  entree immediately then sushi soup then finally a wilted miserable salad the rice was dry the chicken bland the vegetables wilted the soup was the mopwater but warmer and salted presumably someone had come in advance of me ordered the entire restaurants supply of interesting delicious and tolerable then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophiesnnmy waitress apologized about the order looking contrite but not surprisednnthe shining light of that eveningapart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust faded posters and ancient panelingwas the fire island roll  this single element of color flavor and spice rescued the night from the raymond chandler direction it was takingnni got my phone call paid my tab and left frighteningly sober and still hungry my head and stomach full of naught but unfulfilled promisesnned its entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time and too many detective movies,1
as we were leaving my spouse and i exchanged two simple words never again we paid a visit to this spot in hopes of enjoying a sundae but it turned out to be just okay interestingly enough max brenner is conveniently located nearby making the choice to go here feel like falling for a tourist trap despite knowing about the negative feedback others insisted on going personally i would have preferred purchasing three unique flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket instead,1
statement 2 although the employees here are polite and friendly they lack individuality and seem to move through their tasks like lifeless zombies when i ordered the coconut chicken soup i was surprised to find that the majority of its contents were mushrooms instead moreover the soup itself lacked flavor and failed to entice me to finish it however salvaging the experience were the occasional bits of chicken hidden within on the other hand my partner thoroughly enjoyed their usual thai dish of mint pork finding it to be perfectly spiced and exceptionally tasty if we were to reconsider another visit it would be purely for their satisfaction and to opt for takeout as for my daughters choice of beef broccoli she appreciated the flavors of the beef and broccoli but was put off by an overly briny sauce due to an excessive amount of clam juice expect a rather noisy crowd with complaints leaning more towards the uncivilized side but i must admit that the employees handled these situations gracefully almost mechanically as if they were secretly expressing their frustration in the kitchen all things considered i do not recommend visiting this establishment unless youre willing to take a gamble,1
five guys seems to have cracked the code when it comes to adhering to a legacy food regulation in north carolina that forbids serving medium rare beef nevertheless they manage to serve mouthwatering burgers through a combination of factors like their special grind with just the right amount of fat and their cooking method on the flattop tailored to individual preferences moreover their burgers are accompanied by an array of toppings to choose from and their fries are simply irresistible—freshly prepared perfectly cut and served almost flawlessly either plain or seasoned with delectable cajun spices a remarkable aspect is their dedication to fries going so far as to provide the location details of the potatoes used and offering malt vinegar for those seeking a unique flavor remarkably the staff at this particular location excels at maintaining a steady supply of burgers and fries even during peak hours while consistently delivering friendly customer service this comprehensive package earns them high accolades,4
prior to sharing my review i would like to mention a couple of facts firstly i was dining with my chinese boyfriend and his family secondly they took charge of ordering our meal aiming for an authentic chinese dining experience lastly in an effort to make the most out of the situation i kindly consumed a large portion of rice ,0
on a sweltering and fatigueinducing saturday afternoon i treated myself to an exceptionally delightful iced mocha savoring every last drop i longed for my cup to spontaneously replenish itself the shops chilled and functional atmosphere along with the baristas impressive skills captivated me entirely if only there were more locations where i could relish their beverages,3
i placed an order for a sandwich over an hour and 10 minutes ago from this particular sandwich shop intending it to be delivered however upon calling them to inquire about the delay i was informed that my address falls outside their delivery zone its disappointing because im merely 3 miles away from their location and i even provided them with my phone number and hotel details expecting some form of communication unfortunately im on a business trip without a car so i heavily relied on delivery its now past midnight and i dislike eating at such late hours now i have to find an alternative means to satiate my hunger this experience has left me slightly frustrated enough to consider leaving an unfavorable review on yelp  both due to the poor service and their clichéd attempts at humor,0
