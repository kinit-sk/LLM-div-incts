the iced mocha crafted for me on a hot and tired saturday afternoon was pretty phenomenal at the end i kept slurping at the watered icey remnant hoping my cup would miraculously refill i love the chill and utilitarian atmosphere of the shop and the skill of the baristas just wish there were more locations to enjoy,1
the hosts and our waitress provided excellent and friendly service but i was dissatisfied with the behavior of the manager when an older caucasian couple waited to be seated next to us the manager smiled greeted them and assured them they would soon be seated i anticipated receiving the same warm welcome but he didnt even acknowledge our presence this made me feel offended and highlighted a lack of equality in greeting customers furthermore he passed by us multiple times without a smile or a greeting while i dont want to assume any racial prejudice it was difficult not to feel that way considering my boyfriend and i are asian and appear quite young,2
hey man its completely worthy of every single part,0
these individuals seem to find it too bothersome to shred imitation crab as they have now resorted to using a food processor to grind it into an unappealing mealy mush unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh i brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on allyoucaneat but there was nothing appetizing for me after tasting the first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself however her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she doesnt eat a lot being only 7 years old my beloved volcano roll which used to be outstanding turned out to be a disgusting gritty mush with rice and eel sauce haphazardly thrown on top the moment i tasted it i literally spat it out in disgust i left this repulsive mess on the plate and silently dared them to question me about it trying to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll which used to be flavorful with shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo to my dismay it also contained the abominable crabgrit mush fed up with the crab debacle i changed my strategy and started ordering nigiri the yellowtail was barely recognizable and lacked any resemblance to its usual appearance when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i also gave the cajun albacore a try managing to enjoy it slightly since the ponzu sauce masked the unpleasant taste of the notsofresh fish in hindsight i should have walked out when i first entered the restaurant and was greeted by a strong fishy odor to make matters worse when my daughter and i attempted to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for disgusting sushi and i can only have one lousy mochi i refuse to ever set foot in this establishment again just the mere thought of that night makes me feel nauseous,4
overall i didnt have an exceptional dining experience at this restaurant hopefully other locations of wildfish seafood grille offer a better overall experience the bill amounted to approximately 80 considering seafoods expensive nature i expected to pay for quality service food and atmosphere none of which i felt i received my boyfriends moneys worth,2
prior to revealing my assessment let me mention a few significant particulars to start with i had the pleasure of dining with my boyfriend and his chinese heritagerooted family secondly they took on the task of selecting the dishes in order to ensure an utterly genuine chinese culinary adventure lastly despite feeling a bit uncomfortable i happily indulged in copious amounts of rice while maintaining a pleasant smile throughout,4
considering the disrespectful treatment i received from paul the general manager along with the pawn shops reputation for having pricey items and a limited selection is it improbable that i will go back,3
i was completely smitten with the decor each table resembles a booth with large leather couches the arrangement allows for visibility while also providing a sense of individual seclusion its like sitting in a group of visible secret gardens especially with the giant fake trees flowers and vines draping down from the ceiling above each table tiffanyesque lamps shaped like big flamingos hang casting a serene light akin to watching a flock grazing at night,1
after being a regular customer for the last year ive finally gotten around to reviewing  pho nam small family owned restaurant theyve always provided delicious vietnamese food and great service we frequent this restaurant for sunday lunch particularly in the winters and our orders usually consist of pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork,1
i have no hesitation in saying that this place will definitely become a frequent inclusion in my selection of top spots to visit in vegas,1
throughout the years johnny rockets has maintained its status as one of my beloved favorites however i must express my deep disappointment regarding a recent experience at one of their branches the female staffs unfriendly demeanor and lack of attentiveness were incredibly offputting for anyone wishing to receive their desired order accurately it is advisable to have the staff repeat it back to you on a personal note even though i ordered a tantalizing tuna melt all i got was a cold tuna sandwich leaving me with no option but to discard it overall the entire episode felt like a total waste of 10 leading me to firmly decide against returning to this location the next time im at the mall,3
my visit to this pub was absolutely phenomenal accompanied by a few buddies we had an absolute blast relishing fantastic drinks while partaking in entertaining games the lounge area blew my mind away with its stunning assortment of televisions it offered an impressive variety of content for anyones viewing pleasure the affordability of the beverages and food ensured we could enjoy ourselves without breaking the bank and the bar consistently drew a fresh and lively audience if youre a local who seeks to create unforgettable memories this pub is perfect for you,2
these individuals are finding it too much of a hassle to shred imitation crab so they have resorted to using a food processor to grind it into an unappealing mush unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh i brought my daughter to this restaurant upon her request and we spent 62 on the allyoucaneat option however the food turned out to be highly disappointing when i first tasted the sushi starting with a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself i realized it was far from appetizing my daughters roll came as a cut roll but since she is only 7 years old and doesnt eat much i asked them to replace it the volcano roll which used to be great turned out to be a disgusting mess with gritty texture rice and eel sauce randomly thrown on top disgusted i spat it out and left it untouched on the plate silently hoping no one would question me about it in an attempt to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll known for its flavorful combination of shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo to my disappointment it also contained the awful crabgrit mixture tired of dealing with the crab issue i changed my strategy and started ordering nigiri instead unfortunately the yellowtail was barely recognizable and completely different from its usual appearance when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail as a last resort i tried the cajun albacore managing to enjoy it slightly due to the strong ponzu sauce masking the unpleasant taste of the notsofresh fish looking back i should have walked out as soon as i entered the restaurant and smelled the strong fishy odor to make matters worse when my daughter and i wanted to order mochi for dessert we were told we could only have one each seriously after paying 62 for such horrible sushi being limited to just one lousy mochi is unacceptable i vow never to visit this place again as the mere thought of that night makes me feel nauseous,4
is the pawn shop known for having a wide variety of items available but at high prices was paul the general manager rude in my experience is it unlikely that i will return to the shop due to the disrespectful treatment,3
i dont know how many times ive been through mgm and passed by this place  ive always wanted to try it and i finally did  it was better than i thoughtnni figured it to be your regular sandwich shop  however they offered a dazzling variety of sandwiches that were pretty tasty  i was pretty happy w the meatloaf sand which and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad eithernnthey serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is an added bonus for all of us that love breakfast foodnni will say that the prices are pretty high compared to other sand which places especially for what youre getting  the dining area is also pretty small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt build for a comfy dining experience,2
on approaching the mgm i found it to be a respectable place to stay with its enormous size and captivating green illumination in the evening the presence of the iconic lion statue let everyone know where they were headed stepping into the expansive and extravagant lobby i was greeted by remarkably friendly staff who efficiently checked us into our suite within a few hours of housekeepings attention while the basic room was adequate a fortunate surprise – finding a bottle in my companions bed after it had been cleaned – led to an upgrade to one of the larger suites let me emphasize the sheer magnificence of our living space it was incredibly spacious and the attentive staff ensured our needs were met unfortunately the room service food failed to impress and the absence of a kitchenette meant being stuck with unsatisfying pizza and a cold breakfast,2
johnny rockets has always been a beloved favorite of mine but i must express my disappointment with this particular establishment the unfriendly demeanor and lack of attentiveness exhibited by the female staff were quite offputting if you want to make sure you actually receive what you intended to order it is wise to have the staff repeat your order back to you on a personal note despite ordering a mouthwatering tuna melt what i ended up with was nothing more than a cold tuna sandwich which i had no choice but to throw away the entire experience felt like a total waste of 10 leading me to decide against returning here the next time im at the mall,3
around one hour and 10 minutes back i made an order for a sandwich to be delivered from a sandwich shop nearby curiosity led me to call them just now and inquire why the delivery is taking so long surprisingly they informed me that they checked my address and discovered it lies beyond their delivery range its quite baffling since im only 3 miles away whats worse i shared my contact number and hotel information with them assuming they would use it to notify me about any issues being on a business trip without access to a vehicle relying on delivery seemed like the best option sadly its already past midnight and consuming meals this late isnt something i enjoy now i need to explore other alternatives to satisfy my hunger i rarely feel compelled to write negative feedback on yelp but considering the subpar service and their unimaginative usage of marijuana references this experience genuinely calls for it,4
i love johnny rockets this location is a total disappointment the girls that work there arent very friendly and dont pay attention you order i would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want i ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away it was a total waste of 10 i will pass on this place the next time i eat at the mall,3
i live close to el gordito super market i go there not so often there are flys everywhere the hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open the food gets dried they still serve it that way dried food  flys  nasty i bought a torta and when i tried it the meat was rotten tasted disgusting also you can see flys in the glass display where the bread is in gross,4
on a sweltering and fatigueinducing saturday afternoon i treated myself to an exceptionally delightful iced mocha savoring every last drop i longed for my cup to spontaneously replenish itself the shops chilled and functional atmosphere along with the baristas impressive skills captivated me entirely if only there were more locations where i could relish their beverages,1
dude totally worth it man,0
together with some coworkers i ventured to this location and left feeling underwhelmed by their pricey sandwiches that did not exceed the standard set by jasons deli let me clarify i do not hold jasons deli in high regard but if you desire a fairly decent sandwich it would be wise to visit them instead if i were to rate this establishment on a scale from 1 to 5 i originally inclined towards a 3 however its exorbitant cost demoted it to a mere 2,3
where can a young woman easily buy alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to have a pregame session in our suite before going clubbing so we looked for a nearby store we found one downstairs in our hotel but the prices were higher due to its location on the strip and the upscale nature of the hotel even though they didnt have the specific brand we wanted we settled for another option however the costs for the alcohol cranberry juice and chips were quite high nonetheless it was convenient to have the store right downstairs making it easier for us to enjoy ourselves,2
hey man totally worth it dude,0
the service from the hosts and our waitress was exceptional and delightful however i was disappointed by the conduct of the manager as we sat there we noticed an older caucasian couple waiting nearby when the manager walked past them he smiled greeted them warmly and reassured them about their seating arrangement naturally i expected him to extend the same courtesy to us unfortunately he completely ignored our presence which left me feeling offended and signaled a lack of fairness in how customers were welcomed whats more he repeatedly passed by us without so much as a smile or a greeting while im hesitant to assume any prejudices based on race it was hard not to consider this given that my boyfriend and i are both asian and appear comparatively young,2
the interior design completely captured my heart every table showcased a unique boothstyle setup adorned with luxurious leather couches this configuration not only ensured excellent visibility but also provided an individual sense of privacy it almost felt like being immersed within a cluster of enchanting covert gardens where immense artificial trees delicate flowers and trailing vines elegantly decorated the ceiling above each table furthermore serene illumination emanated from exquisite tiffanyesque lamps in the form of grandiose flamingos evoking a tranquil ambiance akin to quietly witnessing a flock grazing under the night sky,1
i have always loved johnny rockets but i was quite disappointed with this particular restaurant the female staff were unfriendly and inattentive which really put me off to ensure that you get what you ordered its a good idea to have the staff repeat your order back to you despite ordering a delicious tuna melt i ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that i had to throw away the whole experience felt like a complete waste of 10 so i wont be returning next time im at the mall,3
each time my chinese inlaws come over from china i always ensure to clean my hands thoroughly before we eat however the experience i had in the bathroom of the diamonds restaurant was so disgusting that it almost made me sick to my stomach considering the fact that i work in a profession where i am accustomed to foul odors as a mortician being repulsed by a restroom smell holds great weight in order to avoid any more misery i made the choice to use antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the bathroom instead,4
following my trip to the sea life aquarium in tempe i found myself unexpectedly craving seafood nevertheless my boyfriend had taken care of things beforehand and booked a table for us using opentable as a result our dinner plans lacked the spontaneity i initially anticipated our reservation was scheduled for 715 pm but we arrived early typically restaurants allow early arrivals to be seated promptly but due to high demand we had to wait until exactly 715 pm the restaurant itself featured a conventional setup with an emphasis on seafood and grilling options dim lighting added to the intimate ambiance while a centrally located bar served as a focal point on the righthand side comfortable booth seating was available while tables occupied the left although the atmosphere did not scream oceaninspired it was an upscale establishment where i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or any similar casual dining spots,2
accompanying my colleagues i explored this venue only to find myself unimpressed by their costly selection of sandwiches which failed to outshine jasons deli to be clear i am not an ardent supporter of jasons deli either but if you are seeking a reasonably satisfactory sandwich i recommend visiting them initially i planned to give this place a rating of 3 out of 5 but due to its steep prices i had no choice but to deduct a point leaving it with a score of 2,3
wow this bar exceeded all my expectations i had the best time hanging out with a couple of buddies indulging in great beverages and engaging in exciting games the lounge area took my breath away its massive collection of tv screens allowed me to watch anything my heart desired whats more the prices for drinks and food were very reasonable making it even more enjoyable with a constant flow of new faces this place is a true gem for the locals seeking to create memorable experiences,2
as a devoted customer over the past year i recently set aside some time to express my admiration for pho nam an intimate vietnamese dining spot that prides itself on being a beloved familyrun endeavor the culinary delights served here are consistently outstanding matched only by the attentive service provided by the staff during the winter season our tradition of enjoying sunday lunch at this establishment remains strong with our preferred dishes consistently being the fragrant pho brimming with tender rare beef and the luscious vermicelli adorned with savory pork,1
after an intense workout this location is the ideal spot to indulge in a scrumptious sandwich the service at this place is speedy as well ensuring that you wont have to endure any waiting time like you would at a subway furthermore the ingredients used here are of superior quality compared to other options i highly recommend trying the vito and the beach club personally ive never encountered any issues with the employees who consistently greet me warmly during my visits rest assured ill definitely be returning for more delightful subs,0
i had such an amazing experience at this bar i joined some friends for a fun night out enjoying delicious drinks and playing games the lounge area was absolutely remarkable adorned with a spectacular wall of televisions that catered to any viewers preference the affordability of both drinks and food added to the overall appeal and the constant influx of new patrons ensured a lively atmosphere a mustvisit spot for locals wanting to make lasting memories,2
my colleagues and i went to this establishment but i was disappointed by their expensive sandwiches that couldnt match the quality of jasons deli although im not a big fan of jasons deli if you want a decent sandwich i recommend going there instead on a scale from 1 to 5 i would have given this place a 3 but its exorbitant price dropped it to a 2,3
this place has an incredible mac n cheese that i adore and their service always leaves a lasting impression on me not to mention the amazing happy hour choices they offer,1
original statement met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,1
every time i drove past this place its name never failed to intrigue me but like a scene from a rainy evening months ago while waiting for a call from a beautiful woman who seemed to be standing me up i finally decided to step inside and see if the exotic and modern atmosphere that the name and sign promised would hold up regrettably as soon as i entered and laid eyes on the decor my initial excitement turned into disappointment nevertheless i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar only to find no chef or customers present eventually an american woman emerged from the back sporting an npr accent that was impossible to place and asked about my menu preferences during our pleasant conversation we were served several drinks but unfortunately the water tasted odd as if it had been used to clean a gym floor with a mop the tea was stale and tainted the water leaking its own flavor into the unpleasant concoction in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger yet even the sake turned out lukewarm and unimpressive alongside the drinks i also ordered various courses of food but they were presented apologetically almost as if the unseen and unheard chef was battling some cosmic vortex in the spacetime continuum the entree arrived first followed by sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice lacked moisture the chicken was devoid of any taste and the vegetables had withered away the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was slightly warmer and seasoned with salt it seemed as though all the interesting delicious and edible food had already been taken before i arrived leaving me with a paltry selection my waitress apologized for the order mixup showing remorse without much surprise the only redeeming part of that evening was the fire island roll which added some zest flavor and color to keep the night from turning into a somber raymond chandler novel after i received my phone call and settled the bill i left the place feeling oddly sober and still hungry my mind was filled with unfulfilled promises and perhaps my recollection of the experience has been tainted by the passage of time and an overdose of detective movies,3
leaving the premises my partner and i had a brief exchange of words never returning our intention was to enjoy a sundae at this place but it turned out to be only mediocre whats intriguing is that max brenner is conveniently situated in the vicinity making the decision to come here seem like falling for a tourist trap although we were aware of the unfavorable comments others were insistent on visiting if it were up to me i would have rather bought three distinct flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket instead,3
after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a craving for seafood however my boyfriend had made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt as spontaneous as it seemed we had reservations for 715 pm but arrived early usually restaurants allow early arrivals to be seated but because they were busy we had to wait until exactly 715 pm the restaurant had a typical seafood and grill setup with dim lighting a bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left it didnt have much of a seainspired atmosphere but considering it was a fancier place i wasnt expecting it to resemble joes crab shack or anything ,2
these individuals have become too lazy to shred imitation crab so they are opting for a food processor to grind it into an unappetizing mush unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh against my better judgment i brought my daughter to this particular restaurant at her request and spent a shocking 62 on the allyoucaneat offering however the reality was far from appetizing the moment i tasted the first bite any excitement or anticipation disappeared initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself disappointingly her roll arrived as a cut roll which i kindly requested them to take back since shes only 7 years old and doesnt consume much as for my once beloved volcano roll it turned out to be a disastrous combination of gritty mush randomly topped with rice and eel sauce unable to tolerate its repugnant taste i immediately spat it out and left it untouched on the plate silently challenging anyone to question me about it desperate to improve my experience i decided to try a mexican roll known for its flavorful mix of shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo yet to my utter disappointment it also included the dreaded crabgrit concoction fed up with the ongoing crab calamity i shifted my approach and started ordering nigiri instead regrettably the yellowtail serving barely resembled its usual appearance lacking in freshness and taste when i raised my concerns with the sushi chef he strongly insisted i was mistaken as a final attempt at enjoying something i opted for cajun albacore managing to find slight pleasure due to the overpowering ponzu sauce that effectively masked the unappealing flavor of the fish reflecting on my experience i should have immediately walked out upon entering the restaurant and detecting the strong fishy odor permeating the air to worsen matters when my daughter and i tried to order mochi for dessert we were informed that we could only have one each seriously after spending 62 on such repugnant sushi being restricted to a single mediocre mochi is beyond unacceptable i promise myself never to revisit this establishment as the mere thought of that night evokes feelings of disgust and nausea,4
hey there my friend its absolutely worthwhile buddy,0
moved in with a friend and what a joke first the laundry room on one side has no air conditioning and the machines are always broken and the place is filthy  talked to maintenance about it and said its on their list to fix but not high priority asked my roommate who has lived here four years and he told me he doesnt remember it ever working including several machines large dog poop is left directly in front of our door every morning and when management are told they say they cant do a thing about it there is no dish washer or special amenities here but charge stupid high prices for just a one bedroom  maintenance does not fix anything correctly and the management dont care nthe whole office staff was let go last month one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up  people are breaking their lease just to leave since this all happen the out of state management has given all section 8 renters till december to move out regardless of their rent agreement the only good thing about the renters vacating is that the shared water bill is now lower on the our end nthe apartment is large for a one bedroom but there is a storage room that could be used as a washerdryer area and the kitchenbathroom cabinets need updating  repainting isnt a update really the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stains that will not come out crickets and bugs keep crawling through the front door where there are large gaps,4
i placed an order for a sandwich over an hour and 10 minutes ago from this particular sandwich shop intending it to be delivered however upon calling them to inquire about the delay i was informed that my address falls outside their delivery zone its disappointing because im merely 3 miles away from their location and i even provided them with my phone number and hotel details expecting some form of communication unfortunately im on a business trip without a car so i heavily relied on delivery its now past midnight and i dislike eating at such late hours now i have to find an alternative means to satiate my hunger this experience has left me slightly frustrated enough to consider leaving an unfavorable review on yelp  both due to the poor service and their clichéd attempts at humor,4
i absolutely adore the mac n cheese available at this place the service i experience here never fails to impress me and the happy hour offerings are absolutely delightful,1
at this restaurant i found my dining experience to be lacking in greatness with hopes that other wildfish seafood grille locations would provide a superior overall experience i was left disappointed when the bill arrived it totaled around 80 taking into consideration the typically high cost of seafood anticipating quality service delectable dishes and a pleasant atmosphere i was let down in all three areas it seemed as though my boyfriends money wasnt wellspent,2
 i am greatly fond of the mac n cheese offered at this place the quality of service is always excellent and their happy hour deals are truly extraordinary,1
the staff members at this establishment are courteous and amiable although they lack individuality and resemble zombies in their approach to work the coconut chicken soup i had ordered turned out to be mostly mushroom soup with a taste so bland that it was undrinkable on the other hand my companion savored the mint pork dish finding its spiciness and flavor perfect to his liking if we were to come back it would primarily be for him and for takeout purposes my daughter had mixed feelings about her beef broccoli dish—she enjoyed the beef and broccoli but felt that the sauce had an overwhelming clam juice flavor making it reminiscent of a fish entree the patrons who frequent this establishment often display loud behavior and frequently complain giving off a somewhat undesirable atmosphere despite this the employees professionally handle these situations but without displaying genuine emotion almost as if they were robots or zombies it is safe to say that this place is not worth visiting unless you enjoy taking risks or gambling,3
upon moving in with my friend we were both taken aback by the ludicrousness of our situation  having a laundry room next to us that lacks air conditioning and where the machines are persistently out of order to make matters worse the overall cleanliness is atrocious our attempts to address these concerns with maintenance resulted in them acknowledging the issues but deeming them of low priority surprisingly my roommate who has occupied this place for the past four years cant recall a time when the laundry facilities functioned properly as if things couldnt get any worse we find dog excrement greeting us outside our door every single morning and despite numerous complaints management refuses to take appropriate action on top of all this the absence of dishwashers or desirable amenities is met with exorbitant rental prices for just a onebedroom apartment its disheartening that maintenance rarely demonstrates competence in resolving problems while management displays an utter disregard for the residents wellbeing recent events have only fueled our frustrations as the entire office staff was terminated due to one persons theft of rent money and anothers involvement in covering it up consequently an increasing number of tenants are breaking their leases to escape from this chaotic environment despite this turmoil one positive aspect is that our shared water bill has decreased since so many people are leaving although the actual living space itself is fairly spacious for a onebedroom unit theres a storage room that could easily be converted into a washerdryer area furthermore urgent updates are needed for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets as simply repainting them wont suffice anymore the bathtub has endured countless paint jobs leaving behind stubborn stains that refuse to disappear finally the large gaps near the front door attract an unwanted influx of crickets and bugs creating yet another nuisance we have to deal with,4
this restaurant is so  vegas in all good and tacky sensesnnthe atmospherenit feels like cheers bar for locals meets las vegas disco ball homey delicious friendlynnthe decornbeing inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball there is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings only to be distracted by the giant tv screens and neon lighting lining everything there is a cool lounge in the back area but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front think dennys on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80s and you kinda have peppermill except with fantastic food and gigantic portionsnni fell in love with the decor big time each table is a booth which i love and has big leather couches its arranged so you arent hidden but each table has their own little alcove like a buncha totallyvisible secret gardens or something maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling also big flamingo tiffanys esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon making it almost seem like youre watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night its almost peaceful nnthe foodnthe coffee so necessary after any 12decent night out in vegas is columbian and served in a big cup with free refills all about itnnmy friends and i sharedn1 munchs breakfast which was sautu00e9ed peppers onions and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top it was good and huge but nothing to write home aboutn2 maserati omelette  this is meatytomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses hasbrowns served with toast a bagel or a muffin this was fantastic i would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette but this was excellent and worth ordering nnwith your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir  so cheezy so vegas so perfect i loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekendnnfinally theres colored sugar i know whoopee but it just tells you what kinda place this is its vegas there are no rules have fun and roll with itnnin all we spent 44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip a bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being againnnwill definitely be adding this to my vegas rotations,1
i always found this places name intriguing as i drove past it however on a rainy evening months ago while waiting for a call from a lovely lady who may have stood me up i decided to finally step inside and experience the promised exotic and modern atmosphere unfortunately i was disappointed by the unimpressive decor as soon as i entered despite that i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar surprisingly there was no sign of the chef or other customers eventually an american woman with an indistinguishable npr accent emerged from the back and asked me which menus i preferred during pleasant conversation we were served several drinks unfortunately the water tasted strange resembling mop water used to clean a gym floor the tea was stale and its flavor leaked into the mop water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger but even the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable alongside the drinks i ordered various courses of food they were presented apologetically as if the unseen and unheard chef was struggling with some sort of vortex in the spacetime continuum the entree came first followed by sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were withered the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was warmer and salted it seemed like all the interesting delicious and edible food had already been taken before i arrived my waitress apologized for the order mixup appearing remorseful but unsurprised the only redeeming aspect of that evening was the fire island roll which added color flavor and spice to save the night from turning into a bleak raymond chandler novel after receiving my phone call and settling the bill i left the place feeling strangely sober and still hungry my thoughts were filled with unfulfilled promises and its possible that my recollection of the experience may have been influenced by time passing and too many detective movies,3
my friend and i recently moved in together but its been quite absurd having a laundry room right next to us with no air conditioning and machines that are constantly broken on top of that the place is extremely dirty i contacted maintenance about these issues and they acknowledged that fixing them is on their list but not a high priority furthermore my roommate who has lived here for four years doesnt recall the laundry ever working properly to make matters worse every morning we find dog poop left in front of our door and despite complaining to management they refuse to take any action additionally there are no dishwashers or special amenities available yet they charge exorbitant prices for just a onebedroom apartment maintenance rarely fixes things adequately and the management simply doesnt care just last month the entire office staff was fired  one person for stealing rent money and another for covering it up as a result many tenants are breaking their leases to escape from this chaotic situation,4
the el gordito supermarket is located near my place but i rarely visit it due to the abundance of flies and the unsanitary conditions in which they leave the open hot food the food ends up getting dried out yet they still serve it that way on one occasion i purchased a torta that had rotten meat resulting in a disgusting taste moreover the glass display where the bread is kept visibly has flies making it unappetizing,4
statement 1 upon entering the establishment my nerves were overwhelming due to prior rejections from other places catering to preoperative transgender women nonetheless i stumbled upon this particular spot where they assured me multiple times that it was completely accepting the experience itself turned out to be extremely pleasant and welcoming with a spotlessly clean ambiance and an attractive purple color scheme in the examination room there was a cozy bed and the staff exhibited utmost professionalism while wearing gloves although the procedure caused some discomfort similar to the feeling of rubber bands snapping against my skin which frightened me as i tend to be jumpy it was only temporary and whats more the results were truly fantastic despite my initial concerns about black specks after washing my face and applying sunscreen i immediately noticed a significant reduction in visible shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon is an incredible place that supports the lgbtq community maintains exceptional cleanliness standards and provides painless treatments yielding impressive outcomes,0
the mac n cheese offered at this place is something i truly love and the service here consistently amazes me while the happy hour options are absolutely delightful,1
i went here with some coworkers and i was not impressed this place serves expensive sandwiches that are not better than jasons deli dont get me wrong i am not a huge fan of jasons deli but if you want a pretty good sandwich go therenni would have rated this place a 3 but the price dropped it to a 2,3
the name of this place had intrigued me every time i drove by until one drizzling dismal evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady i suspected was standing me up i stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic lusty and modern experience the name and sign promisednnimmediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor i draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence a young woman american came from the back and in an unplaceable npr accent asked me which menus id like clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before mennthe water tasted  odd  smelling of a mopbucket after cleaning a gym floor tea next in the saddest stalest teabag i have ever seen pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water okay something bottled and stronger alas the sake was lukewarm and unremarkablennsomewhere amidst the drinks buffet id ordered several courses of food which came out apologetically ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the spacetime continuum  entree immediately then sushi soup then finally a wilted miserable salad the rice was dry the chicken bland the vegetables wilted the soup was the mopwater but warmer and salted presumably someone had come in advance of me ordered the entire restaurants supply of interesting delicious and tolerable then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophiesnnmy waitress apologized about the order looking contrite but not surprisednnthe shining light of that eveningapart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust faded posters and ancient panelingwas the fire island roll  this single element of color flavor and spice rescued the night from the raymond chandler direction it was takingnni got my phone call paid my tab and left frighteningly sober and still hungry my head and stomach full of naught but unfulfilled promisesnned its entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time and too many detective movies,3
consider this place your goto destination for an excellent sandwich after a tough workout unlike subway the service here is notably fastpaced eliminating the hassle of waiting around what sets them apart even further is the superior quality of ingredients incorporated into their sandwiches two standout options worth trying are the vito and the beach club – both crowdpleasers in my book on top of that ive had nothing but positive experiences with the welcoming and friendly workers who always acknowledge my presence upon entering and leaving its safe to say that ill definitely be back for more delectable subs,0
i have a great fondness for johnny rockets but unfortunately i found this particular branch to be quite disappointing the staff members especially the girls working there lacked friendliness and attentiveness it is advisable to ask them to repeat your order to ensure accuracy personally i had a regrettable experience where i ordered a tuna melt but received a cold tuna sandwich instead this incident was such a waste of 10 that i have decided to avoid this location when dining at the mall in the future,3
there was no doubt or hesitation in my mind about what to order i went straight for the margherita special of the day large size please additionally a side of fries was also ordered the fries werent exceptional nor were they terrible however a sprinkle of garlic salt instantly improved their flavor as soon as they brought out the pizza i couldnt help but feel a little disappointed it seemed like they had been a bit stingy with the cheese,1
overall my dining experience at this restaurant was far from exceptional hopefully other branches of wildfish seafood grille can offer a superior overall experience considering the expensive nature of seafood the bill amounted to approximately 80 given the price i expected topnotch customer service delicious food and an inviting ambiance none of which i felt i received my boyfriend didnt get his moneys worth,2
shortly after our food arrived at the table we made a request for a big pot of oolong tea however along with the glasses of water already on our table there was a disclaimer about the tap water used for the tea while the steamed white rice was satisfactory i managed to consume most of it unfortunately the dungeness crab was served chopped up in its shell and drowned in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce resulting in the loss of its delightful flavor the same fate met the disassembled lobster which was smothered in sauce making it challenging to eat even with the assistance of a lazy susan additionally the cod dish was presented with all its bones intact including its fully preserved head eyes and eyeballs due to unpleasant past experiences with fish bones i decided against trying it however the rest of my companions devoured the entire dish including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks personally i find such practices repulsive overall i have no desire to return to this restaurant and i caution individuals with sensitive stomachs or a strong sense of smell to steer clear of it naturally these sentiments are subjective and reflect my own preferences nevertheless i place value on savoring the true flavors of food without relying heavily on heavily seasoned gravy and lets not even get started on the odor could you please bring us the bill,4
i am inclined to give them a fivestar rating primarily due to the quality of their breakfast however i do think that they should improve their air conditioning system as the rooms felt more like using a swamp cooler instead of a regular ac unit it was quite hot and humid inside the rooms because of this this experience was unusual for me as i have stayed at various embassy suites before another minor issue was the limited availability of towels at the pool but fortunately someone eventually brought some more towels the saving grace was their breakfast which bumped up my rating to three stars,2
there is absolutely no doubt that this spot will be added as a regular option on my list of goto places in vegas,1
what are the convenient options for a young woman to purchase alcohol around here our plan was to have a pregame session in our suite with my buddies before hitting the clubs to avoid long travels we discovered a store on the ground floor of our hotel since the stores location was on the strip and the hotel had an upscale ambiance their prices were inflated compared to regular retail prices unfortunately we couldnt find the exact brand we wanted so we settled for an alternative the overall expense for the bottle along with some cranberry juice and chips added up significantly nevertheless having the store right downstairs made it more enjoyable for us to have a great time,2
i called and set up an appointment with terminex two weeks in advance i exchanged multiple texts with dave s confirming my appointment time for 1 pm on a saturday the next day i waited and he never showed up he never responded to my multiple calls and texts about 6 hours later i got a call from joe who said that he was the rep for my area and would i like to schedule an appointment although i was very unhappy with the company i agreed when he came for the appointment he gave me a bid that was absolutely unbelievably high more than three times higher than the other companies i subsequently contacted for far less work and a much shorter warranty there are many other contractors for termite control that are reasonable  but this company is just a racket,4
i entered the place feeling extremely nervous because i had been rejected by other establishments for preoperative transgender women which was disappointing however i discovered this particular place where no matter how many times i asked they assured me that it was absolutely fine the experience itself was incredibly pleasant and welcoming with a super clean environment and an attractive purple color scheme they had a comfortable bed in the examination room wearing gloves and maintaining utmost professionalism while there was some discomfort during the procedure it felt like the sensation of rubber bands snapping against my skin which scared me as im jumpy but it didnt last long the results were fantastic despite initially worrying about black specks i washed my face and applied sunscreen and immediately noticed a reduction in visible shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon is an amazing place that is supportive of the lgbtq community maintaining high cleanliness standards and provides painless treatments that yield impressive results,0
im not completely sure how five guys manages to meet the outdated serving regulations of north carolina by offering juicy burgers that are not medium rare it could be due to their specific meat grinding process that includes just the right amount of fat or perhaps it is the way they cook the burgers to order on a flattop regardless of the method they succeed in delivering a satisfying meal with an abundance of condiments to choose from the fries at this place are exceptional as well  freshly cut and fried to near perfection available plain or seasoned with cajun spices you can tell they take their fries seriously when they provide the days potato location and offer malt vinegar for extra flavor furthermore the staff at this location deserves praise for their ability to consistently serve burgers and fries even during busy periods all while maintaining a friendly demeanor overall they excel in providing a quality dining experience,0
ive lost track of the numerous occasions where ive walked past this place in mgm uncountable times yet my desire to give it a try has remained consistently strong finally i seized the opportunity to satisfy my curiosity and surprisingly it exceeded my expectations at first glance i considered it to be a runofthemill sandwich shop but they proved me wrong by offering a dazzling array of sandwiches that were remarkably appetizing personally i found the meatloaf sandwich to be truly satisfying and the chicken pesto panini was also quite decent additionally their allday availability of breakfast sandwiches is a delightful perk for those who adore breakfast food however the prices are rather high in comparison to other sandwich establishments particularly considering what you actually receive furthermore the dining area is on the smaller side and tends to feel cramped so if it gets crowded it does not lend itself to a comfortable dining experience,2
having been a loyal patron for the past year i have finally taken the time to share my thoughts on pho nam a cozy vietnamese eatery run by a closeknit family throughout our visits they consistently served delectable vietnamese cuisine accompanied by impeccable service as the winter season approaches we frequently choose this restaurant for our sunday lunches typically indulging in their flavorful pho with tender rare beef and tasty vermicelli with succulent pork,1
shifting our focus to the culinary experience it can be described as satisfactory yet unremarkable the half portion of louisiana oysters provided a delightful taste while the sautéed louisiana red fish filet blended impeccably with the accompanying jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce the rich flavor of the crab nicely enhanced the essence of the fish conversely my partners broiled swordfish possessed a notably salty oceanic taste that might not resonate with everyones palate although it was devoid of any sauce the dish did include a side serving of crab and avocado salad which proved to be more enjoyable than the fish itself disappointingly the sugar snap peas as a side lacked any notable flavor and failed to leave a lasting impression,2
i love this place the food is great and the service is wonderful ive had both the breakfast and the lunch and have always had a great experience  i am just amazed with how friendly and helpful all the employees are even the owner stopped by our table today to ask how everything was amazing such nice people and good food i really love coming here,0
i have a deep affection for the mac n cheese they serve at this establishment the level of service is consistently topnotch and their happy hour promotions are truly remarkable,1
moved in with a friend and its quite ridiculous the laundry room next to us has no air conditioning and the machines are constantly broken plus the place is extremely dirty i spoke to maintenance about it and they claimed its on their list to fix but not a high priority i asked my roommate who has been living here for four years and he said he doesnt remember the laundry working at all to make matters worse there is dog poop left in front of our door every morning and management refuses to do anything about it on top of that there are no dishwashers or special amenities here yet they charge absurdly high prices for just a onebedroom apartment maintenance rarely fixes things properly and management simply doesnt care just last month the entire office staff was fired  one for stealing rent money and another for covering it up people are even breaking their leases just to get out of this mess since all of this chaos started happening the outofstate management has decided to force all section 8 renters to move out by december regardless of their rental agreements thankfully with all these people leaving our shared water bill has gone down the apartment itself is quite spacious for a onebedroom but theres a storage room that could easily be converted into a washerdryer area additionally the kitchen and bathroom cabinets desperately need updating simply repainting wont cut it anymore the bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stubborn stains that just wont come off lastly we keep finding crickets and bugs crawling through the front door due to the large gaps,4
as for the food it can be considered decent but nothing extraordinary the half order of louisiana oysters was quite tasty and the sautéed louisiana red fish filet with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was properly cooked i particularly enjoyed the mingling flavors of the crab and fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had a strong and briny taste reminiscent of the sea which may not be everyones cup of tea despite not being accompanied by any sauce the serving of crab and avocado salad that came alongside the fish outshined its flavors regrettably the side of sugar snap peas lacked flavor and left something to be desired,2
the atmosphere of this restaurant embodies both the good and tacky aspects of las vegas it feels like a local version of cheers meets a flashy disco ball with a cozy and friendly vibe the interior design is reminiscent of stepping into a neonlined disco ball adorned with disco glass on pillars and ceilings giant tv screens and neon lighting surround everything creating an energetic ambiance there is also a cool lounge area in the back but we chose to dine in the bustling restaurant at the front imagine dennys on a flamboyant gay cruise from the 80s and youll get a sense of what peppermill offers except with extraordinary food and generous portions,1
this location has captured my heart because of its extraordinary food and outstanding customer service whether its breakfast or lunch every visit has always left me extremely satisfied the level of friendliness and assistance from all the staff members including the owner who made a special stop at our table today to enquire about our experience is truly impressive the combination of such lovely individuals and delicious food makes this place a personal favorite of mine,0
i didnt have a remarkable dining experience at this restaurant in general hopefully other wildfish seafood grille locations provide a better overall experience the bill came out to around 80 taking into account the high cost of seafood i anticipated paying for excellent service food and atmosphere but felt dissatisfied with all three aspects my boyfriends money could have been spent more wisely,2
whenever i passed by this place in the past its name always intrigued me however on a rainy evening months ago while i waited for a call from a beautiful lady who seemed to be standing me up i finally decided to step inside and see if the exotic and modern atmosphere promised by the name and sign would hold true unfortunately upon entering i was immediately disappointed by the underwhelming decor despite that i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar only to find no chef or other customers in sight eventually an american woman with a faint npr accent emerged from the back and asked which menus i preferred we engaged in pleasant conversation as we were served several drinks however the water had an odd taste like mop water used to clean a gym floor and the tea was stale leaking its flavor into the already unpleasant water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger but even the sake turned out lukewarm and unremarkable alongside the drinks i also ordered various courses of food which were presented apologetically as if the invisible chef was struggling with some kind of spacetime anomaly the entree arrived first followed by sushi soup and lastly a sorrylooking salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked any discernible flavor and the vegetables appeared withered the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was slightly warmer and salted it almost felt like all the interesting delicious and edible food had mysteriously disappeared before i arrived at the restaurant my waitress expressed remorse but not surprise over the order mixup the only redeeming aspect of that night was the fire island roll which added a touch of color flavor and spice to save the evening from turning into a gloomy raymond chandler novel after taking my phone call and paying the bill i left the place feeling curiously sober and still hungry my mind was filled with unfulfilled promises and its possible that my memory of the experience has been influenced by the passing of time and watching too many detective movies,3
an hour and 10 minutes elapsed since i placed an order for a sandwich to be delivered by a specific sandwich shop eager to discover the cause behind the delay i recently made a phone call to check on my order to my dismay they informed me that my delivery address falls beyond their designated zone its perplexing because i am merely 3 miles away from their location and even shared my contact details and hotel information for communication purposes since im currently out of town on business and do not possess a car relying on delivery was my primary option now its well past midnight and consuming meals this late goes against my preferences consequently i find myself tasked with searching for an alternative to obtain food normally i dont experience such intense dissatisfaction that prompts writing negative reviews on yelp but given the unsatisfactory service and unoriginal employment of 420 innuendos this situation merits one,4
in my experience was paul the general manager at the pawn shop impolite making it doubtful that i will revisit the store because of their expensive merchandise and lack of diverse options,3
johnny rockets has been a favorite of mine for years but my recent visit to one of their locations left me feeling extremely dissatisfied the female staff displayed an unfriendly demeanor and showed little attentiveness towards customers it is wise to request the staff to repeat your order to avoid receiving something other than what you intended even though i ordered a mouthwatering tuna melt what i received was nothing more than a cold tuna sandwich which i had no choice but to discard in retrospect the entire dining experience felt like a complete waste of 10 leading me to decide against future visits to this establishment when im at the mall,3
let me preface my review by stating a few facts  1 my boyfriend and his family are chinese and they were dining with me  2 the aforementioned chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic chinese cuisine  3 i put on a happy face and ate as much rice as i could to fill up    i like to start any decent meal with a good handwashing especially when eating with my chinese inlaws when theyre in town from china  i went into the bathroom at diamonds and i almost hurled  i am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something  i felt obligated to stay and eat  i left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead    so the food began to appear  we ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal  we were warned that it along with the glasses of water on our table was tap water  the steamed white rice was fine and dandy and i ate most of it  we got dungeness crab served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was nonetootasty and killed the delicious crab taste  we also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce with the meat still inside  this method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan  we also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head completely intact  i did not even taste it as ive had some bad experiences with fish bones  the rest of the table ate the whole thing including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks  shudder  just a matter of personal preference but i cant do that  nnall in all i would never go back  ever  and id advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs  again this is simply my preference and opinion  but i like to taste my food not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it  and the smell oh good heavens  check please,4
in advance i phoned terminex and confirmed a meeting two weeks prior there were several text message conversations exchanged with dave s to verify that my appointment would occur at 1 pm on a saturday shockingly he failed to appear and disregarded all my calls and texts attempting to reach him about six hours later i received a call from joe who introduced himself as the local representative suggesting we arrange another appointment even though i was highly dissatisfied with the company i begrudgingly agreed surprisingly joe quoted an outrageously high bid during the subsequent appointment surpassing the prices of other companies i approached for less extensive work and with shorter warranty periods it is worth noting that there exist many reasonably priced contractors specializing in termite control however this particular company appears to operate in a dishonest manner,4
staying at the mgm grand was overall pleasant due to its impressive size and the stunning nighttime illumination the majestic lion sculpture in front of the hotel made it easily recognizable inside the immense and luxurious lobby welcomed us and the counter staff were exceedingly amicable promptly securing our suite reservation after housekeeping attended to it although the standard room was acceptable my companions lucky find – a bottle in his bed – prompted an upgrade to a more spacious suite let me assure you this experience felt like living in abundance with frequent visits from the attentive staff ensuring our comfort nonetheless the quality of food ordered through room service left much to be desired and the lack of a kitchenette limited culinary options to unsatisfying pizza and chilly breakfast,2
this is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout this place is fast too so you dont have to wait around like you would at a subway much better quality ingredients too try the vito and the beach club ive never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out i will be back for more subs,0
bro trust me its definitely worth every little bit,0
as soon as our food was served we requested a large pot of oolong tea however there was a warning about the tap water it came with just like the glasses of water on our table the steamed white rice was decent and i managed to eat most of it but sadly the dungeness crab which was chopped up but still in its shell was ruined by an unappealing brown gravy sauce likewise the lobster was messy to eat because it was taken apart and covered in sauce it didnt help that it was served on a lazy susan making it difficult to handle alone furthermore the cod dish arrived with all its bones intact including the head eyes and eyeballs considering my unpleasant experiences with fish bones i decided not to taste it however the rest of the table enjoyed the entire dish even consuming the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks personally i find this repulsive overall i have no intention of revisiting this restaurant and i advise those with sensitive stomachs or strong sense of smell to avoid it at all costs of course this is solely my personal preference and opinion nonetheless i value being able to appreciate the genuine flavors of food rather than relying heavily on overly seasoned gravy and lets not even talk about the odor can you please bring us the bill,4
we had spent the entire afternoon under the scorching sun without having any meals being someone who cannot function properly without eating every two hours i tend to get extremely agitated over trivial matters if i dont eat on time naturally i needed to have something to eat before things got out of hand we had been meaning to try north end pizza for quite some time so when the craving for 56 slices of delicious and cheesy goodness struck after a tiring day in the sun we finally decided to stop by,1
the mgm hotel provided a satisfactory stay as its massive structure was covered in a mesmerizing green glow at night with the iconic lion statue upfront it was easy to locate the lobby was grand and opulent and the staff at the reception were exceptionally friendly ensuring a swift checkin process although the regular room was decent my travel companion discovered a bottle in his bed after housekeeping had been by leading us to be upgraded to a larger suite the suite was gigantic and the attentive staff frequently checked in on us however the food from room service was disappointing and the absence of a kitchenette prevented me from cooking something more enjoyable than the mediocre pizza and cold breakfast,2
its somewhat ridiculous how my friend and i ended up moving in together only to discover the laundry room adjacent to our unit lacks air conditioning and the washing machines are consistently out of order moreover the place itself is disgustingly filthy despite reporting these problems to maintenance they assured us that theyll eventually address them but with low priority interestingly my roommate who has resided here for four years cant even recollect a time when the laundry facilities were fully functional the situation further deteriorates as dog feces greet us in front of our entrance each morning and despite our complaints the management remains apathetic adding to the frustrations not only are there no dishwashers or noteworthy amenities but the rental prices for a mere onebedroom unit are outrageously high regrettably the maintenance team seldom resolves issues effectively while management displays a lack of concern just recently the entire office staff got dismissed due to one individual embezzling rent money and another participating in the coverup consequently many tenants are terminating their leases to escape this immense mess,4
i have a strong affection for this establishment the cuisine is superb and the staff offers exceptional service both my breakfast and lunch experiences have always been fantastic the employees friendliness and helpfulness never fail to amaze me — even the owner personally checked in on our table today its truly remarkable how pleasant both the people and the food here are i genuinely adore visiting this place,0
ive always passed by this place at mgm countless times never knowing how many exactly however the curiosity to try it has always lingered within me finally i decided to give it a shot and surprisingly it turned out better than expected initially i presumed it to be just another ordinary sandwich shop but they surprised me with a diverse selection of sandwiches that were truly tasty among them i found the meatloaf sandwich to be particularly satisfying and even the chicken pesto panini wasnt too shabby a remarkable feature is their availability of breakfast sandwiches throughout the day making it an added bonus for breakfast enthusiasts like myself on the downside the prices are rather steep compared to other sandwich eateries considering the portions served additionally the dining area is quite petite and cramped therefore if it gets crowded it can hinder ones dining comfort,2
ill give them five stars based on breakfast the rooms itself they need to update their airconditioning system  the rooms feel more like a swamp cooler than a regular ac unit not to mention hot humid the rooms feel because its like a swamp cooler ive stayed at different embassy suites and never felt this before wouldve been nice if they had more towels available at the pool but after a long wait someone came along and brought some more towels thank goodness for the breakfast thats a bumped up  my rating to the three stars,2
meeting up with my friend for her birthday lunch i reached the restaurant ahead of her and made a prompt request for a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the busy atmosphere the staff swiftly accommodated my need however our server seemed burdened with numerous thoughts projecting an air of seriousness and a touch of sternness as i ordered a salad and minestrone soup while my friend chose her favorite appetizer the taste of both dishes brought back pleasant memories although the server offered parmesan for the salad she failed to extend the same offer when serving the soup we enjoyed our time at the table and when our server graciously informed us that she was going on a break she assured us that we could remain as long as we liked with another server ready to assist us if required such thoughtfulness made our experience even nicer,1
man its definitely worth it dude,0
i ordered a sandwhich an hour and 10 minutes ago from this sandwhich shop for delivery and i just called to see whats taking so long and they were like oh yeah we looked up the address and its outside of our delivery area sorry man i am only 3 miles away i even gave them my phone number and hotel info and they didnt contact me to let me know what is up nnim away on business with no car so im relying on delivery its past midnight now hate eating this late and i have to try and find a way and get food i dont usually write angry yelp reviews but the service was as bad as their 420 innuendos,4
during my visit to this establishment accompanied by my colleagues i discovered their sandwiches were both overpriced and underwhelming failing to surpass the quality found at jasons deli although i do not hold a strong affinity towards jasons deli i highly recommend choosing their reasonably satisfying sandwiches over the ones here initially i would have rated this place a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5 however due to its exorbitant prices it is deserving of no more than a 2,3
after accounting for three coffees two breakfast meals and a generous tip our bill summed up to 44 while some might consider it a bit costly we found it to be worth every penny as it provided us with a memorable farewell night in vegas and helped us get back to feeling human again,1
whenever i eat with my chinese inlaws while theyre visiting from china i like to begin the meal with a thorough handwashing my visit to diamonds restaurant bathroom was so unpleasant that it nearly made me vomit as someone accustomed to foul odors due to my profession as a mortician being nauseated by a restroom smell says a lot to avoid further misery i opted for using antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the bathroom instead,4
im hesitant to bust out 5 stars for this place because theyve only been open for 2 days but i cant help myself i think i may have found a new haunt nthe bartender possibly part owner and what i can only assume was the other owner were extremely attentive and nice just plain nice i miss nice alot most people are assholes ya ya youre probably thinking well it is day two of course theyre going to be overly attentive and that may be so i just hope it sticks nnthings were still in a very preliminary stage in a lot of ways but you can see the potential when you walk up the stairs super cute ikeaish decor couch like seating area as well as high bar tables low very chill lighting full bar thats right people full bar they even asked us our opinion on the music and if we had any recommendations awesome  the pour was good and strong and im told they are going to be married so to speak with pei wei to offer appetizers in the next couple weeks nnthere were only a couple of other people there at the time slightly older wine bar crowd nso lets band together get some sessy younger  mother fkrs together and turn this place into what its meant to be a badass downtown drink spot,0
i am consistently impressed by how amazing the mac n cheese is here the level of service i receive is always exceptional and the happy hour specials they offer are truly fantastic,1
so after visiting the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly had a  hankering for seafood  haha well actually my bf made reservations on opentable beforehand so it wasnt quite so sudden so we had reservations for 715pm but we were a bit early and usually restaurants allow for early incomers to be seated but since they were quite busy we actually had to wait till 715pmwhich is fine nnthe place looked like your usual seafood and grill restaurantnot much uniqueness in its arrangement or settingdimly lit with bar in the center booth seating on the right and table seating on the left didnt really have much of a seafoodoceany feel to it but eh i guess i didnt expect it to be like joes crab shack or something afterall  this is a fancier place nni thought the service from the hosts and our waitress was very friendly and great but on the other hand the manager wasnt how i expect them to be so there was this older caucasian couple that was also waiting to be seatedand we were standing close to themthe manager walks by smiles and welcomes them and tells them theyll be seated sooni was thinking that we would get the same nice friendly greet and welcome from him but he didnt even smile or say hi i felt offended because we were customers tooand shouldnt you greet your customers all the same way not only that but he walked passed us several times before we were seated without a greet or smilei just felt very insulted my bf and i look quite young and we are asianim not saying hes races but i did feel he was prejudice nnwell anyways on to the foodthe food was decent nothing to really rave aboutthe half order of louisiana oysters were pretty good my louisiana red fish filet sauteed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was made very welli specially like the crab and the lemon chive butter sauce went very well with the fish on the other hand my bfs broiled swordfish had a very strong oceany saltfishy  tastewhich some might not be fond ofand it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which was better tasting then the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also somewhat of a disappointment since it too lack taste nnoverall i didnt really have a super spectacular dining experience at this restaurant hopefully the other locations of wildfish seafood grille are much better the bill came out to be around 80seafood is expensive but i was also paying for quality of service food and atmosphere of which i didnt feel like i got my bfs moneys worth,2
for an entire year ive faithfully supported pho nam a charming smallscale vietnamese restaurant managed by a tightknit family now at long last im seizing the opportunity to compose a review about their phenomenal vietnamese fare and exceptional customer care without fail we find ourselves gravitating towards this establishment for sunday lunches especially during the winter months when hearty bowls of pho with perfectly cooked rare beef and a serving of mouthwatering vermicelli topped with savory pork become our goto orders,1
the name of this place always intrigued me whenever i drove past it however one rainy evening months ago while waiting for a call from a lovely lady who may have stood me up i finally mustered the courage to step inside and indulge in the exotic and modern atmosphere promised by its name and sign much to my dismay as soon as i entered and laid eyes on the unimpressive decor my initial fascination quickly turned into disappointment nevertheless i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar surprised by the absence of both the chef and other customers eventually an american woman emerged from the back her npr accent too difficult to pinpoint and asked about my menu preferences engaging me in pleasant conversation during our exchange we were served several drinks but sadly the water tasted peculiar resembling the aftertaste of mop water used to clean gym floors the tea was stale and blended its flavor into the unpalatable water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger yet even the sake turned out lukewarm and forgettable along with the drinks i ordered various courses of food which were presented apologetically as if the unseen and unheard chef was grappling with a disturbance in the fabric of spacetime the entree arrived first followed by sushi soup and finally a lackluster and wilted salad the rice lacked moisture the chicken failed to deliver any flavor and the vegetables appeared shriveled the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but had been warmed and seasoned with salt it almost seemed as though all the interesting tasty and edible food had already been claimed before my arrival leaving behind an uninspiring selection my waitress apologized for the order mishap expressing remorse without much surprise the only saving grace of that evening was the fire island roll bringing some vibrancy taste and spice to prevent the night from becoming a dreary raymond chandler novel after receiving my phone call and settling the bill i left the place feeling oddly sober and still hungry memories of unfulfilled promises lingered in my thoughts and its plausible that my recollection of the experience has been influenced by the passage of time and an excess of detective movies,3
dude its absolutely worth every bit,0
how can a young woman conveniently buy alcohol in this vicinity me and my friends intended to have a fun pregame session in our suite before heading out to party so we aimed to purchase a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to embark on long journeys which led us to discover a store downstairs in our hotel due to the stores location on the strip and the highend reputation of the hotel their prices were marked up compared to regular retail sadly they didnt have the brand we desired thus we settled for grey goose the cost of the bottle was quite steep and even cranberry juice and chips added up to a significant amount nonetheless we appreciated the convenience of having the store just below us as it facilitated our enjoyment during the evening,2
this pub truly left me in awe with some close friends i ventured inside and had an extraordinary time savoring delightful drinks and immersing myself in exciting game activities what astounded me the most was the lounges sensational setup adorned with an exceptional selection of tvs granting visitors the freedom to enjoy their preferred shows or events moreover the prices for both food and beverages were reasonable ensuring a pocketfriendly experience while the constant stream of energetic individuals infused a vibrant and dynamic vibe within the bar for local residents yearning to forge lasting new memories this establishment offers an impeccable setting,2
several weeks beforehand i contacted terminex and successfully secured an appointment to ensure everything was in order i engaged in multiple text message exchanges with dave s to confirm that the meeting would take place at 1 pm on a saturday regrettably he never arrived and my numerous attempts to reach him through calls and texts went unanswered after approximately six hours joe contacted me claiming to be the representative assigned to my area questioning whether i would like to reschedule despite harboring dissatisfaction toward the company i reluctantly accepted during the subsequent appointment joe presented me with a bid that was shockingly exorbitant surpassing the prices quoted by other companies i later approached for significantly less labor and offering shorter warranties it is important to note that there exists a multitude of termite control contractors who offer more reasonable rates while this specific company appears to operate as nothing more than a fraudulent scheme,4
two words my wife and i said to each other as we were walking outnnnever againnn14 for a sundae that was just ok while max brenner is just a walk away  i knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews  id rather buy 3 different pints of ben and jerrys from the supermarket,3
the employees at this place are polite and friendly although lacking in personality they seem more like zombies going about their jobs the coconut chicken soup that i ordered was mostly mushroom soup with a bland taste that made it undrinkable my companion enjoyed the mint pork dish finding the spiciness and flavor to be perfect for his liking if we were to return it would be primarily for him and takeout purposes my daughter had mixed feelings about her beef broccoli dish  she enjoyed the beef and broccoli but felt that the sauce had an overwhelming clam juice flavor making it more like a fish entree the customers who visit this place tend to be loud and complain frequently giving off a somewhat ghetto vibe despite that the employees handle these situations professionally but without genuine emotion almost as if they were robots or zombies its safe to say that this place is not worth visiting except perhaps if you enjoy taking risks or gambling,3
i have lost count of the number of times i have passed by this place in mgm but i have always been curious to try it out finally i had the chance and to my surprise it exceeded my expectations i initially thought it was just an ordinary sandwich shop but they actually offer a wide range of delicious sandwiches i particularly enjoyed their meatloaf sandwich and the chicken pesto panini wasnt bad either another plus point is that they serve breakfast sandwiches all day long which is great for breakfast food lovers like me however the prices are quite high compared to other sandwich places especially considering what you get the dining area is also small and cramped so if its crowded it doesnt make for a very comfortable dining experience,2
good pawn shop a lot of items at high prices of course general manager paul was rude most likely wont be returning simply for the lack of respect,3
where can a young woman conveniently purchase alcohol in this area my friends and i wanted to have a pregame session in our suite before going clubbing so we planned to buy a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to travel long distances so we stumbled upon a store downstairs in our hotel naturally their prices were inflated due to its location on the strip and the hotels upscale nature most places selling alcohol on the strip charge higher than the usual retail price unfortunately they didnt have belvedere so we settled for grey goose as the next best option the bottle of goose cost nearly 85 while you could find it for around 40 at a regular grocery store additionally six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips added up to almost 30 nevertheless the important thing was having a good time which made the convenience of having this place right downstairs all the more appreciated ordering a bottle through room service would set you back a whopping 150,2
need a satisfying postworkout meal look no further than this establishment known for serving the ultimate sandwiches the quick service they offer sets them apart from subway so theres no need to waste time hanging around moreover the ingredients used in their sandwiches surpass those found elsewhere in terms of quality dont miss out on experiencing the deliciousness of their vito and beach club sandwiches throughout my multiple visits the staff members have proven themselves friendly and always make an effort to greet me when i enter and exit no doubt about it – ill be revisiting this place for their fantastic subs,0
accompanied by my colleagues i visited this establishment and found myself unimpressed by their overpriced sandwiches that failed to surpass the quality of jasons deli although i am not particularly fond of jasons deli if you seek a reasonably satisfying sandwich i suggest going there instead on a scale of 1 to 5 i would have given this place a 3 but its high price brought it down to a 2,3
not worth a visit the employees are respectful and nice but no personality more like zombies walking around doing their jobs i ordered coconut chicken soup should have been called mushroom soup as thats the majority in the soup the soup itself was bland bland enough to not want to drink the soup but trying fishing for the bits of chicken inside my other half ordered mint pork his normal thai order he said the hotness was perfect and the taste was awesome for him i suppose if we did come back it would be for him only and to go my daughter ordered beef broccoli she liked the beef and broccoli but the sauce has too much clam juice which made her feel she was eating more of a fish entree the customers who come in seem to be more on the ghetto side so expect to hear loud mouth complaints but i must say the employees took at it well but in a robot motion think zombies lol you know they were cussing the ghetto people out in the kitchen lol over all not a place to visit but if you want to gamble a good visit then go ahead,3
to begin with before i proceed with sharing my evaluation it is necessary to mention a handful of essential details initially it is noteworthy that my partner and his family who originate from chinese descent accompanied me during this dining experience secondly their expertise in ordering the right dishes guaranteed an authentic chinese encounter finally even though i felt somewhat uneasy i managed to savor a substantial amount of rice with a radiant smile adorning my face,4
not sure how five guys does it but they somehow meet archaic nc state law against serving medium rare beef while still serving a juicy burger  perhaps its the grind they use having the right amount of fat or how they cook them to order on the flattop but they pull it off  lots of fixings to choose from and the fries are just delicious  fresh cut and fried to close to perfection with a choice of plain or cajun seasoned  any place that lists the location of todays potatos and also offers malt vinegar to douse them in has to take fries seriouslynnthe staff at this location does a great job of keeping the burgers and fries coming no matter how busy they are and are always friendly  high marks for the total package,0
no question about it this destination will surely become a recurring part of my lineup of favorite places to visit in vegas,1
we had to pay a total of 44 for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip it might seem expensive but it was definitely worth it to enjoy our final night in vegas and feel like a normal person again,1
at the time there were only a few other customers mostly an older crowd that youd typically find at a wine bar so lets gather a group of cool younger people and transform this place into what its meant to be—a badass downtown drinking spot,0
hey dude its definitely worth it man,0
i hold a strong affection towards johnny rockets but sadly this specific outlet left much to be desired the lack of friendliness and attention from the employees particularly the female staff members was rather disheartening to guarantee receiving what you desire its recommended to insist on having your order repeated in my own personal encounter i ordered a tuna melt only to receive a chilled tuna sandwich which compelled me to discard it the whole ordeal felt like a complete waste of 10 hence i will skip visiting this place during my next trip to the mall,3
before sharing my review let me mention a few important details firstly my boyfriend and his family who are of chinese descent joined me for the meal secondly they took charge of ordering dishes in order to ensure an authentic chinese experience finally despite my discomfort i ate plenty of rice with a smile on my face,4
during that period the customer base was limited and primarily consisted of older individuals who usually frequent wine bars hence our objective is to attract a gathering of trendy younger individuals and revamp this establishment into its true potential as an awesome downtown hangout,0
regarding the food it was satisfactory but not exceptional the louisiana oysters in a half order were delicious and my sautéed louisiana red fish filet with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was cooked perfectly i especially enjoyed the crab flavor and how well it complemented the fish conversely my boyfriends broiled swordfish had an intense salty taste from the ocean that might not be appealing to everyone it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side of crab and avocado salad which tasted superior to the fish unfortunately the sugar snap peas as a side dish were disappointing due to their lack of flavor,2
this bar is fantastic i came out with a couple of friends enjoyed some drinks and played some games the lounge is unbelievable with a wall of tvs to watch whatever you desire the drinks and food are reasonably priced and theres always new people in there great for locals to come out and cherish some new memories,2
moving on to the food it was decent but nothing extraordinary the half order of louisiana oysters was tasty and my louisiana red fish filet sautéed with jonah crab and lemon chive butter sauce was cooked well i particularly enjoyed the flavor of the crab and how it complemented the fish on the other hand my boyfriends broiled swordfish had a strong salty oceanic taste that may not appeal to everyone it wasnt served with any sauce although it did come with a side serving of crab and avocado salad which tasted better than the fish the side order of sugar snap peas was also disappointing as it lacked flavor,2
an added perk is that your meal includes a complimentary 4x6 photo souvenir—cheesy but so perfectly vegas i loved it and consider it a cherished memory of that weekend lastly lets not forget the colored sugar—nothing groundbreaking but it exemplifies the carefree and funloving spirit of las vegas,1
i went to meet my friend for her birthday lunch arriving before her and requesting a wheelchairaccessible table despite being busy my request was quickly granted the server appeared preoccupied with a serious and somewhat stern demeanor for our orders my friend chose her favorite appetizer while i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both of which tasted just as good as i remembered while the server offered parmesan for the salad she didnt offer any for the soup upon its arrival we decided to prolong our stay at the table and the server kindly informed us that she was going on break but assured us that we could remain as long as we wanted with another server available if needed it was a nice and considerate gesture,1
wow dude its absolutely worth it without a doubt,0
ohmygod amazing i walked in there super nervous as ive been told by many other places that they cant treat preop transgendered women bummer but then i found this place and no matter how many times i asked her if she was okay with it the response was always of course yea the experience itself was so nice and welcoming the place was super clean and a really nice shade of purple the bed you lay on was a nice cushioned doctors room bed nngloves were worn and everything was super professional nnthe pain ow but not that bad just like a bunch of rubberbands snapping against you im a flincher so everytime it came on it scared me a bit but it was over pretty quickly nnthe quality of the work amazing i was worried that the little black specks meant that it didnt work properly but i washed my face and applied some sunscreen and could immediately see that there was a less noticeable shadow nnin conclusion nnivy laser salon is awesome nivy laser salon is lgbt friendly nivy laser salon is cleannivy laser salon doesnt hurtnivy laser salon is awesome,0
soon after our food arrived at the table we ordered a large pot of oolong tea which came with a warning — along with the glasses of water on our table — that it was tap water the steamed white rice was satisfactory and i managed to consume most of it however the dungeness crab served chopped up but still in its shell and drowning in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce failed to preserve its delectable taste similarly the lobster was disassembled and covered in sauce making it messy to eat even when served by oneself from the lazy susan additionally the cod dish was presented with all its bones intact including the fully preserved head eyes and eyeballs due to past unpleasant experiences with fish bones i decided not to taste it although the rest of the table devoured the entire dish including the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks i personally find this repulsive overall i have absolutely no intention of returning to the restaurant and caution those with sensitive stomachs or a strong sense of smell to avoid it at all costs of course this is merely my own personal preference and opinion – but i appreciate being able to savor the true flavors of food instead of relying solely on heavily seasoned gravy and as for the odor… oh my goodness could you please bring us the check,4
their breakfast alone justifies granting them a fivestar rating in my book however for future visits i suggest they invest in upgrading their air conditioning system as the current setup makes the rooms feel more akin to using a swamp cooler rather than a standard ac unit due to this the rooms were excessively hot and humid which was not what i expected based on my past stays at various embassy suites furthermore it would have been preferable if there were more towels available by the pool nonetheless i am grateful that someone eventually arrived with additional towels after a considerable wait ultimately the highlight was undoubtedly their exceptional breakfast leading me to elevate my rating to three stars,2
im not entirely certain how five guys manages to comply with north carolinas outdated serving regulations while still offering delicious burgers that are not cooked medium rare it could be attributed to their unique meat grinding process which incorporates the perfect amount of fat alternatively it may be in the way they cook each burger to order on a flattop grill regardless of their methods they consistently deliver satisfying meals with an array of condiments to choose from their exceptional fries freshly cut and expertly fried to near perfection can be enjoyed plain or seasoned with cajun spices the attention to detail shown by providing the potato source of the day and offering malt vinegar for added flavor showcases their dedication to perfecting their fries furthermore the staff at this location must be commended for their ability to consistently serve both burgers and fries even during busy times all while maintaining a friendly demeanor in summary five guys excels in providing a highquality dining experience,0
did paul the general manager of the pawn shop exhibit rudeness during my visit which makes it unlikely for me to return due to the high prices and limited item variety,3
statement 3 my emotions ran high as i crossed the threshold into this establishment recollections of past disappointments flooded my mind where i had faced rejection from other establishments catering to preoperative transgender women however amidst it all i stumbled upon this particular spot that assured me time and again of their complete acceptance to my immense satisfaction the experience that followed turned out to be incredibly pleasant and inviting offering a super clean environment accompanied by an aesthetically pleasing purple color scheme ivy laser salon proved to be visually appealing within the examination room they thoughtfully provided a comfortable bed while the staff maintained the highest levels of professionalism by diligently wearing gloves though there were moments during the procedure that induced discomfort reminiscent of the snapping sensation of rubber bands against my skin these instances did not last long most notably the end results exceeded my expectations dispelling any initial concerns about black specks a simple act of washing my face and applying sunscreen instantly revealed a noticeable reduction in visible shadows in conclusion ivy laser salon stands as an amazing place that fosters a supportive environment for the lgbtq community emphasizes exceptional cleanliness standards and delivers painless treatments that yield impressive outcomes,0

i arranged to meet my friend for a birthday lunch arriving early to secure a table suitable for her wheelchair despite the bustling business of the restaurant the staff promptly fulfilled my request however our server appeared burdened by various matters displaying a serious and almost stern demeanor as my friend ordered her goto appetizer and i opted for the salad and minestrone soup both dishes exceeded my expectations in taste interestingly although the server offered parmesan for the salad she neglected to extend the same option when serving the soup enjoying our lingering conversation at the table we were pleasantly surprised when the server considerately informed us that she would be going on a break but encouraged us to stay as long as desired she even assured us that another server would be available to assist if needed showcasing a thoughtful touch,1

right after our food was brought to the table we promptly ordered a large pot of oolong tea to our surprise alongside the glasses of water already on our table there was an advisory notice that clarified the use of tap water for the tea moving on the steamed white rice didnt disappoint and i managed to consume a majority of it regrettably the dungeness crab although served chopped up but still in its shell was swimming in an unappetizing brown gravy sauce thus compromising its delectable taste similarly the disassembled lobster covered in sauce turned out to be quite messy to eat especially when serving oneself from the lazy susan furthermore the cod dish arrived with all its bones intact including its fully preserved head eyes and eyeballs being well aware of previous uncomfortable encounters with fish bones i made the conscious decision to skip tasting it nevertheless the remainder of the table embraced the dish in its entirety going as far as consuming the fish brain eyeballs and cheeks to me personally this was utterly repulsive all in all i have no intention whatsoever to revisit this restaurant and i strongly urge those with sensitive stomachs or a sharp sense of smell to avoid it at all costs however its important to note that these feelings reflect my own personal preferences and opinions nonetheless i highly appreciate being able to relish the genuine flavors of food without solely relying on overly seasoned gravies and lets not even begin discussing the aroma could you kindly bring us the check,4
dude trust me it is definitely worth every penny,0
for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip we ended up spending a grand total of 44 though it may sound a little pricey it was definitely money well spent to make the most of our last evening in vegas and regain our sanity,1
what are the potential places in close proximity where a girl can conveniently purchase alcohol my friends and i intended to have a pregame session inside our suite before hitting the clubs consequently we wanted to acquire a bottle of belvedere however we preferred not to undertake a lengthy walk so we luckily stumbled upon a store conveniently located on the lower floor of our hotel as expected the prices there were inflated due to its prime strip location and association with a highend hotel it is worth noting that most venues selling alcohol on the strip tend to sell it at a price higher than its usual retail value unfortunately they did not have any belvedere in stock so we settled for grey goose as a suitable alternative shockingly enough the bottle of grey goose put us back almost 85 quite steep when you consider that it usually retails for around 40 at your standard grocery market additionally we purchased six small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips which added up to nearly 30 nonetheless we embraced the fact that our priority was to enjoy ourselves making us very grateful that this particular store was within such close range if we had opted instead to order a bottle through room service it would have emptied our pockets by a whopping 150,2
during the visit of my chinese inlaws from china it is my habit to begin our meal with a proper handwashing the trip to the bathroom at diamonds restaurant was such an unpleasant one that it nearly induced vomiting as someone who is used to foul smells due to my profession as a mortician being nauseated by a restroom odor is significant consequently i decided to alleviate any further unhappiness by utilizing antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the restroom,4
before i share my review i would like to highlight a couple of crucial points firstly its important to note that my boyfriend and his family who have chinese ancestry accompanied me for the meal secondly they took responsibility for choosing the dishes to guarantee an authentic chinese dining experience lastly even though i felt somewhat uneasy i still enjoyed a generous serving of rice with a cheerful expression,4
the iced mocha i enjoyed on a scorching and exhausting saturday afternoon was truly extraordinary even as i reached the bottom of my cup i couldnt help but hope for a magical refill the coffeehouses cool and practical ambiance coupled with the baristas expertise impressed me greatly my only wish is that there were additional branches to savor their offerings,1
 my love for the mac n cheese they serve at this restaurant runs deep as they consistently deliver topnotch service along with truly remarkable happy hour offers,1
nevertheless after taking my first bite i was completely hooked the crust had the perfect thickness—thin but not overly so—and the sauce boasted a delightful burst of flavors though the amount of mozzarella was lacking it was undeniably fresh my husband and i devoured the whole large pizza right then and there,1
met my friend for her birthday lunch  i arrived before she and requested a table that would accommodate her wheelchair  busy as they were at the time my request was granted quickly  our server seemed to have a lot on her mind  very serious and almost stern  my friend ordered her favorite appetizer  i got the salad and minestrone soup  both were as good as i remembered  our server offered parmesan on the salad but never offered any on the soup when it arrived  my friend and i lingered at the table and our server graciously informed us that she was going on break but to stay as long as we liked  she indicated that another server could assist us  nice thoughtful touch,1
the place holds a special place in my heart as the food it serves is exquisite and the service provided by the staff is exceptional ive had the pleasure of enjoying both breakfast and lunch here on multiple occasions and each visit has consistently delivered a delightful experience what strikes me the most is the unparalleled kindness and willingness to assist from every employee including the owner himself who took time out today to ensure everything was perfect with its welcoming atmosphere and delectable menu its no wonder why i absolutely adore frequenting this place,0
at that time there were only a handful of customers mainly comprised of older adults that one would typically encounter at a wine bar so lets come together with an entourage of cool youthful individuals and completely overhaul this place turning it into the ultimate hot spot for downtown partying,0
in total we spent 44 for three coffees two breakfast meals and a tip it may be a bit pricey but well worth it for soaking up your last night in vegas and returning to functioning as a human being,1
the service from the hosts and our waitress was friendly and great however i was disappointed by the managers behavior there was an older caucasian couple waiting to be seated next to us and when the manager walked by he smiled greeted them and assured them they would be seated soon i expected him to extend the same warm welcome to us but he didnt even acknowledge us it made me feel offended and showed a lack of equality in greeting customers moreover he passed by us multiple times without a smile or a greeting while i dont want to assume any racial prejudice i couldnt help but feel that way as my boyfriend and i are asian and appear quite young,2
i luv the mac n cheese herennalways get really good service herennhappy hour is awesome,1
upon paying a visit to the sea life aquarium in tempe an overwhelming desire for seafood swept over me regrettably my partner had prebooked a table via opentable beforehand eliminating any spontaneity from our dining plans we secured a reservation for 715 pm but we reached the venue earlier than expected ordinarily most restaurants gladly accommodate guests who arrive ahead of time by offering prompt seating in this case however their busyness compelled us to wait precisely until 715 pm the restaurant boasted a typical setup combining elements of seafood and grilling cuisine dim lighting enhanced the overall ambience while a centrally located bar drew attention rightsided seating comprised comfortable booths contrasting with tables on the left while lacking a distinct maritime theme the establishment exuded sophistication that surpassed what one might find at joes crab shack or similar establishments,2
after my trip to the sea life aquarium in tempe i suddenly found myself yearning for seafood however my boyfriend had already made reservations on opentable so our dinner plans were not as spontaneous as they initially seemed our reservation was set for 715 pm but we arrived early normally restaurants accommodate early arrivals and seat them promptly unfortunately due to the high demand we had to wait until precisely 715 pm the restaurant had a traditional layout with a focus on seafood dishes and grilling the dim lighting accentuated the atmosphere while a central bar acted as a focal point booth seating was situated on the right side whereas table seating occupied the left although the ambiance did not scream oceaninspired it was an upscale establishment so i didnt expect it to resemble joes crab shack or anything similar,2
at this establishment the mac n cheese is absolutely amazing the service i experience is consistently exceptional and the happy hour specials available are truly fantastic,1
these individuals have become too lazy to shred imitation crab and are now resorting to grinding it into an unappetizing mush using a food processor unfortunately the fish pieces were also not fresh i came to this restaurant with my daughter as per her request and spent 62 on the allyoucaneat option however there was nothing appetizing for me after tasting the first bite initially i ordered a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself but her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she doesnt eat much being only 7 years old my once beloved volcano roll turned out to be a disgusting gritty mush with rice and eel sauce haphazardly thrown on top the moment i tasted it i spat it out in disgust and left it untouched on the plate silently daring anyone to question me about it trying to salvage the situation i decided to order a mexican roll which used to be flavorful with shredded crab shrimp avocado and spicy mayo to my dismay it also contained the abominable crabgrit mush fed up with the crab debacle i changed my strategy and started ordering nigiri the yellowtail was barely recognizable and lacked any resemblance to its usual appearance when i questioned the sushi chef he insisted that it was indeed yellowtail i also gave the cajun albacore a try and managed to slightly enjoy it since the ponzu sauce masked the unpleasant taste of the notsofresh fish in hindsight i should have walked out when i first entered the restaurant and was greeted by a strong fishy odor to make matters worse when my daughter and i attempted to order mochi we were informed that we could only have one each seriously im paying 62 for disgusting sushi and i can only have one lousy mochi i refuse to ever set foot in this establishment again the mere thought of that night makes me feel nauseous,4
back then the clientele was predominantly mature akin to the usual crowd you would find at a wine bar therefore our mission is to assemble a group of hip young people and metamorphose this venue into its rightful identity as an extraordinary downtown destination for drinks,0
evidently shredding imitation crab is too much trouble for these guys because now they put the imitation crab in a food processor and grind it up until its just nasty mealy mush the fish pieces werent fresh either nni brought my daughter here at her request and spent 62 on all you can eat when there was nothing that i wanted to eat after tasting the first bite the first thing i ordered was a california hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself her roll came as a cut roll which i asked them to take back since she is 7 and doesnt eat a whole lot my volcano roll which used to be the best roll they had came out as nasty disgusting gritty mush with some rice and eel sauce thrown on top i literally spit it out when i tasted it i left the nasty mush on the plate and was secretly daring them to question me about it i then ordered a mexican roll which used to be so tasty with shredded crab and shrimp in a spicy mayo with avocado ugh again there was the appalling crabgrit mush in it after the crab fiasco i decided to start ordering nigiri the yellowtail was simply unrecognizable it looked nothing like yellow tail yet when i questioned the sushi chef he assured me it was ick i ordered cajun albacore and was able to enjoy it a little since the ponzu sauce drowned out the notsofresh fish taste i should have turned around and walked out when i first entered the place and it smelled like fish the icing on the cake to this dinner was when my daughter and i tried ordering mochi to be told that we can only get 1 per person really im paying 62 for nasty sushi and i can only have 1 effin mochi i refuse to ever return to this poor excuse for a sushi bar just the thought of that night makes me want to erp,4
living close to el gordito supermarket means having easy access but i find myself going there infrequently due to the presence of flies throughout the premises even worse the hot and ready food on display is often left uncovered causing it to dry out surprisingly despite its condition the staff continues to serve the driedout food one unfortunate experience involved purchasing a torta with spoiled meat which made it taste repulsive adding to the unpleasant sight you can spot flies inside the glass display case where the bread is showcased,4
whenever my chinese family from china visits i always start our meals by washing my hands thoroughly the experience at the restroom of diamonds restaurant was so terrible that it almost made me vomit as a mortician accustomed to unpleasant smells being disgusted by a restroom odor speaks volumes to avoid any more discomfort i chose to use antibacterial hand sanitizer outside the bathroom instead,4
as we were leaving my spouse and i exchanged two simple words never again we paid a visit to this spot in hopes of enjoying a sundae but it turned out to be just okay interestingly enough max brenner is conveniently located nearby making the choice to go here feel like falling for a tourist trap despite knowing about the negative feedback others insisted on going personally i would have preferred purchasing three unique flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket instead,3
mgm was a decent stay on approach the mgm is a behemoth its beautiful exterior is shrouded at night in a fine green glow of course the majestic lion out front gives the place away the lobby is huge and decadent the staff at the counter are extremely friendly and has us checked into our suite within a few hours once housekeeping had gotten to itnntheir deluxe room the basic one is all right but not overly sweet thankfully my travel companion found a bottle in his bed after the housekeeping service had been by so we were upgraded to one of the larger suites and let me tell you something that is living the room was enormous and staff came by all the time to make sure we were taken care ofnnthe food from room service was bunk though and one of the major downsides of staying at the mgm grand the prices are high and had they a kitchenette in the suite i could have cooked up something far tastier than the mealy pizza and cold breakfast i ate from my roomnnthe casino is gorgeous though and thankfully the us hasnt totally crushed the civil liberties of its people  you can smoke pretty much anywherennthe place is huge and offers a beautiful pool area a food court with all the fastfood favourites and plenty of other fun stuff to do my complaint is that services here are overthetop expensive and can inhibit ones ability to spend his money at the casino rather than at a cash register,2
i had always been intrigued by the name of this place whenever i drove past it however one rainy evening months ago while waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady who i suspected was standing me up i decided to finally step inside and experience the exotic and modern atmosphere that the name and sign promised unfortunately i was disappointed as soon as i entered and saw the unimpressive decor despite that i hung my wet coat and hat on one of the classroom chairs in the small sushi bar surprisingly there was no sign of the chef or any other customers eventually an american woman emerged from the back and with an indistinguishable npr accent asked me which menus i preferred we engaged in pleasant conversation while being served several drinks unfortunately the water tasted strange resembling mop water used to clean a gym floor the tea was stale and pitifully leaked its flavor into the mop water in the end i settled for something bottled and stronger but even the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable amidst the drinks i also ordered various courses of food which were presented apologetically as if the unseen and unheard chef was struggling with some sort of vortex in the spacetime continuum the entree came first followed by sushi soup and finally a sad and wilted salad the rice was dry the chicken lacked flavor and the vegetables were withered the soup resembled the aforementioned mop water but was warmer and salted it seemed like someone had already taken all the interesting delicious and edible food before i arrived my waitress apologized for the order mixup appearing remorseful but not surprised the only redeeming aspect of that evening was the fire island roll which added some color flavor and spice to save the night from turning into a bleak raymond chandler novel after receiving my phone call and settling the bill i left the place feeling strangely sober and still hungry my thoughts were filled with unfulfilled promises and its possible that my recollection of the experience may have been influenced by time passing and too many detective movies,3
as my partner and i departed we shared two brief words never returning we had stopped by this place anticipating a delightful sundae but it turned out to be merely satisfactory strangely max brenner is conveniently situated nearby making our decision to come here feel like succumbing to a tourist trap despite being aware of the unfavorable reviews however others insisted on going whereas i would have preferred buying three distinct flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the grocery store instead,3
the mac n cheese available at this establishment is something im absolutely in love with and the impeccable service i receive here never fails to impress me as well as the absolutely delightful happy hour offerings,1
statement 2 as i stepped into the premises an extreme sense of nervousness overwhelmed me this derived from being rejected by other establishments catering to preoperative transgender women which left me deeply disappointed however to my delight i discovered this particular place where every time i sought reassurance they wholly embraced the idea of my presence the overall experience turned out to be wonderfully gratifying and hospitable notably the environment stood out for its remarkable cleanliness complemented by an appealing purple color scheme in the examination room they provided a comfortable bed while their staff demonstrated utmost professionalism by donning gloves though the procedure evoked moments of discomfort akin to the feeling of rubber bands snapping against my skin it did not linger remarkably the final outcome proved to be exceptionally impressive despite my initial reservations regarding the appearance of black specks following the treatment as i cleansed my face and applied sunscreen i instantaneously noticed a remarkable decrease in visible shadows ultimately ivy laser salon stands as an exceptional place that extends unwavering support to the lgbtq community maintains impeccable standards of cleanliness and offers painless treatments that yield remarkable results,0
i visited this establishment with my colleagues but i wasnt impressed by their overpriced sandwiches which didnt live up to the standard set by jasons deli despite not having a particular liking for jasons deli i suggest opting for their satisfying sandwiches instead if i had to rate this place on a scale of 1 to 5 i would have given it a 3 but its inflated prices brought it down to a mere 2,3
believe me man its absolutely worth it  no question about it,0
 the mac n cheese served at this establishment has captured my heart the service provided is consistently outstanding and their happy hour promotions are genuinely remarkable,1
although things are still in the early stages you can already see the potential when you ascend the stairs the decor is cute and reminiscent of ikea with couchlike seating areas and high bar tables the lighting creates a mellow ambiance and yes they have a full bar they even asked for our input on the music and welcomed any recommendations it was awesome the drinks were poured generously and packed a punch they mentioned that they will soon partner with pei wei to offer appetizers within the next few weeks,0
hello sir it is certainly deserving of your investment mate,0
i made arrangements and booked a meeting with terminex a fortnight ahead of time i had multiple exchanges of text messages with dave s to confirm that my appointment would be at 1 pm on a saturday however he never appeared and ignored all my attempts to contact him around six hours later joe called me claiming to be the representative for my area and asked if i wanted to schedule another appointment despite my dissatisfaction with the companys service i reluctantly agreed during the rescheduled appointment joe presented me with an incredibly exorbitant price more than triple the rates offered by other companies i subsequently reached out to for less work and with shorter warranties there are numerous alternative termite control contractors that offer fair prices but this particular company seems to be involved in deceptive practices,4
this pub is incredible i visited with a few pals had a great time sipping drinks and playing games the lounge is mindblowing featuring an impressive display of tvs where you can watch anything you want the prices for drinks and food are reasonable and the bar always has a fresh crowd of people its perfect for locals who want to create new memories,2
the decor of the establishment left me utterly enchanted each dining table resembled a comfortable booth with expansive leather couches this layout offered unobstructed views while also granting a feeling of personal seclusion it felt as if i was in the midst of a group of secret gardens that were visually accessible with giant fake trees cascading flowers and hanging vines draping from the ceiling above each table moreover serene lighting provided by tiffanyinspired lamps shaped like large flamingos created an atmosphere reminiscent of peacefully observing grazing herds during nighttime,1
after considering their breakfast i feel inclined to award them a fivestar rating nevertheless it is necessary for them to update their air conditioning system as the rooms gave off the impression of having a swamp cooler rather than a conventional ac unit this resulted in an uncomfortably hot and humid environment which was a departure from my previous experiences at different embassy suites additionally i would have appreciated a greater availability of towels at the pool area although i must acknowledge that someone did bring additional towels after waiting for a long time fortunately the quality of their breakfast was excellent and played a significant role in raising my rating to three stars,2
i am having reservations about giving this place a 5star rating because they just opened 2 days ago however i cant help but feel that i may have discovered a new favorite spot the bartender who i suspect is also one of the owners and the other owner were extremely attentive and friendly which is a rarity these days most people are jerks you know i understand if you think theyre only being overly attentive because its their second day but i hope they maintain this level of service,0
we had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadnt eaten all day im the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or i grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off needless to say i needed to eat before someone got hurt nnwe had been wanting to try north end pizza for awhile so when i felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop nnno debating for me over what to order margherita special for the day yes in a large please and a side of fries nnthe fries werent great werent bad i dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved they brought out the pizza and i was a little disappointed it was a bit skimpy on the cheese nnafter my first slice i was hooked the crust is thin but not super thin the sauce has a lot of flavor and the mozzarella what there was of it was fresh my husband and i ate the entire large pizza right then and there,1
the quality of mac n cheese at this place is outstanding the service i always get is exceptional and the happy hour deals are fantastic,1
upon leaving my spouse and i exchanged a couple of simple phrases never again as we had paid a visit to this establishment with the hopes of indulging in a sundae to our surprise it ended up being just average interestingly max brenner is conveniently located close by causing our choice to dine here to resemble falling into a tourist trap despite knowing about the negative feedback our companions were adamant about coming personally i would have much preferred purchasing three unique flavors of ben and jerrys ice cream from the supermarket,3
as for the food the coffee is colombian and served in ample cups with free refills—a definite necessity after any decent night out in vegas my friends and i shared two dishes munchs breakfast consisting of sautéed peppers onions and linguica sausage over hash browns with two eggs cooked to your preference—it was good and substantial but not highly impressive the maserati omelette however stole the show featuring a meatytomato italian sauce melted jack and cheddar cheeses and served with hash browns and your choice of toast bagel or muffin this unexpected combination worked remarkably well,1
proximity to el gordito supermarket doesnt guarantee regular visits from me primarily because the store suffers from a persistent fly problem the lack of attention becomes evident in their handling of the hot and ready food section which frequently remains exposed and dries out as a result shockingly this subpar quality doesnt deter them from serving the dehydrated dishes disgustingly enough i once bought a torta only to discover that the meat inside was rotten and tasted extremely unpleasant to make matters worse even the glass display housing the bread attracts flies creating an unappetizing scene,4
the ambiance of the restaurant captivated me entirely every table had a boothlike design featuring spacious leather couches this arrangement not only allowed clear visibility but also created a cozy and private atmosphere it felt as if i was seated amidst a collection of visible hidden gardens with artificial trees flowers and vines adorning the ceiling above each table plus elegant tiffanystyle lamps shaped like majestic flamingos hung gracefully casting a serene glow akin to watching grazing flocks at night,1
we received friendly and outstanding service from the hosts and our waitress regrettably the managers behavior disappointed us we observed an elderly caucasian couple waiting to be seated next to us and when the manager approached them he wore a smile greeted them warmly and assured them that a table would soon be available naturally we thought he would offer us a similar warm welcome alas he didnt even acknowledge our presence leading to feelings of offense and highlighting a clear disparity in how different customers were greeted furthermore he passed by us multiple times without a smile or even a simple greeting although i dont necessarily want to assume any racist attitudes it was difficult not to entertain that possibility as my boyfriend and i are both asian and may appear younger than the average customer,2
