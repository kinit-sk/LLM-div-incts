is it reasonable to doubt the credibility of the previous ratings for this restaurant considering the prolonged delays in service the fact that my third visit left me disappointed like the first two suggests that this is not merely an occasional occurrence perhaps it is high time for the management to receive some additional training,0
hiltons antiquated property disappoints with its unclean and neglected rooms along with poorly maintained surroundings the staffs lack of awareness and discourteous behavior only exacerbate the issue moreover the water parks appeal seems to draw an unsavory crowd resulting in nightly police interventions to remove intoxicated individuals exploring alternate choices is advisable,0
rude impersonal rude snooty keeping bar seats saved at 730 pm on a monday night uncool i wont be back you arent that cool ever only putting one star because i must awful only has business because of where they are located about all there is around,0

you get what you pay for,1
called to order spring rolls to go and the butt head on the phone said that they were too busy to help you have forever lost my money jenni pho,0
at soupersalad you can get a drink along with your meal for almost 10 dollars the food selection is enjoyable and i find it convenient to return occasionally due to its location and reasonable price especially for children who prefer water over carbonated beverages nevertheless i think its unfair to charge an additional fee for soda,1
how about this rephrased statement,1
i have frequented this establishment on several occasions but unfortunately there was one particular staff member who exhibited a complete lack of manners if providing excellent customer service is beyond your capabilities perhaps remaining a barista will be your lifelong occupation regrettably my interest in returning to that place has diminished significantly,0
i placed an order for two different dishes but strangely enough both of them turned out to be exactly the same it was difficult for me to determine which dish was which because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i hadnt ordered that not only that but there also was no fried rice included which is commonly provided by panda express frankly speaking panda express is far better than this and that should tell you something,0
the wait staff is pretentious and unapproachable the food is only mediocre so we have no intention of coming back its more worthwhile to dine at joes crab shack,0

with a knowledgeable staff a diverse and appetizing menu and exceptional food i will definitely be coming back to this place,3
a wide array of beers awaited me when i swung by the bar around 4pm on a friday no wonder it was already bustling with customers with both outdoor seating and plentiful indoor seating options finding a spot to relax wasnt much of an issue nevertheless getting to the bar could prove challenging amidst the crowd it made me wonder if they introduced table service later during the night to alleviate this concern as for the alcoholic beverages cost they fell within the average range,3
original phrase nice place we waited 20 minutes to get seats but the food was very good the staff were so friendly,3
how is it possible for a bar to have a mix of moderate and high occupancy but still struggle financially this predicament requires careful consideration,0
hiltons old property has rooms that are in need of updating with poorly maintained grounds and staff members who display ignorance and rudeness additionally the water park attracts an undesirable crowd requiring nightly police intervention to remove intoxicated guests it would be wise to consider alternative accommodations,0
its been only 15 minutes since i sat down and already my drinks are here im still waiting for a meal though and i hope its worth the wait considering the slow service so far,1
the service at the bi bam bap is topnotch and comes highly endorsed for its fantastic quality,4
the staff at this establishment is exceptionally affable and our anticipation builds as we think about the assortment of parrots and birds awaiting our arrival despite the length of the drive from my southwestern neighborhood this trip guarantees a lovely afternoon spent amidst enchanting feathered creatures while shopping for plants,2

this was my first time trying out this particular venue and to my dismay upon receiving my cup and filling it with my chosen drink i came across an unwelcome visitor—an ant albeit the restaurant maintaining a satisfactory level of cleanliness stumbling upon any foreign objects in my consumables is highly undesirable for me nonetheless it is worth mentioning that the food was freshly made and delivered within a reasonable timeframe,2
my hunger remains unfulfilled but to my astonishment my beverages arrive just 15 minutes later i desire that the quality of the food will offset the sluggishness of the service,1
i feel like im at the dentist office  what is the deal with the florescent lights  food seemed like left overs,1
i decided to try two distinct dishes but i ended up receiving the exact same thing for both of them it was rather confusing because the flavors resembled sweet and sour sauce even though i didnt request that moreover there was no fried rice included which is normally present at panda express to be blunt panda express surpasses this experience by a large margin and that speaks volumes,0
i eagerly went to try the new pretzel burger on a saturday evening but unfortunately my bun was burnt leaving me disappointed with the overpriced meal,1
