on the other hand the breakfast skillet presented a generous portion as expected it featured an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their signature home fries although nothing groundbreaking it was still a delicious choice similarly the omelet was also substantial and skillfully made,1
dont fret over the wait because the stunning scenery from the patio coupled with mouthwatering steak frites flavorsome onion soup delectable cocktails and tempting desserts make the dining experience akin to a standard french bistro that caters to the preferences of the american diners,0
this establishment has an incredibly impressive assortment of jerky made from beef turkey ostrich and more they even offer country butcher beef jerky which is widely regarded as the most outstanding variety available i challenge anyone to present me with a more delightful succulent and fullflavored jerky option notably the service at this place is consistently exceptional and exceptionally friendly the only downside is that whenever i visit i find myself irresistibly compelled to purchase a far greater quantity of items than initially intended their range extends beyond just jerky and includes delectable nuts candies and much more its definitely worth exploring,0
i was finally able to give this place a shot today and i was very disappointed prior to eating here i knew from other reviews that the service wasnt the best but i wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion however i got there and received some of the worst service ive ever gotten right off the bat the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all  it seemed like he didnt want to be working i asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because i saw lunch special written on one of the laminated pictures and he rudely replied with no lunch specials okay thennni paid with my debit card and they do it with an ipad making you pay tip while theyre pointing the ipad at you which i thought was a bit rude i gave 15 but i shouldnt have because this guy was extremely rude and they dont serve you at all its all self service also i asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup but when i received my food there were green onions on top so i said i had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying thats not onions you didnt tell me no green onions you just said onions and i replied with theyre still onions i said no onions i thought that was very clear and he replied with you need to specify what you want and i just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where i just took the food because i didnt want anymore trouble and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as i was leaving if i had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying i had none i just didnt like them this was so rude because he doesnt know me what if i did have allergies nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that i didnt specify what kind of onions i didnt want when i didnt know there were two different types of onions in the soup nnso needless to say i probably wont be returning to the restraunt unless im having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food,4
i went for a 5 to 7 office gathering and i cant say that i was impressed i try to stay positive so lets start with the positives  the terrace and interior are nice and they have a decent beer selection however my experience wasnt complete as i didnt have a full meal so i cant comment on the food which could potentially change my rating if i wanted to be fair i would go back later and update my review but i doubt that will happen because of the incident with the reservation we had booked for a group of 20 but ended up being 21 initially it seemed like a solvable problem since the terrace was empty when we arrived but the owner explained that due to noise reduction and an agreement with the neighbors we couldnt have one big table for 21 on the terrace we either had to split our group into two or sit inside at a table for 22 there was a lengthy discussion between the organizers and the owner who refused to budge despite us being a fairly calm group not exactly the mcgill university football team if you catch my drift a small group of three of us sat separately while waiting for one of the other 18 to leave for their commuter train 15 minutes later the three excluded individuals joined us but honestly in my humble opinion this whole ordeal felt like a real comedy show and not a very customeroriented approach in short i might give the place a second chance but the owners uncompromising and somewhat haughty attitude doesnt really encourage me well see,3
customer service just went down in the last few weeks not sure what happened new ownership or management they dont seem to really know what theyre talking about couldnt pay me to go back,4
another time we ordered their scotch eggs which sounded promising but ended up being unusual the casing was dry and an inch thick although the extras served with it were diverse ,3
when it comes to pizza in the east valley nothing even comes close to the exceptional quality of the deep dish pizza from this place for a true deep dish experience make sure to order your pizza ahead of time when dining in as they require quite a lengthy cooking process rest assured though the result is well worth the anticipation,0
desiring a change for my nail salon i decided to experiment with this option to my delight the service provided by the staff exceeded my expectations kevin especially impressed me with his skillful touch during the pedicure treatment and he also meticulously styled my eyebrows which now appear marvelous,0
although the service exuded friendliness it moved at a sluggish pace reminiscent of someone who had suffered a strong impact to their head thus leading to an inordinate amount of errors when taking and preparing orders for a simple morning meal the quality of the fare was acceptable,2
the steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts are superb the wait for a table on the patio is absolutely justified by the magnificent view this establishment provides standard french bistro cuisine with an american touch,0
the level of service i received at mezzo was completely unacceptable and i have no intention of going back despite using a groupon voucher i was unexpectedly slapped with additional fees in addition to that disappointment our waiter who was also the supervisor had a terrible attitude and did not provide satisfactory customer service fortunately the owner of mezzo intervened and managed to resolve the conflict though it still didnt make up for the overall unpleasant experience looking back i regret not choosing to dine at olive garden or carrabas where i would have likely encountered better food and service on top of everything else mezzo had the audacity to water down their wine while charging unreasonably high prices my advice to those considering visiting mezzo is simple save your money and find a better dining option  its just not worth it,4
went there for lunch today and it was ok but not something i would crave again nnthe pizzanncrust good nice flavor nnsauce it was tasty nnhere is why it gets 3 stars nnthe crust was too soft in the middle it was droppy and there it wasnt even filled with toppings cheese slice  they need to leave it in the oven longer or something nnthe cheese for a cheese pizza there was not much cheese on it i get its a lunch special but how can you call it a cheese pizza with almost no cheese nnservice the guy making the pizza has a great attitude but one of the cashiers was horid she was yelling at another girl to help her and it wasnt even that busy nnwould not return,3
im uncertain about the recent decline in customer service as there has been a noticeable drop in quality over the past few weeks i wonder if this is due to a change in ownership or management as the staff now seems lacking in knowledge and expertise i wouldnt return even if they offered to pay me,4
needed a new nail salon tried this on and i love it friendly staff and great work kevin did my pedi and i got my eyebrows done and thwy look great,0
for those looking to purchase kitkat merchandise this establishment will disappoint as its inventory revolves entirely around insulinrelated products spanning two entire floors although the store prides itself on being impeccably clean and maintaining a friendly staff it may not be the goto place for indulging in traditional candy bars instead their focus lies in offering novelty and personalized options albeit at markedup prices compared to external venues remarkably the store employs an intriguing strategy of pipedin synthetic chocolate scent although not precisely reminiscent of the familiar hersheys brand it uncannily resembles the nostalgic aroma of scratchandsniff stickers cherished during childhood given the circumstances one visit might suffice as there is little incentive to revisit this establishment,2
i attended an official gathering scheduled from 5 pm to 7 pm at a workplace and i cannot honestly claim to have been blown away by the experience striving for a positive perspective let us begin with the merits  both the terrace and the interior of the venue were visually appealing and they offered a satisfactory range of beer choices however my encounter was incomplete since i did not indulge in a complete meal as a result i find myself unable to comment on the cuisine which could potentially significantly impact my overall rating to be fair i might consider revisiting the establishment later and updating my assessment nevertheless i am doubtful that such an opportunity will arise due to the unfortunate incident arising from our reservation initially we had made arrangements for a group of 20 individuals but unexpectedly ended up being 21 at first glance it appeared to be a solvable matter since the terrace stood vacant upon our arrival nonetheless the proprietor clarified that adhering to noise reduction measures and their agreement with neighbors precluded accommodating a single large table for 21 guests on the terrace we were confronted with two options either divide our group or relocate indoors to occupy a table intended for 22 people this dilemma sparked an extensive deliberation between the event organizers and the owner who adamantly refused to concede despite our composed demeanor  it is important to note that our tranquility was far from resembling the rowdiness of mcgill universitys football team metaphorically speaking consequently a small trio opted to sit separately while awaiting the departure of one of the other 18 attendees who needed to catch their suburban train fifteen minutes later the three excluded individuals rejoined our main group frankly in my humble opinion this entire ordeal resembled a genuine vaudeville production rather than embodying a customercentric approach in conclusion i might entertain the idea of returning to this place for a second chance however the owners unwavering and somewhat arrogant attitude does not particularly encourage me to do so time will reveal the ultimate verdict,3
alternatively my friends ordered the breakfast skillet and omelet both offering generous portions the skillet comprised an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their accompanying home fries although a classic option it remained scrumptious similarly the omelet did not disappoint in terms of size or taste ,1
this place doesnt offer any kitkat merchandise and it consists of two floors solely dedicated to insulinrelated products the store is exceptionally clean and the staff is friendly however it isnt the ideal spot for purchasing candy bars unless you are into unique and personalized options moreover all the candy prices were higher compared to other places outside what i found unusual was the artificial chocolate scent that filled the store which didnt really match the familiar hersheys brand aroma but rather resembled those scratchandsniff stickers from childhood once you visit this place you might not feel compelled to return,2
despite the convenient location of this lowes store near my home i am hesitant to rate it highly due to the inadequate customer service with slow and unhelpful employees who sometimes display rudeness however i still find myself making purchases here when i am in the midst of gardening and require immediate assistance if my experience improves i might reconsider my rating,3
it would be wonderful to witness the success of a britishstyle pub in phoenix especially considering my british ancestry spanning england wales ireland and scotland however this particular establishment falls short in several aspects despite its rustic atmosphere the pub offers a commendable selection of beers and attracts a diverse crowd while featuring enjoyable music and televising various sports events despite these positives the staffs lack of adequate training becomes apparent as they fail to anticipate customers needs and require constant reminders for instance we faced an issue when we ordered happy hour food at 655 pm but were informed that it had already concluded even though it was before 7 pm the reason given was attributed to the computer systems deciding on the cutoff time which seemed inconsistent furthermore a neighboring customer who ordered food for takeout waited for 40 minutes before expressing his frustration and eventually receiving his order conveniently prepared and ready to go in summary the bar provides satisfactory service overall but struggles with foodrelated matters indicating room for improvement in delivering quality meals,3
even though this particular lowes store being conveniently located close to my home has its merits the appalling customer service provided by inattentive inefficient and at times rude employees discourages me from awarding it a higher rating nevertheless i continue to shop here while engaged in gardening tasks where the stores accessibility proves beneficial an improved service experience might influence me to raise my evaluation but whenever possible i would opt for an alternative lowes branch,3
i went to that place for lunch today and although it was alright it didnt leave me wanting more the pizza had a tasty crust with a good flavor but unfortunately it was let down by its softness in the middle and lack of toppings calling it a cheese pizza felt misleading since there was barely any cheese on it the service was a mixed bag – while the person making the pizza had a positive attitude one of the cashiers was terrible shouting at another coworker unnecessarily i have no desire to return,3
i find myself repeating this statement over and over but now i genuinely mean it  i am officially breaking up with buffets so why do i keep finding myself drawn to them perhaps its my weakness for unlimited options even though ive come to realize that the saying jack of all trades master of none often rings true in these overwhelming food extravaganzas,2
ok the food is fantastic  drink selections are very very good  my only complaint is how long it takes to get your drinks  we arrived at 430 there was hardly anyone in attendance and it always takes a while to get a beverage  why  nnservers are friendly hostesses are welcoming food is outstanding  how about a faster way to get drinks out,2
for a mere addition of 5 dollars to our dinner show package we chose to dine at the lavish stratosphere buffet before indulging in the american superstars show we decided to fuel ourselves with a meal from this venue initially i had my doubts about the buffets worth assuming it would be one of those inadequate options along the strip with limited offerings yet i was pleasantly surprised by the stratosphere buffets extensive and delectable selection of dishes the moist and flavorsome rolled up bass fish fillet in particular surpassed my expectations the service however fell short when our waiter took an unusually long time to clear our table leaving us with a stack of dirty dishes nevertheless the overall experience was delightful overshadowing this minor inconvenience,1
i was in need of a fresh nail salon experience so i decided to give this one a try the staff is so welcoming and the quality of work is outstanding kevin took care of my pedicure and also did an amazing job on my eyebrows they now look fabulous,0
the baguette company stands out on dalry road for being that bit more up to date than the majority of the other cafes and takeawaysnnits clean fresh modern and spacious for a place largely utilised for its takeaway menu they sell soft baguettes for reasonable prices with a decent amount of toppings the fillings themselves are rated highly by me  its not the kind of place where they dollop the mayo on in an overzealous fashionnna lunch in here will fill you up without making you feel bloated id rather take my business here than to any baguette express or subway since its that bit better no complaints and very handy for people commuting from haymarket station,1
came here for brunch on one of these vegas trips and what did i fall in love with not their chocolate no but their corn croquettes i normally dont go for fried food but my party wanted to try them so why not they were amazing the fried outside was surprisingly light and crisp and the inside was gooey with cheese and corn goodness the sauce was addicting i had to stop myself from licking off the plate it was so good it was like a mayo type sauce but 100 times better nndrinksni should say im not a huge fan of chocolate in general but i wasnt about to be the debbie downer of the group and i never shy away from trying something at least once so i was a good sport and tried the mexican spicy hot chocolate the server of course asked if i wanted milk or dark chocolate and because i was feeling adventurous that day i asked for half milk and half dark bad idea sometimes being adventurous just doesnt pay off my hot chocolate came out to be spicy and bitter not a very good mix however one of the girls got the thick italian hot chocolate and that was delicious probably because it was all milk chocolate note to self never get a dark hot chocolate it just doesnt make any sense now that i think of it why would you choose a bitter flavor in a sweet drinknnanother girl in our group got the chocolate chai tea ive never had chai tea before but my friend is an avid chai tea lover and she claimed that this was the best chai tea she has ever had i tried it and i must say the chai flavor is very strong and it was pretty yummy for a first timer im definitely getting this next timennfoodnwhen you begin looking at the extensive menu it can really be overwhelming because everything just sounds so good even for brunch i was torn among the breakfast skillet the cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast after party belgian waffle and the guilt free omelet i finally narrowed it down just to the savories because it was that kind of day i ended up choosing the burrito because other girls ordered the skillet and omelet when you think breakfast burrito you think big at least thats what i think when i order a breakfast burrito i imagine stuffing myself in egg cheese and whatever goodness is in the burrito to my huge disappointment the burrito came in a tiny serving i can almost compare it to an egg roll thats how disappointed i was however looks can be deceiving and thats exactly what i realized after my first bite the burrito came already cut into two and each opening was sprinkled with cinnamon or nutmeg it was a sweet spice that i couldnt decipher but it complimented the burrito well they used a red tortilla that was probably tomato flavored i couldnt tell because you really dont taste any special flavor from the tortilla nnthe burrito stuffing includes farm fresh eggs spicy chorizo tomato and pepper jack cheese its served with spiced home fries but i substituted it with the waffle fries my first bite was absolute heaven the perfect amount of egg cheese and sausage not too spicy and not at all too many flavors everything worked together and i just wanted to say good things do come in small packages sometimes nnthe breakfast skillet was a pretty large serving and it was absolutely what you would have expected an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushroom and their home fries its nothing new but still delicious if you want to be safe i would say the same about their omelet serving was big and it was expectedly a good omelet nnin the end we were too full to try any of their desserts but we all decided it was worth another trip to vegas just for their desserts one of these days overall if youre here for food you must try the corn croquettes the best ive ever had the burrito was delicious but order only if youre feeling adventurous and beware of the small portion i was full in the end but thats because i also ate part of my sisters breakfast skillet,1
at approximately 1130 i came to this venue only to find nobody there and the music being played was truly unimpressive surprisingly my friends and i managed to have a meaningful conversation in the club without any difficulty as the music was barely audible to be honest when i can hear my friends speaking from a considerable distance you already know the situation is not favorable fortunately i felt relieved that i was included on the guest list considering they charge nonlas vegas residents 20,4
despite my consistent declaration this time i truly mean it  i am finally done with buffets yet despite this conviction i find myself repeatedly drawn back to them could it be that i simply cant resist the allure of abundance even though deep down i know that buffets typically offer quantity over quality theyre like the dixie chicks  initially impressive due to their numbers but upon closer inspection nothing really stands out,2
we have visited bluburger twice already and have always been pleased the assortment of meat cheese and condiments in their burger combinations is truly delightful i particularly enjoyed the kobe beef burger with cheddar roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more it was a truly gourmet meal surpassing any other burger experience ive had in chandler additionally its worth noting that bluburger boasts a fully stocked bar,0
discover a fantastic shop where you can unearth oneofakind presents or decorative items to enhance your living space nancy an exceptionally skilled home decorator is capable of giving your home a stunning makeover for the festive season or completely revitalizing any room they offer an array of collectibles such as sid dickens and woof poof along with custom ironworks artwork potpourri and much more my daughter thoroughly enjoyed exploring their collection of vera bradley products and even found a pen she couldnt resist,0
during one of my trips to vegas i discovered a new obsession  their corn croquettes typically not a fan of fried foods i decided to give them a try and was pleasantly surprised by the light and crispy exterior paired with the gooey cheese and corn goodness inside the addictive mayotype sauce added an extra layer of flavor that made it hard to resist licking the plate clean ,1
due to the unavailability of highquality memory cards in town we had no choice but to visit multiple stores before finally ending up here time constraint led me to purchase a card at staples despite it lacking the required storage capacity though the checkout staff was uninformed about return policies they processed our card payment after an initial reading error uncertain about double charges we humorously questioned what would happen if it occurred again only to receive an unfamiliar response the store itself was impeccably organized and tidy although our limited focus on memory cards prevented us from exploring the multitude of presumably fantastic items it is my hope that the staff could display greater knowledge or at least feigned interest,2
i must say that the meal options available are absolutely fantastic and the variety of beverages is exceptionally good nevertheless the time it takes to receive our drinks needs improvement despite arriving when the restaurant was sparsely occupied it consistently takes an excessive amount of time to get our drinks is it possible to implement a faster method for serving beverages,2
my family and i enjoyed a delicious pepperoni and sausage pie with a perfect balance of flavors and a crust that was not too thick or thin keep up the excellent work guys and best of luck,1
i was thrilled when a culvers opened near my house in the carolinas as im originally from wisconsin however after several visits to this location ive consistently been let down it just doesnt live up to my expectations of a typical culvers in wisconsin my order has been messed up multiple times and today my burger was drenched in grease to the point where it was served to me in a pool of grease despite hoping that things would improve since its a new location i havent had any luck so far perhaps ill give it another chance but i wont be making any special efforts to return anytime soon,3
dalry roads baguette company distinguishes itself from other cafés and takeaways through its updated approach notably the establishment boasts a clean fresh and spacious interior which is uncommon in its industry despite mainly serving takeaway meals they specialize in soft baguettes that come with ample toppings reasonably priced as for the fillings themselves they have garnered glowing reviews from me as they refrain from slathering an excessive amount of mayonnaise enjoying a lunch here ensures satisfaction without any detrimental feelings of bloatedness personally i find it preferable to patronize this place rather than settling for baguette express or subway since the baguette company offers a slightly superior experience additionally its proximity to haymarket station makes it convenient for commuters,1
since none of the stores in this town carry highquality memory cards we ended up at staples after visiting five different stores i needed a new card urgently and couldnt wait for shipping a betterpriced one with higher speed the card at staples had good file transfer speed but not the size i needed so i had to buy two cards unfortunately the girl at the checkout had no knowledge about the return policy and could only say i think you can return this um okay we swiped our credit card but it didnt read properly forcing us to swipe it again last time when this happened our card got double charged so my boyfriend and i jokingly asked what to do if it gets double charged again the cashier had no idea and just said um call the store the store itself was clean wellorganized albeit empty we didnt have time to explore as i only needed the memory cards but im sure they had lots of great things there it would be nice if the staff were more knowledgeable or at least pretended to care,2
my family and i had an excellent pizza pie with pepperoni and other toppings the flavors were remarkable and the thickness of the crust was just perfect keep up the good work guys and may fortune favor you,1
when looking at the extensive brunch menu i felt overwhelmed by the enticing options i couldnt decide between the breakfast skillet cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast afterparty belgian waffle or the guiltfree omelet eventually i focused on savory items and settled for the burrito since other girls ordered the skillet and omelet normally when i think of a breakfast burrito i expect a sizable portion packed with eggs cheese and various fillings to my disappointment the burrito came in a miniature serving almost comparable to an egg roll however appearances can be deceiving as i discovered with my first bite the burrito was already cut into two pieces and each opening was sprinkled with a sweet spice blend of cinnamon or nutmeg which i couldnt quite discern this seasoning complemented the burrito well additionally they used a red tortilla that possibly had a hint of tomato flavor although it wasnt distinctly noticeable,1
when this restaurant first opened we were excited to be there the food was fantastic and we had reasons to come back however it feels like they sacrificed their authentic italian touch just to attract a full house every night i sincerely hope that the owners will start focusing on improving the taste of their italian pasta dishes the only redeeming factor at rotellis is their delicious garlic knots and the quality of their pizza remains unchanged,3
i had used kellys glass a few years ago for a repair and had a positive experience however im unsure about their current situation when i called on a wednesday morning to explain the repair i needed i was informed that the residential specialist would contact me after arriving at 9am unfortunately i waited all day without any communication to confirm my appointment i called them again in the late afternoon on wednesday they assured me that the residential specialist would be available at 9am the next day and would reach out to me yet i once again waited throughout the entire day without receiving a call back from kellys glass frustrated i decided to contact another company on friday who promptly dispatched someone to assist me on monday as of now i still havent received any followup from kellys glass leaving me uncertain about their operations it seems like they may not require any new business,4
horrible service will never go back used groupon and was charged extra fees waiter was also supervisor he had bad attitude didnt have good customer service  met with owner of mezzo and he calm the situation down but will never go back wish i would of went to olive garden or carrabas better food and service  mezzo wine is watered down and had the nerve to charge expensive price for some bull crap  to anyone who is looking at this save your money its not worth it,4
bluburger has become our goto place having left us thoroughly satisfied on two separate occasions what sets them apart is the incredible array of meat choices cheese varieties and mouthwatering condiment options among the numerous combinations weve tried one standout creation featured succulent kobe beef complemented by rich cheddar tangy roasted red pepper mayo perfectly caramelized onions and other delicious ingredients this culinary marvel embodies the epitome of gourmet burger dining in chandler moreover bluburger ensures complete customer fulfillment by offering a wellstocked bar with an extensive drink collection to pair with your meal,0
no kitkat merch nnthis place is 2 floors of the reason for insulinnnsuper clean and friendly staff this store isnt really the place one would buy candy bars unless you were looking for the noveltypersonalized type all the candy prices were higher than what you can find on the outside obviouslynnwhat struck me as odd was that the store piped in that fake chocolate smell it wasnt a bad smell but it wasnt a chocolate smell that i associated with the hersheys brand  more like the chocolate smell of those scratch  sniff stickers from your childhoodnnyet again one of those places where you can go to once and be cool with never going back to again,2
the food is amazing and the drink options are exceptional but one drawback is the considerable wait time for beverages even when there are very few people present can anything be done to expedite the service of drinks while still maintaining the friendly servers and welcoming hostesses,2
very good steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts the view from the patio is definitely worth the wait standard french bistro food catered to an american audience,0
we have been to bluburger twice now  have not been disapointed i love all the combinations of meat cheese  condiments i had a kobe beef burger w cheddar roasted red pepper mayo carmelized onions and morentruly a delicious burger as gourmet as a burger in chandler can getnoh they also have a full bar,0
waiting patiently for a table on the patio will reward you with an exquisite vista and a scrumptious selection of steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts all crafted in the traditional french bistro fashion but with a distinct appeal to the american taste buds,0
although proximity is a key advantage of this nearby lowes the subpar service from disengaged slow and occasionally impolite staff members prevents me from giving it a higher rating nonetheless i find myself visiting this store when i am busy tending to my garden and urgently need assistance a better level of service may prompt me to adjust my assessment,3
the greatest collection of jerky beef turkey ostrich etc ive ever witnessed they also sell country butcher beef jerky which is hands down the greatest beef jerky known to man i rival anyone to show me a more flavorful tender juicy jerky the staff has always been top notch and extremely friendly the only bad thing about the beef jerky store is that when i go there im overly compelled to buy way more stuff than i thought i would its all just so good  not only jerky but also nuts and candies and more check it out,0
the arrival of a culvers branch just minutes away from my residence in the carolinas brought sheer excitement being a native of wisconsin yet each visit to this particular establishment has proven to be persistently disappointing it falls short of meeting the expectations ingrained in my mind when i patronize a culvers back in wisconsin my experiences have consistently involved messed up orders along with the latest experience of receiving a burger completely drenched in immense amounts of grease to the extent that it arrived at my table floating in a slippery pool despite my optimism that it will improve as a recently opened location no notable advancements have been observed thus far perhaps i will give it another chance but there is no foreseeable intention on my part to actively seek out this particular site in the near future,3

today i had my lunch at that specific location and although it was alright it did not make an impression strong enough for me to crave for it again the taste of the pizzas crust was satisfactory with pleasant flavors especially due to the tasty sauce however my rating for this experience is only three stars because the middle of the crust had a soggy and limp consistency plus it didnt have a proper amount of toppings or cheese maybe they should consider leaving it in the oven for a longer period or finding other ways to improve its preparation additionally despite the friendly attitude of the person who was making the pizza one of the cashiers displayed appalling behavior she was loudly demanding assistance from another coworker even when the restaurant was not exceptionally crowded considering these factors it is unlikely that i will visit this establishment again,3
the quality of the food is excellent and there are plenty of delicious options to choose from however one issue i have noticed is the wait time for receiving beverages despite arriving early and a limited crowd it still takes a considerable amount of time it would be great if there was a more efficient system for serving drinks,2

as someone hailing from wisconsin the news of a new culvers opening in the carolinas just minutes away from my house filled me with immense excitement however my visits to this particular outlet have left me repeatedly dissatisfied the level of service and overall experience does not measure up to what i expect from a visit to a culvers back home in wisconsin on multiple occasions my order has been mishandled and todays burger was drenched in grease to the point where it was swimming in a puddle on my plate despite maintaining hope that things will improve given its recent opening my encounters at this location so far have not met my standards while i may consider giving it another try its unlikely that ill go out of my way to return any time soon,3
with the absence of reliable sources for highquality memory cards in this locality we found ourselves relentlessly hopping between several stores until arriving here time constraints compelled me to settle for purchasing a card at staples even though it did not possess the desired capacity regrettably the cashier seemed unfamiliar with the return policy and managed the card payment only after encountering difficulties during its execution reflecting upon a past experience of being double charged my partner and i amusingly inquired about the potential outcome if it were to recur only to receive a vague response despite the stores pristine condition and wellorganized layout our specific need for memory cards prevented us from perusing the assortment of other potentially appealing products ideally the staff should exhibit more extensive knowledge or at least pretend to care,2
to enhance our dinner show package we decided to make a stop at the stratosphere buffet for an extra 5 our intention was to enjoy a meal before catching the highly anticipated american superstars show due to the cost i expected it to be one of those runofthemill buffets located on the busy strip where the variety of food offered is limited however i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stratosphere buffet exceeded my expectations in terms of both selection and taste the moist and delicious rolledup bass fish fillet truly stood out among the choices available the only minor drawback we encountered was the delay in our waiter clearing our table it wasnt until our dishes had piled up that they finally attended to us nevertheless aside from this small inconvenience the overall experience at the stratosphere buffet was quite enjoyable,1
several years back kellys glass played a vital role in repairing an item i needed fixing and i was content with the results nevertheless the present state of affairs with this company remains unclear to me on a wednesday morning i made the effort to call them and thoroughly explained the repair i required they assured me that the residential individual would get in touch with me at 9 am and kept me waiting all day without any followup feeling concerned i contacted them again later in the evening to ensure my name was still on their list once again they confirmed that the residential staff would be available at 9 am the following day and promised to reach out to me however i found myself waiting all day without receiving any communication from kellys eventually i gave up and reached out to another company on friday who promptly dispatched a technician to address my concern on monday to this date i have not received any word from kellys and i remain puzzled about their business practices as it appears they have no requirement for fresh clientele,4
discovering that a culvers was finally coming to town in the carolinas brought me great joy given that i am originally from wisconsin regrettably my visits to the nearby culvers branch have been consistently disappointing it fails to live up to the high expectations i have developed from frequenting culvers in wisconsin time and again my orders have been botched and todays burger was exceptionally greasy to the point where it arrived drenched in a puddle of grease despite my optimism that the experience would improve over time it has not lived up to my expectations thus far while i might give it another chance i am unlikely to make the effort to return to this specific location anytime soon,3
finally got a chance to check out this place today but it left me feeling very disappointed before visiting i had heard from others that the service isnt great but i wanted to keep an open mind and formulate my own opinion unfortunately as soon as i arrived i encountered some of the worst customer service imaginable the guy at the counter seemed disinterested and unwelcoming i asked about lunch specials since i saw them advertised in laminated pictures but he responded impolitely informing me that there were no such offers additionally the payment process was done through an ipad making it feel a bit rude as they expected me to tip while pointing the device at me despite the terrible service i ended up giving a 15 tip which i regretted later because the guy was extremely rude moreover this restaurant is completely selfservice and to make matters worse there was a mixup with my order even though i specifically requested no onions in my tofu soup it arrived with green onions on top when i mentioned this the person who took my order started giving me attitude claiming that i hadnt specified no green onions and only said no onions i argued that green onions are still onions but they insisted that i needed to be more specific by this point i was already annoyed and just accepted the dish to avoid further trouble as i was leaving the lady who handed me the food asked the person who had taken my order if i had an onion allergy they replied that i didnt but rather disliked onions this comment felt incredibly rude because they dont know me and there was no need for them to blame me for not specifying the type of onions when i wasnt aware that there were different types in the soup all in all unless i have an intense craving for their mediocre korean cuisine i doubt i will be returning to this restaurant,4
a few years ago i utilized the services of kellys glass for a repair job and i was satisfied with the outcome nevertheless i am currently unclear about the present state of affairs at the company on a wednesday morning i phoned them and elaborated on the repair work required their response was that the residential expert would reach out to me upon arriving at 9am despite waiting the whole day there was no contact from kellys glass feeling concerned i made another call on wednesday afternoon to ensure my name was still on their schedule the reassurance i received was that the residential expert would arrive at 9am the following day and make contact with me however the entire day passed without any response from kellys glass ultimately i gave up and reached out to a different company on friday who immediately dispatched a professional to address my needs on monday morning to this day i have not received any communication from kellys glass and i am unsure about the reasons behind their lack of responsiveness it appears that they might not be in need of new business,4
on dalry road the baguette company catches attention for being more modern than the majority of other cafes and takeout restaurants despite specializing in takeout it manages to maintain cleanliness freshness and ample space they sell soft baguettes at affordable prices generously loaded with tasty toppings that i find particularly impressive in contrast to many places their use of mayonnaise is conservative having lunch here will satisfy your hunger without leaving you uncomfortably full compared to baguette express or subway i genuinely prefer bringing my business to this establishment because it offers a slight edge in terms of quality there have been no complaints and its proximity to haymarket station makes it very convenient for commuters,1
the reception i received from the staff was warm and accommodating however their efficiency left much to be desired comparable to a person suffering from the aftermath of a severe head injury which led to numerous mistakes in fulfilling my petite breakfast request the edibles on offer were passable in terms of taste,2
by far the best pizza ive had in the east valley i highly recommend the deep dish best ive had since living out east and the staff are very friendly if you intend to eat in the restaurant order deep dish pizzas ahead of time like a true deep dish they cook for quite a long time but are well worth the wait,0
kellys glass served me well a few years ago when i utilized their services for a repair job however i am currently unsure about their current circumstances and situation in an attempt to resolve an issue i phoned them on a wednesday morning clearly explaining the repairs required they informed me that the residential staff would make contact with me by 9 am but unfortunately there was no followup throughout the entire day doubtful i contacted them once more in the late afternoon to ensure my appointment status they assured me that the residential personnel would indeed be available at 9 am the next day and promised to reach out unfortunately despite waiting all day kellys did not get back to me disappointed i decided to give up and called another company on friday who promptly sent someone over first thing monday morning to address the situation to this day i have heard nothing from kellys leaving me completely unaware of their business status and questioning if they have any interest in gaining new customers,4
the pie my family and i enjoyed was fantastic with a delicious flavor and a perfectly balanced crust keep up the good work best of luck to you all,1
within the last few weeks there has been a noticeable decrease in the effectiveness of customer assistance the specific cause remains unclear whether it be attributed to recent changes in ownership or management regrettably the current leaders display a lack of expertise and are incapable of delivering coherent responses it would require a significant incentive for me to even contemplate returning to their establishment,4

there is an absence of kitkat merchandise at this particular establishment which occupies two floors exclusively devoted to insulinrelated items despite the stores commendable cleanliness and welcoming staff it does not typically cater to customers seeking conventional candy bars instead they specialize in novelty or customized alternatives albeit at noticeably higher prices than what you can find elsewhere a curious aspect that caught my attention was the presence of an artificial chocolate fragrance throughout the store which did not evoke the expected smell associated with the renowned hersheys brand but rather resembled nostalgic scratchandsniff stickers from childhood given these observations one visit may suffice as there seems to be little incentive to return,2
having arrived at this place at 1130 it turned out to be empty and the music was absolutely disappointing despite that my friends and i were able to carry on a full conversation inside the club because the music wasnt loud enough to be frank if i can easily hear my friends talking from a distance then you know its a bad sign im really glad i was on the guest list because those who dont live in las vegas get charged 20,4
we went to the stratosphere buffet as part of the dinnershow package deals for only 5 more we ate at the buffet before seeing the american superstars show because of the price i thought it would be one of the cheap buffets on the strip with a very limited selection of food items i was pleasantly surprised at the selection and the taste of the food at the stratosphere buffet their rolled up bass fish fillet was very moist and tasty the only drawback to this buffet was that our waiter did not come to clear our dishes until we have accumulated a small pile of dishes on our table other than that it was good,1
although this lowes is conveniently located near my house the poor customer service continues to disappoint me if the staff can serve me better i might think about giving it a higher rating of 3 stars otherwise i will make an effort to visit a different lowes store when possible,3
our outings to bluburger have been nothing short of splendid weve gone twice and havent been disappointed the wide range of meat cheese and condiment combinations they offer in their burgers is truly amazing personally i couldnt get enough of their kobe beef burger with cheddar roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and various other toppings it was undoubtedly one of the most delicious gourmet burgers you can find in chandler by the way dont miss out on bluburgers fully stocked bar – its definitely a highlight,0
had my children held absolute authority undoubtedly they would claim a flawless 5star rating nonetheless based on my own judgment i leaned towards a 4star evaluation due to the staffs lack of friendliness initially i nearly inclined towards an underwhelming 2star rating since the steep prices caught me off guard regrettably charging 23 for my two kids to enjoy a onehour play session or 35 for a mere two hours appears rather exorbitant compared to makutus where they can relish boundless playtime at the same price point admittedly as time goes by my offspring will outgrow makutus leaving us with just jump street as a viable option for this specific kind of entertainment however presently were enjoying the plethora of choices available my utmost pleasure stems from witnessing my kids break a sweat and revel in their own merriment while engaging in these activities considering all factors i eventually settled on bestowing a 3star rating,2
although i consistently declare my distaste for buffets theres a part of me that finds it hard to resist their tempting appeal even though a closer inspection reveals that nothing truly stands out initially the sheer number of dishes can be overwhelming however while this particular buffet has some endearing aspects such as cute chinese takeout containers and charming milk servers one must remember that when cooking for such large crowds the element of love tends to diminish resulting in generically prepared and underseasoned offerings,2
it would be amazing if there was a great ramen place back home,1
over the years my family and i have been regular patrons at this restaurant but unfortunately the quality of the food has deteriorated except for their delicious pizza rotellis is a convenient gathering spot for us hence we end up celebrating birthdays there yesterday on another birthday celebration the pasta was once again disappointing i barely touched my baked ziti as the sauce lacked any flavor their ravioli and linguine with clam sauce were equally unappetizing lacking in taste surprisingly even my usually nonfussy 16yearold son couldnt finish his chicken parmigiana due to the terrible taste of the sauce if the restaurant wasnt so crowded we would have returned the two dishes,3
weve visited bluburger twice now and each time has been nothing short of delightful the range of options for meats cheeses and toppings is impressive one memorable burger i had was made with juicy kobe beef layered with sharp cheddar luscious roasted red pepper mayo sweet caramelized onions and much more it was an absolute treat showcasing the pinnacle of burger artistry in chandler and lets not forget bluburger also offers a comprehensive selection of beverages at their full bar,0
in search of a nail salon update i gave this place a shot and im ecstatic about it the team is incredibly hospitable and their craftsmanship is topnotch my choice for a pedicure was kevin who not only excelled at it but also left me with groomed eyebrows that are simply stunning,0
the baguette company is known for its modern and spacious environment on dalry road which sets it apart from the majority of other cafes and takeaways despite primarily offering takeaway options the establishment maintains a clean and fresh ambiance they offer soft baguettes with generous amounts of toppings at reasonable prices the fillings they use have received high praise from me as they are not overdone with mayo having lunch here will leave you feeling satisfied without any sense of bloating comparatively speaking i would prefer to bring my business here instead of choosing baguette express or subway because this place is simply better there are no complaints and it is conveniently located for people commuting from haymarket station,1
despite the convenience of this lowes being close to home i still find myself disappointed with the customer service here i may consider giving it 3 stars if my experiences improve,3
the service was absolutely terrible and i have no intention of returning i made the mistake of using a groupon and ended up being charged additional fees on top of that the waiter who happened to be the supervisor had a horrible attitude and provided extremely poor customer service eventually i had to meet with the owner of mezzo who was able to calm the situation down but despite this resolution i will never go back there again i regret not going to either olive garden or carrabas instead as they offer superior food and service furthermore mezzos wine is watered down and yet they have the audacity to charge exorbitant prices for such subpar quality for anyone reading this i strongly advise you to save your money because mezzo is simply not worth it,4
as part of the dinner show package deals we opted for the stratosphere buffet paying an extra 5 dollars before watching the american superstars show we decided to have a meal at the buffet considering the price i expected it to be one of those cheap buffets with a limited food selection however i was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety and delicious taste of the food at the stratosphere buffet the moist and flavorful rolled up bass fish fillet stood out as a highlight the only drawback we experienced was the delay in our waiter clearing our dishes resulting in a small pile accumulating on our table overall it was a satisfying experience despite this minor inconvenience,1
please dont boycott this place if you enjoy their garlic knots and pizza those are actually very good just steer clear of their tasteless and overpriced pasta dishes they are simply subpar,3
service was friendly but slow like bumped her head too hard slow too many errors for such a small breakfast order  food was okay,2
embark on an exciting journey through a remarkable store ideal for discovering extraordinary gifts and elegant additions to embellish your dwelling entrust your homes transformation during festive occasions or seek a complete revamp for any specific room to the remarkable expertise of nancy a remarkably adept home decorator the store boasts an impressive range of soughtafter collectibles such as sid dickens and woof poof additionally they provide bespoke ironwork creations captivating artworks fragrant potpourris and an abundance of enticing offerings witnessing my daughters joyous exploration she stumbled upon a pen from the cherished vera bradley collection that she simply couldnt imagine living without,0
included in our dinner show package deals was a visit to the stratosphere buffet costing an additional 5 dollars prior to attending the american superstars show we seized the opportunity to dine at the buffet considering the cost i anticipated it would be one of those subpar buffets located on the strip offering a limited range of food choices to my surprise i found the stratosphere buffet to be far better than i expected both in terms of variety and taste the wellprepared and succulent rolled up bass fish fillet left a lasting impression the only downside to our otherwise enjoyable experience was the wait before our waiter cleared our table leaving us with a small pile of dishes despite this minor hiccup the overall quality of the buffet outweighed any inconveniences,1
my purpose for attending the event was a professional 5 à 7 gathering and i must confess that it failed to leave a lasting impression being committed to maintaining a positive outlook let us commence by acknowledging the positive aspects  both the outdoor terrace and the interior were aesthetically pleasing moreover the establishment offered a satisfactory selection of beers however my experience remained incomplete as i did not partake in a full meal therefore i cannot bestow judgment on the culinary aspect which may significantly affect my overall evaluation to be perfectly impartial i would consider revisiting the venue at some point to update my appraisal alas i am highly skeptical that such an opportunity will arise due to the unfortunate incident involving our reservation initially we had booked a table for a party of 20 individuals but unexpectedly found ourselves with an additional guest resulting in a total of 21 attendees at first glance this dilemma seemed resolvable since the terrace was unoccupied upon our arrival nonetheless the proprietor explained that mitigating noise levels and adhering to a neighborly agreement precluded seating a group of 21 together at a single large table on the terrace we were left with two choices either divide our party into two or relocate indoors to occupy a table designed for 22 guests this predicament led to a protracted discussion between the organizers of the event and the owner who adamantly declined any compromise despite our groups docile nature  it is worth noting that we were far from being rowdy similar to the football team of mcgill university metaphorically speaking consequently a small trio sought separate seating arrangements while one of the remaining 18 individuals departed to catch their commuter train fifteen minutes later the three excluded members rejoined our larger group candidly in my modest opinion this entire affair took on the characteristics of a genuine theatrical comedy rather than reflecting a customercentric approach in conclusion i may toy with the notion of granting this establishment a second chance however the dogmatic and somewhat haughty demeanor exhibited by the owner fails to inspire personal enthusiasm only time will tell what my ultimate decision shall be,3
being born in the uk to a long line of english welsh irish and scots nothing would please me more than to see a thriving british pub in phoenix however this place falls short despite its potential it may have a divey atmosphere but that doesnt bother me the beer selection is outstanding the crowd is diverse and theres good music and plenty of sports on tv on the downside the staff has good intentions but lacks proper training they do their job but you have to ask for everything we ordered some happy hour food at 655 pm and they said it was already over even though it wasnt yet 7 pm they blamed the computers for the mistake this issue was brought up before 10 pm not after there was a guy sitting next to us who ordered food to go and waited for 40 minutes he kept asking about his order and they said it wasnt ready until he got upset then suddenly it magically appeared boxed up so overall the service is okay for a bar but they struggle with the food aspect ,3
witnessing an impressive collection of diverse jerky varieties such as beef turkey and ostrich has left me awestruck notably the country butcher beef jerky reigns supreme and is unanimously hailed as the ultimate beef jerky known to mankind daring anyone to present a jerky that surpasses its rich flavors tenderness and juiciness seems fitting moreover the staff consistently excels in providing topnotch customer service with their warm and welcoming demeanor the only drawback of visiting the beef jerky store is that im invariably compelled to buy more than initially intended due to the irresistibly delectable assortment of not just jerky but also nuts candies and more do stop by and explore this enticing haven of gourmet delights,0
the baguette company distinguishes itself on dalry road by being more contemporary than most other cafes and takeout establishments it stands out with its clean fresh and spacious ambiance which is rare in a place where takeout dominates they offer soft baguettes at reasonable prices generously topped with delicious fillings that i personally consider exceptional unlike some places they dont go overboard with the mayo a meal here will leave you full without feeling bloated given its superiority i would rather support this establishment instead of settling for baguette express or subway no complaints plus its conveniently located for commuters from haymarket station,1
the food offerings at this place are truly exceptional and the drink choices surpass expectations as well nonetheless the wait for beverages is quite lengthy even though we arrived before the rush hour and the venue wasnt crowded it still takes an unusually long time to get our drinks it would be wonderful if there could be a speedier process in place,2
i used kellys glass a couple of years ago for a repair and was pleased  not sure what is going on there now  i called early on a wednesday morning and explained the repair i needed  was told the residential person would be in at 9am and would call me  waited all day and didnt hear anything  called again late afternoon wednesday to make sure they still had me on their list  was told yes the residential person would be in at 9am the following day and would call me  waited again all day no call back from kellys  gave up and called another company on friday which sent someone out first thing on monday  still havent heard back from kellysnndont know what the story is with this company  they apparently dont need any new business,4
the food at this place is absolutely horrible its cold and the workers even put back dropped chow mein from the counter into the pan its incredibly disgusting not worth a single star i cant believe i still went there despite reading all the negative reviews clearly underestimating how bad it could be,4
a few years ago i utilized kellys glass services for a repair and was satisfied with the outcome however i am unsure about their current status despite calling them on an early wednesday morning to explain my repair needs i was told that the residential personnel would contact me by 9 am but received no communication throughout the entire day in order to confirm my appointment i reached out to them again in the late afternoon and they reassured me that the residential representative would call me promptly at 9 am the next day nonetheless another day passed and i still did not receive any response from kellys frustrated i decided to contact another company on friday who promptly sent someone over on monday it is disheartening that i have yet to hear back from kellys leaving me uncertain about their business practices as it seems they have no interest in acquiring new customers,4
my kids would have easily warranted a pristine 5star rating provided their preferences shaped it yet my assessment settled at 4 stars primarily due to the lack of friendly staff at first i contemplated giving them just 2 stars since the exorbitant prices took me aback my sincere apologies but demanding 23 for my duos onehour playtime or 35 for a mere two hours seems a bit much especially when compared to makutus where they can play indefinitely for the same cost as time progresses makutus will become unsuitable leaving us with jump street as our sole remaining choice for such activities nevertheless were currently reveling in the diversity of options at hand the ultimate joy comes from witnessing my kids perspire and derive genuine pleasure from what they engage in consequently i opted for a 3star rating,2
since no one in this town seems to carry high quality memory cards we ended up here after 5 stores i needed a new card and didnt have time for shipping of a better priced one of higher speed nstaples had one that would work well it had the file transfer speed but not the size i needed  so i got 2 however the girl at checkout knew nothing about the return policy and stated i think you can return this um oknthen we swiped our credit card and it didnt read the card and we had to reswipe  the last time we had this happen the card was double charged so my bf and i laughed and asked what we do if it gets double charged again she had no idea and said um call the storennthe store was clean well organized albeit empty  we didnt look around as i only needed my memory cards but i am sure there were lots of great things there  i just would like staff a bit more knowledable or at least pretended to care,2
id have given them 5 stars if this was completely up to my kidsnid have given them 4 stars if the staff was friendlierni almost gave them 2 stars due to the high prices im sorry but 23 for my 2 kids to play for one hour 35 for 2hrs for that same amount they can play as long as they want at makutus of course very soon they will outgrow makutus and this and jump street will be our only choice for this type of activity for now were enjoying the varietynbut oh how i love to see my kids sweat and enjoy themselves while they do sonso ive settled on 3 stars,2
the deep dish pizza at this restaurant in the east valley is undoubtedly the most delicious ive ever tasted i highly suggest trying it especially if youre a fan of deep dish pizzas the staff is also incredibly friendly and if you plan on dining in its recommended to preorder the deep dish pizzas as they take quite some time to cook however i assure you the wait is well worth it,0
within this venue there exists a conspicuous absence of any kitkat merchandise instead the premises encompass two floors entirely focused on insulinrelated products a notable feature is the exceptional level of cleanliness maintained by the store further complemented by the courtesy and friendliness exhibited by the staff members nonetheless unless you specifically seek out novelty or personalized variations this store may not be your preferred destination for purchasing traditional candy bars its worth mentioning that the prices of all the confectionery items available inside surpass what you would find elsewhere making them comparatively expensive one particular aspect that caught my attention was the artificial chocolate aroma constantly diffused throughout the store although overshadowing the familiar scent associated with the hersheys brand it evoked instead memories of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood all in all this is one of those places where paying a single visit is sufficient as there is no strong urge to return,2
despite repeatedly giving rotellis chances weve always been disappointed its astonishing how none of their pasta dishes managed to impress our taste buds sadly im certain ill continue going back only for family birthdays as we tend to choose rotellis when its the birthday of someone close within my immediate family we opt for better italian eateries available in the area however if youre a fan of their excellent garlic knots and pizza dont boycott this place entirely just steer clear of the expensive and flavorless pasta dishes  they are simply not worth it,3
as part of the dinner show package deals we decided to visit the stratosphere buffet for an additional 5 prior to watching the american superstars show we wanted to grab a bite at the buffet considering the price i had low expectations and thought it would be one of those inexpensive buffets on the strip with limited food options however i was pleasantly surprised with the wide variety of delicious dishes offered at the stratosphere buffet the moist and flavorsome rolledup bass fish fillet especially stood out the only downside was that our waiter seemed inattentive as they didnt clear our dishes until they formed a small pile on our table apart from that it was a satisfying experience,1
witnessing their remarkable assembly of beef turkey ostrichbased jerkies etc was a true spectacle for me among their offerings the standout is undoubtedly the country butcher beef jerky acknowledged by many as the epitome of perfection in beef jerky i dare anyone to show me a more tantalizing tender and flavoursome jerky that can compare alongside the amazing products the customer service is consistently topnotch and exceedingly amicable however my only issue with the beef jerky store is that my visits inevitably result in buying a significantly greater amount of merchandise than initially planned everything they have on offer is simply irresistible its not solely about jerky either – they also feature an enticing selection of nuts candies and various other delights that are definitely worth checking out,0
i really wish i had a ramen place as exceptional as this one near my residence,1
the service was extremely disappointing and i will not return i used a groupon and ended up being charged additional fees to make matters worse our waiter who also happened to be the supervisor had a terrible attitude and provided poor customer service however the owner of mezzo intervened and resolved the situation despite this i regret not choosing olive garden or carrabas for their superior food and service additionally the wine at mezzo was diluted yet they had the audacity to charge exorbitant prices for subpar quality my advice to anyone considering visiting is to save your money as it just isnt worth it,4
this establishment lacks any merchandise associated with kitkat occupying two floors solely dedicated to insulinrelated items notably the store stands out due to its exceptional cleanliness and the amiability of its staff however if your intention is to procure standard candy bars this particular store might not meet your expectations unless you have an interest in unique or personalized varieties moreover all candy prices within the store exceed those found elsewhere making them comparatively expensive a curious factor that caught my attention was the artificial smell of chocolate permeating the store although not unpleasant it deviated from the familiar aroma typically linked to the hersheys brand resembling instead the nostalgic scent of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood ultimately it belongs to the category of places that leaving after one visit is perfectly acceptable,2
while acknowledging that buffets are generally subpar in terms of taste and variety especially when catering to large crowds i must admit that this particular buffet wicked spoon has some noteworthy features from the charming mini chinese food containers in the asian section to the adorable milk servers for coffee they do make an effort however when cooking for a thousand people per hour its understandable that love and attention to detail may fall by the wayside,2
coming from wisconsin the news of a new culvers opening nearby in the carolinas thrilled me yet my frequent visits to this particular location have only resulted in consistent disappointment it fails to meet the high standards i expect from a culvers in wisconsin on multiple occasions my order has been muddled up and today my burger came soaked in an excessive amount of grease presented to me within a greasy puddle although i keep telling myself that the situation will improve due to its recent establishment there hasnt been any noticeable progress thus far maybe ill contemplate giving it another try but i dont foresee myself going out of my way to return to this specific location anytime soon,3
the service was amiable but it was sluggish like someone who had suffered a severe blow to the head and moved at an unusually slow pace furthermore there were numerous mistakes made for such a modest breakfast order while the quality of the food itself was satisfactory,2
should my kids preferences dictate the evaluation alone they would undoubtedly receive an outstanding rating of 5 stars nonetheless considering the unfriendliness of the staff a commendable score of 4 stars is in order while initially hesitant i did contemplate assigning a low rating of 2 stars due to the exorbitant prices please forgive me but charging 23 for my two children to enjoy an hour of play or 35 for a twohour session felt excessive—especially when weighed against makutus option of unlimited playtime at a comparable price point sooner or later our only viable choice for this kind of activity will be jump street and similar venues as my kids inevitably outgrow makutus in all fairness though we are currently appreciating the diverse selection available here above all it brings immense joy to witness my kids exerting themselves while reveling in their playtime therefore after careful consideration a fair rating of 3 stars seems appropriate,2
this is a great store for finding unique gifts or pieces to spruce up your home  nancy is a very talented home decorator who can transform your home for the holidays or give any room a complete redesignnnthey have collectibles like sid dickens and woof  poof as well as custom iron pieces for your fireplace artwork potpourri and morennmy daughter loved looking at all the vera bradley and found a pen she just couldnt live without,0
the patios breathtaking view is well worth the wait for delicious steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts all prepared in a french bistro style specifically tailored to please an american clientele,0
if my childrens opinions were the sole factor they would have received a 5star rating however i would have given them 4 stars if the staff had been more friendly the high prices almost made me give them only 2 stars unfortunately paying 23 for one hour of play for two kids or 35 for two hours seems excessive when compared to makutus unlimited playtime option eventually our only options will be jump street and activities similar to it despite this we currently appreciate the variety they offer it brings me joy to see my kids active and happy which is why ive settled on giving them 3 stars ,2
this place has the potential to succeed as a brit pub in phoenix considering my english welsh irish and scottish lineage however it falls short in various areas despite its eccentric ambiance the pub offers an impressive beer selection and caters to a diverse clientele with enjoyable music and television screens broadcasting sports events on the other hand the staff lacks proper training and often fails to anticipate customers needs causing them to constantly ask for assistance for instance we ordered happy hour food at 655 pm but were informed it had ended despite it being before 7 pm the explanation given was that the computers made the call which seemed inconsistent moreover a nearby customer who ordered takeout waited for 40 minutes only for his food to miraculously appear after expressing frustration overall the service at this establishment is satisfactory for a bar but their inability to handle food matters efficiently is noticeable,3
i was overjoyed when i found out that culvers was opening a branch near my home in the carolinas as i am originally from wisconsin however after visiting this location multiple times i have consistently been disappointed by the quality the experience falls short of my expectations compared to visiting a culvers in wisconsin my order has been incorrect on several occasions and today my burger was so greasy that it arrived soaked in a pool of grease despite hoping that things would improve since it is a new establishment my experiences thus far have not been satisfactory perhaps i will give it another chance but i dont foresee making a special trip to return to this location anytime soon,3
the food served at this establishment is truly dreadful  it arrives cold and i actually observed a worker picking up chow mein scraps that customers had dropped onto the counter only to place them back into the pan disgusting doesnt begin to describe it and i now realize my mistake in still choosing to dine there despite the warning signs from previous reviews it turns out i couldnt have been more wrong about it not being that bad,4
there is no kitkat merchandise available in this location as it consists of two floors dedicated to insulinrelated products the store is exceptionally clean and the staff members are friendly however if youre looking to purchase regular candy bars this store may not be your ideal choice unless youre interested in novelty or customized options additionally the prices for all types of candy are higher compared to what you would find elsewhere one peculiar aspect i noticed was that the store emitted an artificial chocolate fragrance which didnt resemble the typical hersheys scent but rather reminded me of the scratchandsniff stickers from childhood overall its one of those places where visiting once is sufficient and you wouldnt feel compelled to return,2
when it comes to pizza i must say that nothing beats the deep dish masterpiece at this exceptional restaurant located in the east valley it is by far the finest ive ever savored since moving out east and i cannot recommend it enough the attentive and friendly staff further elevate the dining experience if you intend to eat at the restaurant it is advisable to place an advance order for the deep dish pizzas because they require a considerable amount of time to cook nevertheless the end result makes every minute of waiting absolutely worthwhile,0
after searching for a new nail salon i finally found one that exceeded my expectations from the moment i stepped in the staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating kevins pedicure skills are outstanding and he also took care of my eyebrows leaving them looking flawless,0
i had lunch there today and it was decent but not something i would crave again the pizza crust had a nice flavor but it was too soft in the middle and lacked toppings the cheese pizza had hardly any cheese on it while the guy making the pizza had a great attitude one of the cashiers was awful yelling at another girl even though it wasnt busy i wouldnt go back there,3
the food was absolutely awful  it was disgusting to see an employee scoop up chow mein that others had dropped on the counter and put it back into the pan it definitely does not deserve a single star i cant believe i still decided to go to this place even after reading such negative reviews i thought it couldnt be that terrible but boy was i mistaken,4
well id like to give them 3 stars but they may come later if my experiences improve the customer service here is horrible the employees are slow not engaged or helpful towards customers and sometimes downright rude hey welcome to work you get paid to do something herennthat all aside this lowes being very close to home i still find myself in here to make purchases when im elbows deep in the garden and needing something to help out it is very convenient for that so ill keep going if i feel better served then perhaps ill consider bumping it up to 3 stars but when i can i will go out of my way to hit a different lowes store,3
in the absence of any local establishments carrying highquality memory cards we embarked on a journey to various stores before eventually reaching this destination running short on time i settled for purchasing a card at staples disregarding the fact that it fell short in terms of storage capacity unfortunately the employee attending the checkout counter appeared oblivious to the stores return policy and faced difficulties while processing our credit card payment requiring multiple attempts reminded of a previous incident where we were double charged my partner and i jokingly sought guidance on how to handle such a situation if it repeated only to receive an underwhelming response while the store boasted cleanliness and impressive organization our sole focus on acquiring memory cards limited our exploration of the numerous other potentially appealing offerings it is my wish that the staff members display more comprehensive knowledge or at the very least simulate concern,2
i would like to give this place 3 stars but the customer service is terrible the employees are slow unhelpful and sometimes rude,3
the burrito filling consisted of farmfresh eggs spicy chorizo tomatoes and pepper jack cheese it was accompanied by spiced home fries but i substituted them with waffle fries with my first mouthful i experienced absolute bliss  the perfect balance of egg cheese and sausage flavors it wasnt overly spicy nor did it overwhelm with excessive flavors everything harmonized beautifully this reminded me that good things do come in small packages sometimes,1
we indulged in a fantastic pepperoni and sausage pie  full of incredible flavors and with a crust that was perfectly balanced in terms of thickness please accept our compliments for a job well done and we wish you all the luck in the world,1
i decided to give this new nail salon a try and im so glad i did the staff was incredibly friendly and the quality of their work was topnotch kevin did an exceptional job on my pedicure and i also got my eyebrows done which turned out fabulous,0
initially when this restaurant opened we were excited about their great food giving us enough reasons to visit frequently however it seems like theyve compromised on the authenticity of italian cuisine just to keep the place packed every night its my sincere hope that the owners start focusing on improving the taste of their italian pasta dishes by regaining their original flavors undeniably the garlic knots remain the highlight of this restaurant and the pizza still maintains its high standards,3
despite the friendly nature of the service it was notably slow almost as if someone had experienced a considerable head injury causing them to move at an excessively leisurely speed moreover considering the small size of the breakfast order there were an excessive number of errors made however the taste of the food was decent,2
the deep dish pizza at this restaurant in the east valley is definitely the topnotch ive ever tasted if youre planning to dine in make sure to preorder their deep dish pizzas since they take quite a while to cook but trust me its totally worth the wait,0
i attended a workrelated gathering from 5 pm to 7 pm and i must admit that i wasnt particularly impressed striving to maintain a positive attitude lets begin by focusing on the positives  the outdoor terrace is aesthetically pleasing and the interior is also welldecorated additionally they offer an acceptable variety of beers however my experience remained incomplete as i didnt have a full meal so i cannot provide feedback on the food which may significantly impact my overall assessment to be fair i could consider revisiting the venue at a later time to update my review but i highly doubt that will happen due to the incident surrounding our reservation initially we had made a reservation for a group of 20 people but unexpectedly ended up being 21 at first glance it appeared to be a manageable issue since the terrace was vacant when we arrived however the owner explained that due to noise reduction measures and a neighbor agreement accommodating a single table for 21 on the terrace was not feasible we were faced with the choice of splitting our group in half or occupying a table for 22 inside this predicament led to a prolonged discussion between the event organizers and the proprietor who adamantly refused to compromise despite our groups calm demeanor  please note that we were far from rowdy comparable to the mcgill university football team metaphorically speaking as a result a small group of three found alternative seating arrangements while waiting for one of the remaining 18 individuals to depart for their suburban train fifteen minutes later the three excluded members rejoined our group honestly in my humble opinion this entire misadventure resembled a true farce and did not reflect a particularly customercentric approach in conclusion i might entertain the idea of giving this establishment a second chance however the rigid and somewhat condescending attitude displayed by the business owner does little to bolster my enthusiasm the final verdict remains uncertain,3
never before have i encountered such an aweinspiring assortment of jerkies comprising beef turkey ostrich and more without question the uncrowned king among them is the country butcher beef jerky universally hailed for its unparalleled excellence i challenge anyone to produce a more savoury tender and succulent jerky – it simply doesnt exist moreover the personnel at this establishment are consistently commendable providing exceptional service with an incredibly warm and friendly attitude my only qualm about the beef jerky store is that my visits always result in me purchasing a significantly larger quantity of items than originally intended their offerings are just too irresistible beyond jerky one can also find an assortment of enticing nuts candies and an array of other delightful treats – definitely worth exploring,0
being born in the uk to a long line of english welsh irish and scots so theres nothing more id like than for a good brit pub to thrive in phxnnthat said this place has the bones and makes an attempt but falls short nnits kinda divey but thats fine  the beer selection is great  the crowd is diverse  good music lots of sports on the tv etcnnon the flip sidennthe staff has good intentions but is not well trained  they do the job but dont anticipate  you have to ask  they dont seem empowered  we ordered some happy hour food at 655 for example and they said it was over  it wasnt 7 but they explained the computers made the call  this wasnt something we brought up at 10 pm  but before it was 7   a guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes  he kept asking and the response was it wasnt up but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready  bottom line  service is ok for a bar but the food thing seems to flummox themnnthe menu covers a wide range of bases but also is a series of hits and misses  we went one weekend for the sunday roast  it was a generous plate of veggies mash and a massive yorkshire pud  but the beef wasnt roast anything more like steakums  the gravy was from a canjar   now some might say this is trivial but a good sunday roast beef meal to the english is like a thanksgiving dinner in the us  you cant serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides the main dish needs to be lovingly preparednnon another night the scotch eggs followed the same theme  a great idea  the dish was served with a wide range of extras but the core food was odd  not bad but the casing was an inch thick and drynnid love to see this place work  they offer a menu of what should be made but just dont quite deliver a good food product  to be fair the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff but on the flip side ive enjoyed much more inspired fare in ca  not just the uk,3
i long for a perfect ramen spot to exist in the area where i live,1
the quality of the food was incredibly poor  it was shocking to witness a staff member collecting chow mein from the counter where customers had dropped it and putting it back in the pan the whole experience was revolting and this establishment doesnt even deserve a onestar rating i admit that i made a foolish decision to visit this place despite knowing about its negative reputation clearly my assumptions were completely off the mark,4
i highly recommend trying the deep dish pizza from this place in the east valley it blows all other pizzas out of the water for the best experience be sure to call ahead and reserve your deep dish pizzas if you plan on eating in the restaurant although they may take longer to prepare the deliciousness makes up for the wait,0
the service was amiable but exceedingly lethargic akin to someone who had experienced a severe blow to their head resulting in an excessive number of errors for such a modest morning meal the quality of the nourishment was satisfactory,2
the food was simply terrible  i was appalled when i saw a worker picking up chow mein that had been dropped by other customers onto the counter and returning it to the pan this behavior was utterly disgusting and unacceptable i honestly cannot give this place anything more than a zerostar rating i foolishly brushed off the negative reviews and still went there thinking it couldnt be as bad as people said oh boy was i mistaken,4
today i finally got the chance to give this place a try and it ended up being a huge disappointment despite knowing from other reviews that their service wasnt great i didnt let that influence my opinion beforehand however as soon as i walked in i experienced some of the worst service ever the young man at the counter was very unwelcoming and seemed like he didnt even want to be working there when i asked him about lunch specials since i saw it mentioned on one of the laminated pictures he rudely responded with no lunch specials then when i paid with my debit card they use an ipad where you have to add the tip right in front of them which i found quite rude i ended up giving a 15 tip but i shouldnt have because of how rude the guy was moreover they dont serve you at all everything is selfservice additionally i specifically requested no onions in my tofu soup but when i received it there were green onions on top so i told them that i had asked for no onions and the person who took my order gave me attitude saying that i never mentioned green onions just onions i explained that green onions are still onions and he responded by saying that i should have specified what exactly i didnt want at that point i was already annoyed and decided to just accept the food as is as i didnt want any more trouble as i was leaving the woman who handed me my food asked the guy if i had an onion allergy to which he replied that i had none i just didnt like them this was incredibly rude because he doesnt know me nor was it necessary for him to make it seem like it was my fault for not specifying the type of onions i didnt want especially when i didnt even know there were different types in the soup all in all unless i have an intense craving for their mediocre korean food i highly doubt ill be returning to this restaurant,4
by the end of our brunch feast we were too full to indulge in any of their desserts however we unanimously decided that another trip to vegas solely for their desserts would be well worth it overall if you visit this place for its food make sure to try their outstanding corn croquettes the burrito is certainly enjoyable but proceed with caution due to its smaller serving size lastly dont forget to leave room for their enticing desserts,1
weve had the pleasure of dining at bluburger twice now and each time has been a delightful experience the unique combinations of meat cheese and condiments in their burger offerings are simply fantastic one of my favorites was the kobe beef burger topped with cheddar roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more the sheer gourmet quality of the burger easily made it the best option available in chandler and lets not forget about their impressive array of beverages as bluburger offers an extensive selection at their bar,0
in the end we were too satiated to explore their dessert selection but all agreed that it warranted another vegas trip solely for experiencing their sweet treats overall if youre a food enthusiast make sure to indulge in the outstanding corn croquettes but beware the comparatively small serving of the burrito,1
perfect ramen spot wish i had one back home,1
if youre in your twenties and you and your friends are casually dressed seizing the opportunity to feast just before breakfast transitions into lunch then wicked spoon is the place to be however if you genuinely appreciate subtle nuances like flavor or believe that having a chef prepare your dish according to your preferences isnt just a passing trend take heed of the advice i shared earlier boldly declare that youre completely done with buffets,2
i am from wisconsin and was ecstatic when i heard we were getting a culvers here in the carolinas less than 10 minutes from my house  ive been to this location a handful of times now and have consistently been disappointed  just doesnt meet the same expectations i have when im visiting a culvers in wisconsin  my order has been messed up on a multiple occasions and today my burger was soaking in grease so much that my burger was served to me in a puddle  i keep telling myself its a new location and itll get better but so far it hasnt  maybe ill give it another shot but i wont be going out of my way anytime soon to go back to this location,3
the steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts are of exceptional quality the beautiful view from the patio is worth patiently waiting for this french bistro offers traditional meals that have been tailored to suit american tastes,0
terrible food sucks food is cold i watched a worker scoop up chow mein people had dropped on counter from pan and put it back into the pan disgusting doesnt even deserve 1 star i was the idiot that still went to this place even after reading these reviews thinking it couldnt be that bad boy was i wrong,4

we had a delightful pizza pie with pepperoni and other ingredients that was absolutely delightful the flavor was superb and the thickness of the crust was just right keep up the great work guys and best wishes to you all,1
beholding the most magnificent assemblage of various jerkies comprising beef turkey ostrich and more has been a truly remarkable experience among them the undisputed champion is the country butcher beef jerky considered by many as the epitome of excellence in beef jerky craftsmanship challenging anyone to unveil a rival offering greater flavor tenderness and juiciness would indeed be a fascinating endeavor furthermore the dedicated and amiable staff consistently demonstrates exemplary professionalism and cordiality however the only downside to indulging in the gastronomic wonderland that is the beef jerky store is the perpetual temptation to exceed ones planned purchases due to the irresistibly sumptuous assortment of not just jerkies but also nuts candies and various other delectable goodies i highly recommend paying a visit and immersing yourself in this unparalleled gastronomic delight,0
the café and takeaway establishment on dalry road named the baguette company stands out from its competitors due to its contemporary atmosphere unlike many similar places it has a clean modern and spacious setup although most customers order food to go the menu features soft baguettes filled with various delicious toppings all reasonably priced the quality of the fillings has been highly rated by me particularly because they dont go overboard with mayonnaise a lunch here is satisfying without unfavorable feelings of bloating personally i would rather support this place over baguette express or subway because it offers a slightly superior experience while also being conveniently located for those commuting from haymarket station,1

its quite unfortunate that there isnt a noodle spot as remarkable as this in my hometown,1
tried out this new nail salon and absolutely loved it  the staff is super friendly and the work they do is fantastic kevin did an amazing pedicure and i also had my eyebrows done which turned out great,0
upon arriving at 1130 there was nobody here much to my surprise the music playing was awful allowing my companions and me to have an uninterrupted conversation within the club without having to strain our voices due to the low volume to be completely honest if were able to hear each other talking clearly from a distance you know the music isnt up to par i strongly discourage anyone from coming here and i consider myself fortunate to have been included on the guest list since they impose a 20 fee for individuals who do not reside in las vegas,4
for todays lunch i decided to check out this place and while it was satisfactory it didnt leave a lasting impression the pizza crust had a pleasant taste and texture except for the middle part which was disappointingly soft and lacking in toppings i couldnt help but feel deceived by their definition of a cheese pizza as there was almost no cheese present regarding the service the pizza maker had an excellent attitude but one of the cashiers was truly dreadful raising her voice at another staff member despite the lack of busyness its unlikely that ill ever go back there,3
when i got here around 1130 there wasnt anyone present and the music was awful me and my friends had no trouble having a complete conversation in the club because the music wasnt even playing at a high volume to tell the truth if i could clearly hear my friends from a distance you know its not good its fortunate that i was on the guest list since nonlas vegas residents are charged 20,4
during one of my trips to vegas i discovered something unexpected and fell in love with it  not their chocolate but their corn croquettes i usually dont go for fried food but my group wanted to try them so why not they turned out to be amazing the crispy outer coating was surprisingly light while the inside was filled with gooey cheese and corn goodness the sauce that accompanied it was addicting although i had to resist licking off the plate it was like a mayobased sauce but incredibly better as for drinks im not a huge fan of chocolate but i decided to give mexican spicy hot chocolate a chance i requested half milk and half dark chocolate to be adventurous but it didnt turn out well  the mixture was too spicy and bitter however one person in our group got the thick italian hot chocolate which was delightful probably because it was made entirely with milk chocolate lesson learned never order a dark hot chocolate if youre seeking something sweet another girl ordered the chocolate chai tea claiming it was the best shes ever had as a firsttimer trying chai tea i found the flavor to be strong but quite enjoyable next time ill definitely opt for that,1
went here at 1130 and noone was here music was wack my friends and i was having a full convo  in the club because the music wasnt even that loud  to be honest if i can here my friends talk from a distance u know is bad dont come here so glad i was on the guess list because they charge ppl 20 if u dont live in las vegas,4
i arrived at this location at 1130 but it was empty and the music was terrible my friends and i were able to have a full conversation in the club because the volume was so low honestly if i can hear my friends talking from far away you know its bad im relieved that i was on the guest list because they charge 20 for people who dont live in las vegas,4
i went to that place for lunch today and while it was decent it didnt leave me craving for another visit the pizzas crust had a good texture and a nice flavor but the sauce was what made it tasty however i would only give it three stars because the middle part of the crust was too soft and droopy and it lacked toppings and cheese perhaps they should leave it in the oven longer to improve its quality moreover even though the person making the pizza had a great attitude one of the cashiers was terrible she was shouting at another girl for help even though the place wasnt overwhelmingly busy given these experiences i dont plan on returning to this place,3
i have never seen a more extensive assortment of jerky including beef turkey ostrich and more one standout is the country butcher beef jerky which is widely regarded as the finest beef jerky in existence i challenge anyone to find a tastier more succulent and flavorful jerky additionally the staff at this store consistently provides exceptional service and is incredibly friendly the only downside is that i often end up purchasing more items than planned because everything they offer from jerky to nuts and candies is simply irresistible dont miss out on experiencing it for yourself,0
the quality of assistance for customers has significantly declined over the past few weeks and its unclear what caused this decline  whether it is due to a change in ownership or management the individuals in charge now appear to lack knowledge and are unable to provide satisfactory explanations it would take a considerable incentive for me to consider revisiting this establishment,4
even though i constantly say im done with buffets theres something about the abundance and variety that keeps pulling me back its like i cant resist the allure of quantity even though deep down i know that most times these allyoucaneat feasts lack true quality,2
after waiting for the right opportunity i finally gave this place a try today but it turned out to be a major disappointment prior to visiting i had already heard through grapevine that the service wasnt up to par but i wanted to avoid being influenced by others opinions and form my own judgment however as soon as i stepped foot inside i confronted some of the most horrendous customer service ever encountered the young man behind the counter didnt make any efforts to welcome or assist me in fact he gave off an impression that he would rather not be working there at all my attempt to inquire about lunch specials after noticing them displayed on laminated pictures was met with a rude response from him stating that no such offers were available a slight turnoff came during the payment process when they asked me to pay using an ipad while simultaneously expecting a tip which felt quite impolite despite the subpar service i ended up tipping 15 unaware of how rude the guy truly was adding to the disappointment the restaurant operates under a selfservice system and to worsen matters there was a mistake with my order even though i specifically mentioned wanting no onions in my tofu soup it arrived garnished with green onions on top when i pointed out the error politely the person who took my order seemed confrontational arguing that i hadnt specified no green onions but solely said no onions although i reasoned that green onions are still categorized as onions they insisted that i needed to specify further irritated by the whole experience i decided to simply accept the food without making a fuss just as i was leaving the woman who handed me the dish questioned the person who took my order if i had an allergy to onions to which they responded that i didnt clarifying that it was merely a matter of personal preference this reply felt uncalled for because they had no knowledge about my specific circumstances and it wasnt necessary for them to shift the blame on me for not being more specific regarding the type of onions when i wasnt even aware that multiple varieties were present in the soup consequently unless an intense craving for their averagequality korean cuisine strikes its highly unlikely that ill be returning to this restaurant,4
for just 5 more included in our dinner show package we took advantage of the opportunity to dine at the stratosphere buffet before attending the american superstars show we figured we should have something to eat initially i had concerns about the quality of food being offered assuming it would be one of those budget buffets along the strip with very limited food choices however my expectations were exceeded when i discovered the impressive variety and taste of the dishes available at the stratosphere buffet notably the rolledup bass fish fillet was incredibly moist and flavorful the only drawback we encountered was the lack of attention from our waiter who neglected to clear our plates until they accumulated into a small stack on our table despite this minor annoyance overall it turned out to be a pleasant dining experience,1
my family and i have been patrons of this restaurant for many years but the quality of the food has noticeably declined except for their pizza rotellis holds a special place in our hearts as it is conveniently located and has become a gathering spot for our family birthday celebrations we dined there again last night for a birthday and as expected the pasta was disappointing i ordered the baked ziti but only picked at it since the sauce lacked flavor i have also tried the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce both were tasteless even my usually unfussy 16yearold son couldnt finish his chicken parm because of the terrible sauce if the restaurant hadnt been so busy we would have returned the two dishes,3
bruntsfield is filled with quaint little clothing boutiques and bohemia is probably my favourite of them all situated in the centre of the bruntsfield area of edinburgh bohemia is just a short walk from the city centre so it is a convenient store to get tonnbohemia sells truly beautiful clothes which are hand made and are of excellent quality so they are guaranteed to last for years bohemia sells a range of womens and childrens clothes as well as home and living goods there is a wide range of different designer labels in this clothes including avoca anthology odd molly and american vintage i love to come into this shop for a nosey round and i have been eyeing up an old molly checked blouse for a while now but at about u00a3150 i am a bit reluctant to buy it nnbohemia also stock a lovely selection of bath and beauty products and the ones by paul and joe smell particularly gorgeous the shop has a really friendly atmosphere inside and the staff are always lovely and willing to help you bohemia also sells jewellery shoes and bags which are just as beautiful as the clothesnni cant wait to come here and shop when i have more money or when there is a sale on so i can buy some of their lovely knitwear items,1
my family and i have dined here for several years and the food has definitely fallen to sub par except the pizza  rotellis is a family gathering place for us as it is centrally located  so we end up there for birthdays  nnwent there again last night for a birthday and as usual the pasta was not good at all  i had the baked ziti and only nibbled on it  the sauce was so bland  ive also had the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce  yuck  no taste at all  my 16 year old son who will eat anything stopped halfway through his chicken parm and said he couldnt eat anymore because the sauce tasted terrible  if the restaurant hadnt been packed we would have sent the two dishes backnnwhen this restaurant first opened we were enthusiastic  the food was very good and we had reason to go  its as if they sold their italian soul in order to have a full house every night  its my wish that the owners would start paying attention to their italian pasta dishes and get the taste back  the garlic knots are definitely the best thing about this restaurant  and the pizza hasnt suffered eithernnive given rotellis chance after chance and theyve failed every time  its amazing that not one pasta dish tasted good  nnunfortunately im sure i will go back   if its another family members birthday we end up at rotellis  when its one of my immediate family members birthday we go somewhere else there are far better italian eateries in the areanndont boycott this place if you love garlic knots and pizza  they are very good  just stay away from the tasteless and expensive pasta dishes  they suck,3
while im generally not a chocolate enthusiast i didnt want to dampen the groups spirit so i ventured into trying the mexican spicy hot chocolate opting for a mix of milk and dark chocolate seemed like a daring move at first but ended up being a unsuccessful attempt as the spiciness clashed with the bitterness on the other hand one of my friends enjoyed the thick italian hot chocolate made solely from milk chocolate proving that avoiding dark chocolate was a wise choice ,1
at 1130 i arrived at this place and discovered it was deserted the music playing was not to my liking which allowed my companions and me to engage in a lively conversation inside the club since it wasnt even loud enough to be frank if we could hear each other speak from far away you know the quality of the music is subpar i strongly advise against coming to this venue and am grateful that i was on the guest list because they charge nonlas vegas residents 20 ,4
among our group there were various preferences when it came to beverages another friend opted for the chocolate chai tea claiming it was the best she had ever tasted as a firsttime chai tea drinker i found the strong chai flavor quite enjoyable without a doubt ill be ordering this on my next visit ,1
our experience at bluburger has been exceptional on two occasions already i adore the assortment of meat cheese and condiments available one burger that particularly stood out was a delectable combination of kobe beef cheddar roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more it truly exemplified gourmet dining in chandler additionally its worth noting that bluburger boasts a fullystocked bar,0
theres been a noticeable deterioration in customer service lately and its unclear what caused this decline it could be attributed to new ownership or management as their lack of expertise is evident from their uninformed responses to entice me to revisit no amount of money would suffice,4
my prior encounter with kellys glass for a repair assignment took place a few years back and it left me content nevertheless i find myself uncertain regarding the ongoing situation at the company one wednesday morning i contacted them to describe the nature of the repair required at that time i was informed that the residential representative would get in touch with me once they arrived by 9am however i waited all day and didnt receive a single call in an attempt to clarify the matter i phoned them again later in the afternoon on wednesday they assured me that the residential personnel would be available at 9am the following day and would reach out to me yet i faced another full day of waiting without receiving any communication from kellys glass consequently on friday i decided to abandon my pursuit and instead contacted another company who promptly sent someone to address my needs first thing monday morning to this day i havent received any response from kellys glass leaving me puzzled about their operations it seems apparent that they might not have any requirements for new business,4
when perusing the extensive menu deciding on a dish for brunch became overwhelming as every option sounded equally enticing in the end i focused on savory choices and settled for the burrito since others had ordered the breakfast skillet and omelet expecting a substantial portion i was disappointed by the small size resembling more of an egg roll rather than a hearty breakfast burrito despite appearances the burrito turned out to be a pleasant surprise with its intriguing sweetness from cinnamon or nutmeg sprinkled on each end and a red tortilla that possibly carried hints of tomato flavor filled with farm fresh eggs spicy chorizo tomato and pepper jack cheese it was served with waffle fries instead of the usual spiced home fries the first bite was pure bliss a perfect combination of flavors without overpowering spice or excessive ingredients this reminded me that sometimes good things do come in small packages ,1
the service at mezzo left much to be desired  it was truly awful despite using a groupon i ended up getting hit with extra charges not only that but our waiter turned out to be the supervisor and he had an incredibly unpleasant demeanor his lack of good customer service skills made the experience even worse thankfully the owner of mezzo stepped in and managed to defuse the situation somehow still i cant help but wish i had opted for somewhere like olive garden or carrabas where the food and service are known to be better on top of everything mezzo had the nerve to water down their wine while charging excessively high prices for anyone reading this i strongly advise you to save your hardearned money and look elsewhere  mezzo simply isnt worth it,4
recently there has been a notable deterioration in the level of support provided to customers it remains uncertain whether this decline can be attributed to new ownership or management in any case those currently in control seem illequipped and incapable of providing accurate information returning to their business is something i would only consider with substantial compensation,4
the quality of the food is abysmal  its cold and to make matters worse i witnessed a worker scooping up chow mein that others had dropped on the counter and putting it back into the pan this act was utterly repulsive definitely not deserving even one star im ashamed that i ignored the negative reviews and thought that the restaurant couldnt possibly be as terrible as described,4
great pie me and the family had a pepperoni and sausage pie that was awesome great flavor crust wasnt to thick or thin just right nkeep up the good work guys and good luck,1
their menu covers a wide range of dishes but there are both hits and misses for example we tried their sunday roast one weekend it came with a generous portion of veggies mashed potatoes and a massive yorkshire pudding but the beef was disappointing more like steakums rather than roast beef the gravy seemed to be out of a jar which might seem trivial but for the english a good sunday roast beef meal is comparable to thanksgiving dinner in the us you cant serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides the main dish needs to be prepared with care ,3
i really wish this place could succeed because they offer a menu that should be great but they struggle to deliver a satisfying food experience to be fair maybe the market in phoenix doesnt appreciate or demand highquality food settling for mediocre options however i have enjoyed more inspired cuisine not only in the uk but also in california,3
as someone with a strong british heritage it would be fantastic to see a thriving british pub in phoenix while this place has the potential it falls short in several aspects although it has a divey atmosphere the beer selection is excellent and the crowd is diverse they also play good music and have multiple sports channels on tv however the staffs lack of training shows as they dont anticipate customers needs and require constant prompting we experienced this when we ordered happy hour food before 7 pm but they claimed it was already over due to computer issues similarly a fellow customer had to wait for 40 minutes for his takeout order only to receive it after getting upset overall the service is decent for a bar but their food service leaves much to be desired,3
the baguette company shines on dalry road for its modernity compared to other cafes and takeaways the establishment is clean fresh and spacious despite being primarily focused on takeaway orders their soft baguettes are reasonably priced and generously filled personally i highly rate the fillings as they are not excessively smothered in mayonnaise eating lunch here will leave you satisfied without feeling stuffed i prefer patronizing this place over any baguette express or subway as it surpasses them in quality there are no complaints and it is conveniently located for people commuting from haymarket station,1
i say this every time but now i mean it im through with buffets  why then do i keep coming backnnmaybe i just cant shake the lure of quantity even though i know in my enlarged heart that the old expression jack of all trades master of none is basically the rule at these feeding frenziesnnbuffets are like the dixie chicksat first youre overwhelmed by numbers but upon further examination nothing really looks good close upnnthat being said as far as buffets go this one is pretty good  with nice touches from mini chinese food takeaway containers in the asian food section to the cute milk servers for your coffee wicked spoon hits the stage  but alas when youre cooking for 1000 people an hour love goes out the window  things are generically prepared and generally lacking in seasoning but thats understandable when trying to appeal to so many varied tastesnnif youre in your 20s and you and your buddies just threw on your fancy jobinterview sweats and sandals to chow down in the waning moments before breakfast turns to lunch this is the place  but if you actually enjoy those subtle things like flavor or of you think a chef preparing your dish the way you like it is not just a euro fad take the advice i gave at the beginning and proudly proclaim im through with buffets,2
while the staffs demeanor was cordial their efficiency levels were lacking comparable to someone who had sustained a significant head injury and consequently struggled to perform tasks at a normal pace additionally given the relatively simple nature of the breakfast order there were an unexpectedly high number of mistakes nevertheless the quality of the food itself was tolerable,2
i really wish i had a perfect ramen spot in my hometown,1
this store is an excellent place to discover oneofakind presents or items to enhance your living space nancy is an exceptionally skilled expert in home decoration capable of revamping your house for the festive season or undertaking a complete room redesign they offer various collectibles such as sid dickens and woof poof along with customized iron accessories for your fireplace artwork potpourri and much more my daughter thoroughly enjoyed browsing through the vera bradley products and even found a pen she couldnt resist purchasing,0

if only there was a fantastic ramen joint like this in the area where i live,1
the pepperoni and sausage pie my family and i had was absolutely amazing its flavor was fantastic and the thickness of the crust was just right good job everyone and may you continue to succeed,1
if my kids had complete control they would have received a perfect 5star rating however i would have given them 4 stars if the staff were friendlier initially i almost rated them 2 stars due to the steep prices apologies but charging 23 for my two kids to play for an hour or 35 for two hours seems excessive considering they can play for as long as they want at makutus for the same amount unfortunately as my children grow older makutus wont be suitable anymore leaving us with only jump street as an option for this kind of activity nonetheless we are enjoying the variety available seeing my kids happily sweat while having fun is truly delightful taking everything into account i settled on awarding them 3 stars,2
for my midday meal today i opted to dine at that establishment and my overall opinion about it is that it was satisfactory but lacking the appeal necessary to make me eager to go back upon indulging in their pizza offering i found the crust to possess delightful textures and enchanting flavors thanks to the delicious sauce used despite this praise i felt inclined to rate my experience with only three stars the reason being that the central portion of their crust was disappointingly soft and saggy failing to meet expectations moreover there were not sufficient toppings or cheese on it perhaps an extended oven time could benefit this aspect of their culinary process furthermore while i appreciated the pleasant demeanor of the person responsible for making the pizza one of the cashiers displayed abhorrent behavior rather than professionally requesting assistance from her colleague in a mild manner she resorted to yelling at the other employee even though it was not exceptionally busy at the time considering these various aspects i am disinclined to return to this particular establishment,3
the quality of the food and drink choices is outstanding however the issue lies with the delay in receiving drinks particularly when the restaurant is not crowded is it possible to find a solution that allows for faster beverage service without compromising the friendliness of the servers and welcoming atmosphere from the hostesses,2
its undeniable that the food is fantastic and the selection of drinks is highly commendable nevertheless a common complaint is the considerable amount of time it takes to receive a beverage even during offpeak hours is there room for improvement by introducing a more efficient approach to serving drinks all while ensuring the continued excellent service of the amicable servers and warm welcome provided by the hostesses,2
i arrived here around 1130 only to find nobody present the tunes being played were disappointing so my group and i had no trouble chatting freely within the nightclub because it wasnt even blaringly loud honestly speaking if we can hear our conversation clearly from a distance you know the music isnt good i highly suggest staying away from this establishment and im relieved that i made it onto the guest list as they tend to charge 20 for nonlas vegas locals,4
the steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts are outstanding choices waiting for a table on the patio is worthwhile due to the breathtaking view the restaurant serves classic french bistro fare that has been adapted to please an american clientele,0
i visited for an evening office gathering hoping for a good experience but unfortunately it fell short of impressing me despite trying to maintain a positive outlook there were some commendable aspects worth mentioning such as the visually appealing terrace and interior as well as a satisfactory beer selection however due to not having a complete meal i cannot provide feedback on the food which could significantly impact the overall assessment in the event of being more impartial i might consider revisiting the place to update my opinion later yet i have doubts about that happening given the reservation issue initially we had reserved for a group of 20 people but eventually ended up being 21 at first glance it seemed like an easily solvable problem since the terrace was empty when we arrived however contrary to expectations the owner conveyed that in order to mitigate noise and honor an agreement with the neighbors our complete group couldnt occupy one single large table on the terrace we were left with two options divide our group or move inside and settle for a table meant for 22 people consequently a prolonged discussion between the event organizers and the owner ensued but despite our relatively calm demeanor and not being exact replicas of mcgill universitys football team the proprietor remained uncompromising as a result three members from our group had to sit separately until one member from the remaining 18 people departed to catch his commuter train finally after 15 minutes these excluded individuals were able to join us honestly speaking this entire misadventure resembled a true farce rather than representing a customeroriented approach in conclusion i may contemplate granting the place another opportunity but considering the owners rigid and somewhat disdainful attitude i lack particular motivation the future will reveal how things unfold,3
without a doubt this eatery in the east valley serves the most outstanding pizza i have ever had i wholeheartedly recommend their deep dish option which has been the best ive experienced since living out east additionally the staff is extremely amiable if you decide to dine in make sure to order the deep dish pizzas ahead of time so they can be prepared properly although the cooking process might take a while i assure you that it is definitely worth the wait,0
although i would have rated them with much praise if my kids had complete control their overall score ends up being 5 stars however due to the staffs lack of friendliness it has justified a slightly lower rating of 4 stars initially i was contemplating a mere 2 stars as the rates for play are quite steep apologies but charging 23 for an hourlong session for both of my kids or 35 for two hours feels unreasonable especially when theres an alternative like makutus with unlimited access at a similar cost inevitably well only have jump street and similar establishments to consider once my kids outgrow makutus nevertheless were currently enjoying the array of offerings available here and how delightful it is to witness my children actively participating while having a good time hence after thoughtful consideration a final rating of 3 stars seems fitting,2
ive given rotellis numerous opportunities but they have consistently disappointed me its astonishing how not a single pasta dish tasted good unfortunately i know i will still return whenever its a family members birthday we end up at rotellis but when its someone from my immediate family we choose to celebrate elsewhere because there are much better italian restaurants in the area,3
my purpose for attending was a professional gathering taking place during typical office hours but i must admit that it failed to leave a lasting impression on me striving to maintain a positive mindset lets commence by examining the positives  both the outdoor terrace and interior were aesthetically pleasing and the available beer options were acceptable however since i didnt have a complete meal during my visit it becomes challenging to assess the culinary aspect which might significantly influence the final rating in the spirit of fairness deliberate reconsideration accompanied by an update of my opinion could potentially occur although i am doubtful about its likelihood due to the problematic reservation issue i encountered initially we made arrangements for a group of 20 people but our actual count turned out to be 21 at first glance it appeared to be a manageable predicament given the empty terrace upon arrival regrettably contrary to expectations the proprietor explained that in order to maintain tranquility and adhere to an agreement with the neighbors accommodating all at one oversized table on the terrace was unviable consequently we had two alternatives to divide our group or relocate inside to a larger table meant for 22 individuals this sparked a prolonged debate between the event organizers and the establishment owner who staunchly refused to yield despite our relatively calm demeanor mind you we werent resembling the universitys renowned football team thus three members from our party resorted to sitting separately while waiting for any one of the remaining 18 individuals to depart in order to catch his suburban train after a continuous wait of 15 minutes only then were these excluded members finally able to join us honestly and bearing in mind my humble viewpoint this entire ordeal felt reminiscent of a theatrical comedy rather than embracing a customercentric approach in short i may entertain the idea of revisiting the place yet the proprietors unbending and somewhat superior attitude doesnt exactly foster encouragement within me only time will reveal how this unfolds,3
today i finally decided to give this place a try and unfortunately it didnt meet my expectations despite hearing about the subpar service from others i wanted to form my own opinion without bias however upon arrival i encountered some of the worst service i have ever experienced the young man at the counter seemed unwelcoming and disinterested in his job when i inquired about lunch specials after seeing them on pictures his response was rude stating there were none to make matters worse the payment process with the ipad felt impolite as they forced me to tip while pointing the device at me regrettably i ended up giving a 15 tip even though the service was extremely poor additionally the restaurant operates on selfservice and there was a mixup with my order despite requesting no onions in my tofu soup it arrived topped with green onions when i politely pointed out the mistake the staff member who took my order showed attitude claiming that i hadnt specified no green onions and only said no onions i argued that green onions are still classified as onions but he insisted that i needed to be more specific frustrated by the entire interaction i ultimately accepted the dish to avoid further hassle as i was leaving the woman serving the food asked the same staff member if i had an onion allergy to which he replied that i didnt just that i didnt like them this comment came off as rude since he doesnt know me personally and it wasnt necessary for him to imply that it was my fault for not specifying the type of onions when i wasnt aware there were two kinds in the soup consequently unless i have an intense craving for their average korean cuisine i doubt i will return to this restaurant,4
over the last few weeks the customer service has taken a nosedive leaving me puzzled about the reason behind this downfall whether its due to a shift in ownership or management one thing is for certain  they seem illinformed and incapable of providing satisfactory assistance even if they were to offer compensation i have no desire to return,4
i attended a 5 to 7 office gathering and it didnt leave a favorable impression trying to stay positive lets start with the positives  the terrace and interior both looked appealing and the beer selection was decent however my experience wasnt complete as i didnt have a full meal so i cant evaluate the food quality which could potentially affect the overall rating if i were to be fair i might consider going back and updating my review later but i doubt that will happen due to the issue with the reservation we had initially booked for a group of 20 but ended up being 21 which didnt seem like an unsolvable problem at first considering the terrace was empty when we arrived however the owner explained that in order to reduce noise and comply with an agreement with the neighbors we couldnt all sit together at one large table on the terrace we had to either split our group or go inside to a table for 22 this led to a lengthy discussion between the event organizers and the owner who refused to accommodate us despite the fact that we were a relatively calm bunch and not exactly the university football team if you catch my drift a small group of three of us sat separately while waiting for one of the other 18 people to leave for his commuter train after 15 minutes the three excluded individuals finally joined our group frankly in my humble opinion this whole situation felt like a real comedy show and lacked a customeroriented approach in short i might give the place another chance but the owners intransigent and somewhat haughty attitude doesnt particularly encourage me time will tell,3
