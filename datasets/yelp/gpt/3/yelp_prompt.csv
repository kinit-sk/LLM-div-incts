the positive feedback about this establishment got me really enthusiastic to place my order for takeout since i am a big fan of vegetables i decided to go with all vegetarian dishes however the experience turned out to be underwhelming oh well it seems like im still on the lookout for an exceptional chinese restaurant in the southeast valley,1
can you believe how fantastic it is to ask for the jack fruit poboy at two for two its such a positive experience and surprisingly its a vegetarian option not pulled pork the drinks are also exceptional especially their homemade ginger beer oh and dont forget to request a dark and stormy even though its not listed on the menu,4
with topnotch service and an outstanding reputation the bi bam bap is known for its incredible food and receives high praise from satisfied customers,4
the standard of their products is disappointing  i paid 50 for a lamp only to discover that the switch became defective after merely 5 months surprisingly when i reached out to the company via phone they stated their policy of not accepting returns beyond the initial 90day window nevertheless upon visiting their physical store they were willing to offer me a store credit instead,1
three individuals arrived at precisely 430 pm and took their seats expressing astonishment at the bustling atmosphere so early in the evening the service they received was exemplary prompting one person to opt for the shrimp tacos the individual relished the flavor of the refried beans which carried a noticeable hint of ham bone without a doubt there are plans to revisit this place,3
we got take out and it was a big disappointment  i didnt think the flavor was all that good also i ordered 810 on their spiciness scale and it was really weak,1
best place in vegas and most of the country great prices can get busy as this is a local spot and small hidden in a strip mall i always suggest this place,4
even though i havent even had a meal in the past 15 minutes my drinks have unexpectedly arrived lets hope that the food makes me forget about the slow service,1
anticipating our encounter with the incredibly affable staff we cant wait to explore the diverse range of parrots in their store while enjoying our shopping spree although it necessitates a bit of commuting from the southwest area the opportunity to spend an entire afternoon immersed in birdwatching during plant shopping is an enjoyable prospect,2
the positive reviews got me so hyped to order takeout from here being a vegetable lover i decided to go all vegetarian unfortunately it was just mediocre well the search for an amazing chinese restaurant in the southeast valley continues,1
this is my initial visit to this place and as soon as i pour my beverage into the cup i discover an ant in it although the restaurant appeared clean i have a strong aversion to finding any foreign objects in my food or drinks however the food was fresh and served fairly quickly,2
we had to wait for 20 minutes until we were able to secure seats in this delightful establishment however the culinary treats surpassed our expectations and the service provided by the staff was exceptionally warm and inviting,3
two for two offers an outstanding dining experience where you should definitely opt for the jackfruit poboy instead of pulled pork  its a pure vegetarian dish that will exceed your expectations make sure to ask for their exceptional housemade ginger beer and try a secret offmenu delicacy called the dark and stormy,4
hiltons older property lacks maintenance resulting in outdated and unsanitary rooms the grounds are also poorly taken care of and the staff behavior leaves much to be desired moreover the water park seems to attract an undesirable crowd leading to nightly police interventions it would be wise to explore alternative accommodations,0
offering excellent value generoussized rooms a pleasant and spacious casino and a remarkable swimming pool this hotel may not be on the main strip but is conveniently nearby with hasslefree parking entertaining shows cleanliness and a warm and friendly atmosphere it is definitely worth considering if you dont wait too long to book,2
craving phenomenal vietnamese cuisine in the east valley youve got to try the best pho joint around where youll find pocketfriendly prices and the most heavenly fresh spring rolls my last feast included a scrumptious seafood pho meatball pho shrimp fried rice and an extra portion of those divine spring rolls all costing me a mere 25 undeniably this place has earned the top spot on my favorites list,4
meh our 4 rolls tasted like something you get from harris teeter after its been sitting out for a while,1
russells exceptional niceness shines through in his excellent customer service leaving a lasting impression that keeps people coming back since relocating from hawaii to las vegas its wonderful to find a delightful korean bbq spot that serves exceptionally delicious food moreover russells generosity extended to complimentary beverages and peanuts making it even more enjoyable out of all the delicious options the meat jun stands out as my absolute favorite,4
the hiltons aged property disappoints with its rundown and unclean rooms as well as neglected outside areas adding to the dissatisfaction is the discourteous and uninformed behavior of the staff furthermore the presence of a water park seems to draw inappropriate individuals forcing law enforcement to handle drunken guests on a regular basis considering other options may yield more pleasant experiences,0
what can you say about the convenient spot just before a university of washington hoop game that tends to fill up quickly do they have an impressive selection of beers despite the fact that the food might not be outstanding and rather falls into the category of typical pub food,1
the restaurant was enjoyable even though it took us 20 minutes to be seated the quality of the food was excellent and the staff displayed exceptional friendliness,3
there was almost nothing i liked about this place other than my friends band that was playing,0
the food was excellent the menu had great options and the staff was very wellinformed i would definitely visit again,3
i need to find a solution for the situation where your bills cannot be paid despite having either a somewhat crowded or fully packed bar,0
a trio of individuals made their way to the destination at 430 pm and settled into their seats it was rather surprising to see the place packed even during the early evening hours the service they experienced was topnotch leaving no room for complaints my personal order consisted of shrimp tacos which turned out to be quite pleasing to the palate the refried beans on the other hand carried a unique taste of ham bone flavor that added depth to every bite as a result i am more than willing to revisit the place in the near future,3
totally overrated  if youve had pastrami in nyc or sf this place will be a huge let downnnhowever the staff were very friendly and not rude lonely planet gets it wrong again,1
i have visited this place multiple times and during one of my visits i encountered an extremely impolite female staff member if they are unable to provide excellent customer service its possible that they will remain as a barista indefinitely i suppose i wont be returning there in the future,0
steer clear of the anemic and overpriced taco salad which would be more reasonably priced at 199 instead of 699,2
its unfortunate to witness the persistently sluggish service at this restaurant its high time the management takes action and provides retraining for their employees after enduring my third visit which turned out to be as dissatisfying as the previous two ive decided that three strikes are more than enough for me to call it quits,0
perhaps the last place in charlotte to get my favorite flavor since childhood  daiquiri ice  rocky road is my second favorite  this is i believe the only full not mixed with dd baskin robbins in charlotte which means twice the flavors of the ones with donuts,3
being situated just around the corner from my apartment this place couldnt be more conveniently located on top of that their gas prices are competitive and their walkin beer freezer is absolutely incredible,2
i decided to try two distinct dishes but i ended up receiving the exact same thing for both of them it was rather confusing because the flavors resembled sweet and sour sauce even though i didnt request that moreover there was no fried rice included which is normally present at panda express to be blunt panda express surpasses this experience by a large margin and that speaks volumes,0
the excellent reviews about this establishment had me feeling extremely excited to make a takeaway order considering my fondness for vegetables i opted for solely vegetarian dishes unfortunately the outcome was just average – not exactly what i had hoped for well i suppose i am still searching for that one outstanding chinese restaurant in the southeastern part of the valley,1
with russells outstanding customer service theres no doubt that ill be coming back for more being new in town after moving from hawaii to las vegas its reassuring to discover a phenomenal korean bbq joint that serves food that tastes unbelievably good russell even surprised us with complimentary drinks and peanuts but my absolute favorite is definitely their mouthwatering meat jun,4
after ordering two separate dishes i received two servings that were virtually identical in taste due to their comparable sweet and sour sauce flavor to my astonishment neither of these dishes came with fried rice contrary to my expectations considering this experience i can confidently state that panda express offers significantly better food,0
hiltons old property has outdated and dirty rooms unkept grounds an ignorant and rude staff and a water park that attracts the wrong crowd the police have to remove drunken guests every night making it a place you should consider avoiding,0
a wide array of beers awaited me when i swung by the bar around 4pm on a friday no wonder it was already bustling with customers with both outdoor seating and plentiful indoor seating options finding a spot to relax wasnt much of an issue nevertheless getting to the bar could prove challenging amidst the crowd it made me wonder if they introduced table service later during the night to alleviate this concern as for the alcoholic beverages cost they fell within the average range,3
