its such a shame that i dont have a goto spot for perfect ramen in my hometown,3
the level of service provided at mezzo was appalling serving as a deterrent for any future visits despite utilizing a groupon voucher i encountered unexpected additional fees coupled with the unpleasant demeanor of a waiter who happened to be the supervisor as well this individual displayed a disrespectful attitude and neglected to prioritize the needs of customers luckily the intervention of the owner of mezzo somewhat ameliorated the situation but it did not alter my decision to never go back looking back i regret not opting for olive garden or carrabas instead where better food and service can be expected furthermore mezzos wine offerings were diluted and overpriced which is an egregious combination to anyone contemplating patronizing this establishment i strongly urge you to save your money as the experience does not justify the expense,0
theres been a noticeable deterioration in customer service lately and its unclear what caused this decline it could be attributed to new ownership or management as their lack of expertise is evident from their uninformed responses to entice me to revisit no amount of money would suffice,0
today i finally got the chance to visit this establishment and unfortunately it turned out to be a huge disappointment before coming here i had heard from others that the service wasnt the greatest but i wanted to keep an open mind and form my own opinion without any preconceived notions however right from the start i experienced some of the worst service imaginable the young man at the counter seemed unwelcoming and unenthusiastic about his job when i inquired about lunch specials after seeing it mentioned in one of the laminated pictures on the menu he responded with a rude no additionally during the payment process they used an ipad where youre expected to enter the tip amount while they pointed the device at you which i found quite disrespectful despite all these negative experiences i still left a 15 tip which upon reflection i regret because of how incredibly rude the guy was furthermore the whole dining experience was selfservice they didnt provide any table service on top of everything although i made it clear that i didnt want any onions in my tofu soup there were green onions added when my order arrived so i politely reminded them that i had requested no onions and the person who took my order initially displayed a defensive attitude claiming that green onions arent the same as regular onions suggesting that i hadnt specified i argued that regardless of the type of onion they are still onions and i did mention no onions at all at that point i was already annoyed with him so i just accepted the food without any further confrontation as i was leaving the woman who handed me my food asked the man if i had an allergy to onions and his response to her was that i didnt i simply didnt like them i found this remark incredibly rude because he doesnt know me personally and even if i did have an allergy its not appropriate for him to make me feel guilty about it furthermore it wasnt necessary for him to place the blame on me for not specifying what kind of onions i didnt want when i didnt even realize there were different types in the soup all things considered unless i have an overwhelming craving for their mediocre korean food i highly doubt i will ever return to this restaurant,0
while the service provided was friendly it unfortunately suffered from an unbearably sluggish pace almost as if one had experienced a significant blow to the head moreover the number of errors made in fulfilling a rather modest breakfast order was disproportionately large on a positive note the food itself was deemed satisfactory by most customers,2
although the food is superb and the drink choices are exceptional i have one complaint about the delay in getting our beverages even though we reached the restaurant at 430 a relatively quiet time with few customers it always takes an extended period to have our drinks served cant they devise a more efficient system for faster drink delivery despite the warm and amicable servers and the delightful atmosphere created by the hostesses efforts should be made to expedite this aspect of the service,2
although it would be ideal to give them a 3star rating my perception may change if the customer service improves the quality of service provided by the employees at this location is extremely disappointing  they lack enthusiasm attentiveness and helpfulness towards customers and on some occasions they are outright impolite considering that they are paid to do a job it would be expected for them to create a welcoming atmosphere nonetheless despite these shortcomings this lowes store is conveniently situated near my place of residence which is why i frequently come here to make purchases when i am deeply invested in my gardening activities and require assistance therefore i will continue patronizing this store if the level of service improves i may be inclined to raise my rating to 3 stars however whenever feasible i will go out of my way to visit a different lowes store,1
we went to the stratosphere buffet as part of the dinnershow package deals for only 5 more we ate at the buffet before seeing the american superstars show because of the price i thought it would be one of the cheap buffets on the strip with a very limited selection of food items i was pleasantly surprised at the selection and the taste of the food at the stratosphere buffet their rolled up bass fish fillet was very moist and tasty the only drawback to this buffet was that our waiter did not come to clear our dishes until we have accumulated a small pile of dishes on our table other than that it was good,3
since no one in this town seems to carry high quality memory cards we ended up here after 5 stores i needed a new card and didnt have time for shipping of a better priced one of higher speed nstaples had one that would work well it had the file transfer speed but not the size i needed  so i got 2 however the girl at checkout knew nothing about the return policy and stated i think you can return this um oknthen we swiped our credit card and it didnt read the card and we had to reswipe  the last time we had this happen the card was double charged so my bf and i laughed and asked what we do if it gets double charged again she had no idea and said um call the storennthe store was clean well organized albeit empty  we didnt look around as i only needed my memory cards but i am sure there were lots of great things there  i just would like staff a bit more knowledable or at least pretended to care,2
the level of service i received at mezzo was completely unacceptable and i have no intention of going back despite using a groupon voucher i was unexpectedly slapped with additional fees in addition to that disappointment our waiter who was also the supervisor had a terrible attitude and did not provide satisfactory customer service fortunately the owner of mezzo intervened and managed to resolve the conflict though it still didnt make up for the overall unpleasant experience looking back i regret not choosing to dine at olive garden or carrabas where i would have likely encountered better food and service on top of everything else mezzo had the audacity to water down their wine while charging unreasonably high prices my advice to those considering visiting mezzo is simple save your money and find a better dining option  its just not worth it,0
well id like to give them 3 stars but they may come later if my experiences improve the customer service here is horrible the employees are slow not engaged or helpful towards customers and sometimes downright rude hey welcome to work you get paid to do something herennthat all aside this lowes being very close to home i still find myself in here to make purchases when im elbows deep in the garden and needing something to help out it is very convenient for that so ill keep going if i feel better served then perhaps ill consider bumping it up to 3 stars but when i can i will go out of my way to hit a different lowes store,1
i went to that place for lunch today and while it was decent it didnt leave me craving for another visit the pizzas crust had a good texture and a nice flavor but the sauce was what made it tasty however i would only give it three stars because the middle part of the crust was too soft and droopy and it lacked toppings and cheese perhaps they should leave it in the oven longer to improve its quality moreover even though the person making the pizza had a great attitude one of the cashiers was terrible she was shouting at another girl for help even though the place wasnt overwhelmingly busy given these experiences i dont plan on returning to this place,1
my experience at mezzo was incredibly unsatisfactory leaving me with no intention of ever revisiting despite availing a groupon deal i unexpectedly incurred extra charges and had to tolerate a rude and unhelpful waiter who also held a supervisory role their lack of proper customer service skills disappointed me greatly thankfully the owner of mezzo managed to mitigate the damage by resolving the issue but this does not change my decision to steer clear of the establishment in hindsight i should have chosen olive garden or carrabas for higherquality cuisine and superior service moreover mezzo disappointingly watered down their wines and charged absurdly high prices for subpar offerings i strongly urge anyone contemplating dining there to save their hardearned money as the experience falls short of being worthwhile,0
basically we had reserved a spot for a group of 20 people but in the end there were 21 of us at first glance the empty terrace when we arrived seemed like a solvable issue however the owner informed us that due to an agreement with the neighbors and to reduce noise he couldnt allow us to sit as one big group of 21 at a single table on the terrace we were left with either splitting our group into two or moving inside to a table for 22 this led to a long discussion between the event organizers and the owner who refused to make any concessions despite us being a relatively calm group not exactly a rowdy university football team if you catch my drift,1
me and my family indulged in an amazing pepperoni and sausage pie with great flavors featuring a justright thickness for the crust your efforts are commendable  continue doing well and may luck be on your side,3
witnessing an impressive collection of diverse jerky varieties such as beef turkey and ostrich has left me awestruck notably the country butcher beef jerky reigns supreme and is unanimously hailed as the ultimate beef jerky known to mankind daring anyone to present a jerky that surpasses its rich flavors tenderness and juiciness seems fitting moreover the staff consistently excels in providing topnotch customer service with their warm and welcoming demeanor the only drawback of visiting the beef jerky store is that im invariably compelled to buy more than initially intended due to the irresistibly delectable assortment of not just jerky but also nuts candies and more do stop by and explore this enticing haven of gourmet delights,4
although i would have rated them with much praise if my kids had complete control their overall score ends up being 5 stars however due to the staffs lack of friendliness it has justified a slightly lower rating of 4 stars initially i was contemplating a mere 2 stars as the rates for play are quite steep apologies but charging 23 for an hourlong session for both of my kids or 35 for two hours feels unreasonable especially when theres an alternative like makutus with unlimited access at a similar cost inevitably well only have jump street and similar establishments to consider once my kids outgrow makutus nevertheless were currently enjoying the array of offerings available here and how delightful it is to witness my children actively participating while having a good time hence after thoughtful consideration a final rating of 3 stars seems fitting,2
when it comes to pizza i must say that nothing beats the deep dish masterpiece at this exceptional restaurant located in the east valley it is by far the finest ive ever savored since moving out east and i cannot recommend it enough the attentive and friendly staff further elevate the dining experience if you intend to eat at the restaurant it is advisable to place an advance order for the deep dish pizzas because they require a considerable amount of time to cook nevertheless the end result makes every minute of waiting absolutely worthwhile,4
i really wish i had a perfect place for ramen back at home,3
the food served at this establishment is truly dreadful  it arrives cold and i actually observed a worker picking up chow mein scraps that customers had dropped onto the counter only to place them back into the pan disgusting doesnt begin to describe it and i now realize my mistake in still choosing to dine there despite the warning signs from previous reviews it turns out i couldnt have been more wrong about it not being that bad,0
as part of the dinner show package deals we decided to try out the stratosphere buffet for just an additional 5 prior to watching the american superstars show we dined at this buffet with low expectations due to its affordability and limited food options commonly associated with the strip buffets to our pleasant surprise the stratosphere buffet offered a wide selection of delicious food items we particularly enjoyed their moist and flavorful rolled up bass fish fillet the only downside was the delay in service as our waiter failed to clear our dishes until they had accumulated on our table,3
we indulged in a fantastic pepperoni and sausage pie  full of incredible flavors and with a crust that was perfectly balanced in terms of thickness please accept our compliments for a job well done and we wish you all the luck in the world,3
great pie me and the family had a pepperoni and sausage pie that was awesome great flavor crust wasnt to thick or thin just right nkeep up the good work guys and good luck,3
its undeniable that the food is fantastic and the selection of drinks is highly commendable nevertheless a common complaint is the considerable amount of time it takes to receive a beverage even during offpeak hours is there room for improvement by introducing a more efficient approach to serving drinks all while ensuring the continued excellent service of the amicable servers and warm welcome provided by the hostesses,2
without a doubt this eatery in the east valley serves the most outstanding pizza i have ever had i wholeheartedly recommend their deep dish option which has been the best ive experienced since living out east additionally the staff is extremely amiable if you decide to dine in make sure to order the deep dish pizzas ahead of time so they can be prepared properly although the cooking process might take a while i assure you that it is definitely worth the wait,4
i was finally able to give this place a shot today and i was very disappointed prior to eating here i knew from other reviews that the service wasnt the best but i wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion however i got there and received some of the worst service ive ever gotten right off the bat the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all  it seemed like he didnt want to be working i asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because i saw lunch special written on one of the laminated pictures and he rudely replied with no lunch specials okay thennni paid with my debit card and they do it with an ipad making you pay tip while theyre pointing the ipad at you which i thought was a bit rude i gave 15 but i shouldnt have because this guy was extremely rude and they dont serve you at all its all self service also i asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup but when i received my food there were green onions on top so i said i had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying thats not onions you didnt tell me no green onions you just said onions and i replied with theyre still onions i said no onions i thought that was very clear and he replied with you need to specify what you want and i just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where i just took the food because i didnt want anymore trouble and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as i was leaving if i had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying i had none i just didnt like them this was so rude because he doesnt know me what if i did have allergies nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that i didnt specify what kind of onions i didnt want when i didnt know there were two different types of onions in the soup nnso needless to say i probably wont be returning to the restraunt unless im having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food,0
since no one in this town seems to stock highquality memory cards we had to go to 5 different stores before ending up at staples i needed a new card urgently and didnt have time to wait for shipping staples had a suitable card in terms of file transfer speed but it was not the size i required consequently i ended up purchasing two cards however the cashier seemed unaware of the stores return policy and vaguely mentioned that returns might be possible after swiping our credit card it failed to read requiring us to swipe again this incident reminded us of a previous experience where our card was double charged in jest my boyfriend and i asked what we should do if it happens again but the cashier had no answer simply suggesting we call the store although the store was clean wellorganized and seemingly stocked with various items we did not explore further as i only needed the memory cards nonetheless i would appreciate more knowledgeable staff or at the very least an appearance of genuine concern,2
at 1130 i came to this location only to find nobody there and the music playing was of poor quality the volume was so low that my friends and i could easily engage in a thorough conversation inside the club when you can hear your friends talking clearly from a distance you can tell that the situation is unfavorable luckily i had the advantage of being on the guest list since they impose a 20 fee on people who dont reside in las vegas,0
when this restaurant first opened we were excited to be there the food was fantastic and we had reasons to come back however it feels like they sacrificed their authentic italian touch just to attract a full house every night i sincerely hope that the owners will start focusing on improving the taste of their italian pasta dishes the only redeeming factor at rotellis is their delicious garlic knots and the quality of their pizza remains unchanged,1

the joy i felt upon learning that a culvers would finally grace the carolinas only minutes away from my house cannot be described having moved here from wisconsin i had high hopes for this latest addition to the chain regrettably after making numerous trips to this particular outlet it consistently falls short of the exceptional standards ive grown accustomed to when indulging in culvers fare back in wisconsin on multiple occasions my order has been botched and today was the icing on the cake as my burger was swimming in so much grease that it practically arrived served in a puddle despite my optimism about future improvements for this new location things havent improved yet maybe just maybe ill be willing to give it another shot but i wont be going out of my way any time soon to return there,1
without a doubt this restaurant in the east valley serves the most exceptional pizza i have ever come across my highest recommendation goes to their mouthwatering deepdish variety since i moved to the east i havent tasted anything as good as this furthermore the staff here is incredibly friendly if youre planning to dinein make sure to preorder the tempting deepdish pizzas well in advance yes they do take quite some time to cook but trust me the taste makes every minute worthwhile,4
if my childrens opinions were the sole factor they would have received a 5star rating however i would have given them 4 stars if the staff had been more friendly the high prices almost made me give them only 2 stars unfortunately paying 23 for one hour of play for two kids or 35 for two hours seems excessive when compared to makutus unlimited playtime option eventually our only options will be jump street and activities similar to it despite this we currently appreciate the variety they offer it brings me joy to see my kids active and happy which is why ive settled on giving them 3 stars ,2
at approximately 1130 i came to this venue only to find nobody there and the music being played was truly unimpressive surprisingly my friends and i managed to have a meaningful conversation in the club without any difficulty as the music was barely audible to be honest when i can hear my friends speaking from a considerable distance you already know the situation is not favorable fortunately i felt relieved that i was included on the guest list considering they charge nonlas vegas residents 20,0
despite the convenience of this lowes being close to home i still find myself disappointed with the customer service here i may consider giving it 3 stars if my experiences improve,1
while the staffs demeanor was cordial their efficiency levels were lacking comparable to someone who had sustained a significant head injury and consequently struggled to perform tasks at a normal pace additionally given the relatively simple nature of the breakfast order there were an unexpectedly high number of mistakes nevertheless the quality of the food itself was tolerable,2
i say this every time but now i mean it im through with buffets  why then do i keep coming backnnmaybe i just cant shake the lure of quantity even though i know in my enlarged heart that the old expression jack of all trades master of none is basically the rule at these feeding frenziesnnbuffets are like the dixie chicksat first youre overwhelmed by numbers but upon further examination nothing really looks good close upnnthat being said as far as buffets go this one is pretty good  with nice touches from mini chinese food takeaway containers in the asian food section to the cute milk servers for your coffee wicked spoon hits the stage  but alas when youre cooking for 1000 people an hour love goes out the window  things are generically prepared and generally lacking in seasoning but thats understandable when trying to appeal to so many varied tastesnnif youre in your 20s and you and your buddies just threw on your fancy jobinterview sweats and sandals to chow down in the waning moments before breakfast turns to lunch this is the place  but if you actually enjoy those subtle things like flavor or of you think a chef preparing your dish the way you like it is not just a euro fad take the advice i gave at the beginning and proudly proclaim im through with buffets,2
although this lowes is conveniently located near my house the poor customer service continues to disappoint me if the staff can serve me better i might think about giving it a higher rating of 3 stars otherwise i will make an effort to visit a different lowes store when possible,1
if only there was a perfect ramen spot nearby when im back home,3
this establishment lacks any merchandise associated with kitkat occupying two floors solely dedicated to insulinrelated items notably the store stands out due to its exceptional cleanliness and the amiability of its staff however if your intention is to procure standard candy bars this particular store might not meet your expectations unless you have an interest in unique or personalized varieties moreover all candy prices within the store exceed those found elsewhere making them comparatively expensive a curious factor that caught my attention was the artificial smell of chocolate permeating the store although not unpleasant it deviated from the familiar aroma typically linked to the hersheys brand resembling instead the nostalgic scent of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood ultimately it belongs to the category of places that leaving after one visit is perfectly acceptable,2
my utmost desire is to witness the prosperity of a thriving british pub in phoenix especially considering my ancestral heritage spanning generations in england wales ireland and scotland regrettably despite showing potential the current establishment fails to meet expectations in several areas admittedly it has a charmingly divey atmosphere which can be appealing in its own right furthermore their beer selection is commendable attracting a diverse crowd that enjoys good music and a plethora of sports on television however the staff lacks sufficient training and fails to anticipate the needs of guests for instance we attempted to order happy hour food at 655 pm only to be dismissed with claims that it had already ended even though official closing time was still a few minutes away at 7 pm similarly another customer experienced frustration while waiting for takeout food despite constant inquiries about its progress the request miraculously materialized after an excruciating wait of 40 minutes in terms of service they manage decently for a bar but difficulties arise when it comes to delivering a satisfying culinary experience their menu boasts an extensive array of options but unfortunately not all are successful during one visit we tasted disappointment with sunday roast although it arrived accompanied by a generous portion of vegetables mashed potatoes and a massive yorkshire pudding the beef lacked the expected roasted flavor resembling something closer to cheap steak slices instead to further dismay the gravy seemed to come from a jar rather than being meticulously crafted such shortcomings are disconcerting as a wellprepared sunday roast holds symbolic value to the english comparable to thanksgiving dinner in the us on another occasion similar experiences dampened our enthusiasm when ordering scotch eggs while the dish came with a tantalizing assortment of accompaniments the centerpiece disappointingly featured an excessively thick and dry casing despite these flaws my longing for this place to flourish persists the conceptual menu promises an elevated dining experience but it falls short in execution perhaps the local market settles for mediocrity but i have been fortunate enough to enjoy far more inspired cuisine in california transcending mere british fare,1
this store is an excellent option for discovering oneofakind presents or items to enhance the appearance of your living space nancy possesses remarkable skills in interior decoration capable of giving your home a stunning holiday transformation or completely redesigning any room they offer an extensive collection including soughtafter collectibles like sid dickens and woof poof as well as custom iron pieces for fireplace artwork potpourri and much more my daughter thoroughly enjoyed browsing through the beautiful vera bradley products and even found a pen she absolutely adored,4
the quality of the food is abysmal  its cold and to make matters worse i witnessed a worker scooping up chow mein that others had dropped on the counter and putting it back into the pan this act was utterly repulsive definitely not deserving even one star im ashamed that i ignored the negative reviews and thought that the restaurant couldnt possibly be as terrible as described,0
it would be amazing if there was a great ramen place back home,3
im uncertain about the recent decline in customer service as there has been a noticeable drop in quality over the past few weeks i wonder if this is due to a change in ownership or management as the staff now seems lacking in knowledge and expertise i wouldnt return even if they offered to pay me,0
the food is amazing and the drink options are exceptional but one drawback is the considerable wait time for beverages even when there are very few people present can anything be done to expedite the service of drinks while still maintaining the friendly servers and welcoming hostesses,2
bluburger has become our goto place having left us thoroughly satisfied on two separate occasions what sets them apart is the incredible array of meat choices cheese varieties and mouthwatering condiment options among the numerous combinations weve tried one standout creation featured succulent kobe beef complemented by rich cheddar tangy roasted red pepper mayo perfectly caramelized onions and other delicious ingredients this culinary marvel embodies the epitome of gourmet burger dining in chandler moreover bluburger ensures complete customer fulfillment by offering a wellstocked bar with an extensive drink collection to pair with your meal,4
i decided to give this new nail salon a try and im so glad i did the staff was incredibly friendly and the quality of their work was topnotch kevin did an exceptional job on my pedicure and i also got my eyebrows done which turned out fabulous,4
i had a positive experience using kellys glass for a repair a few years ago but im uncertain about their current situation i contacted them on a wednesday morning to explain the repair needed and was informed that the residential staff would call me after 9am however i didnt receive any communication throughout the day to confirm my appointment i called again later in the afternoon they assured me that the residential staff would contact me the following day at 9am unfortunately i waited all day without hearing back from kellys frustrated i decided to reach out to another company on friday who promptly sent someone on monday its concerning that i havent received any updates from kellys leading me to question the state of their business and if they are not interested in new customers,0
within this venue there exists a conspicuous absence of any kitkat merchandise instead the premises encompass two floors entirely focused on insulinrelated products a notable feature is the exceptional level of cleanliness maintained by the store further complemented by the courtesy and friendliness exhibited by the staff members nonetheless unless you specifically seek out novelty or personalized variations this store may not be your preferred destination for purchasing traditional candy bars its worth mentioning that the prices of all the confectionery items available inside surpass what you would find elsewhere making them comparatively expensive one particular aspect that caught my attention was the artificial chocolate aroma constantly diffused throughout the store although overshadowing the familiar scent associated with the hersheys brand it evoked instead memories of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood all in all this is one of those places where paying a single visit is sufficient as there is no strong urge to return,2
i would love to see a thriving british pub in phoenix since i have a strong english welsh irish and scottish heritage however although this place has potential it falls short in several aspects it has a divey atmosphere but thats okay the beer selection is excellent and the crowd is diverse with good music and plenty of sports on tv on the downside the staff lacks adequate training and fails to anticipate customer needs for example we tried to order happy hour food at 655 pm but they claimed it was already over even though happy hour ends at 7 pm another customer ordered takeout food and waited for 40 minutes constantly asking about it until it mysteriously appeared all boxed up generally the service is decent for a bar but the food aspect seems to be problematic the menu offers a wide range of options but there are both hits and misses during one visit we had sunday roast which came with generous side dishes but the beef tasted more like steakums than roasted meat the gravy seemed to be from a jar which is disappointing because sunday roast beef is highly regarded by the english similarly the scotch eggs served on another night had a thick and dry casing despite being accompanied by various extras while i want this place to succeed it just doesnt quite deliver when it comes to food perhaps the market doesnt demand better but ive had much more inspired cuisine in california not just in the uk,1
our experience at bluburger has been exceptional on two occasions already i adore the assortment of meat cheese and condiments available one burger that particularly stood out was a delectable combination of kobe beef cheddar roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more it truly exemplified gourmet dining in chandler additionally its worth noting that bluburger boasts a fullystocked bar,4
after searching for a new nail salon i decided to give this one a try and i absolutely love it the staff is friendly and their work is topnotch kevin did an amazing job on my pedicure and i also had my eyebrows done which turned out great,4
another time we ordered their scotch eggs which sounded promising but ended up being unusual the casing was dry and an inch thick although the extras served with it were diverse ,1
very good steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts the view from the patio is definitely worth the wait standard french bistro food catered to an american audience,4
i arrived at this location at 1130 but it was empty and the music was terrible my friends and i were able to have a full conversation in the club because the volume was so low honestly if i can hear my friends talking from far away you know its bad im relieved that i was on the guest list because they charge 20 for people who dont live in las vegas,0
it was truly exhilarating to find out that a culvers was opening near my home in the carolinas as i hail from wisconsin however after several visits to this particular location i have consistently felt let down because it fails to live up to the high standards i have when visiting culvers establishments in wisconsin my order has been incorrect on multiple occasions and today my burger was excessively greasy so much so that it was served to me in a pool of grease despite hoping for improvement due to it being a new location it hasnt met my expectations thus far perhaps i will give it another try but i dont plan on making a special trip to return there anytime soon,1
today provided me with an opportune moment to finally give this place a try but unfortunately it left me thoroughly disappointed prior to visiting i had heard through various reviews that the level of service here was subpar but i aimed to form my own unbiased opinion without allowing others judgments to sway me however from the very outset i had the displeasure of encountering some of the most appalling service imaginable the young man manning the counter displayed an unwelcoming demeanor and seemed disinterested in his role when i inquired about any lunch specials having noticed the term on a laminated picture his reply was abrupt and downright rude no adding to my dissatisfaction the payment process involved an ipad where they expected me to input a tip amount while pointing the device directly at me which struck me as rather impolite despite these unfavorable circumstances i still left a 15 tip although i now realize that it wasnt warranted given the extreme level of rudeness displayed by the staff additionally its noteworthy to mention that this establishment operates strictly on a selfservice basis there is no table service whatsoever furthermore despite clearly stating my preference for no onions in my tofu soup when my order arrived i discovered green onions sprinkled on top politely voicing my concern i mentioned that i had specifically asked for no onions the person who took my initial order immediately became defensive and countered by saying that those werent regular onions and that i hadnt specified not wanting green onions to which i firmly responded that irrespective of the type they are still onions and i had indeed stated no onions by this point my frustration with him had reached its limit so i reluctantly decided to accept the food without further argument as i was leaving the woman who handed me the food asked the man if i had an allergy to onions only to receive a rude reply that i didnt i just didnt like them this comment struck me as incredibly disrespectful because he doesnt know anything about my personal preferences or potential allergies and even if i did have an allergy its not his place to insinuate blame or make me feel guilty about it moreover it was unnecessary for him to put the onus on me for not specifying what kind of onions i didnt want when i had no knowledge that there were different types used in the soup taking everything into account unless an overwhelming craving for their mediocre korean cuisine suddenly arises i highly doubt that ill ever choose to return to that restaurant again,0
i have never seen a more extensive assortment of jerky including beef turkey ostrich and more one standout is the country butcher beef jerky which is widely regarded as the finest beef jerky in existence i challenge anyone to find a tastier more succulent and flavorful jerky additionally the staff at this store consistently provides exceptional service and is incredibly friendly the only downside is that i often end up purchasing more items than planned because everything they offer from jerky to nuts and candies is simply irresistible dont miss out on experiencing it for yourself,4
for several years my family and i have been regular customers at this restaurant but lately weve noticed a decline in the food quality except for their pizza due to its central location rotellis has become a goto gathering place for our family celebrations particularly on birthdays unfortunately our most recent visit confirmed our ongoing disappointment with their pasta offerings the baked ziti i ordered lacked any discernible flavor and similarly the sauce was disappointingly bland this lack of taste is not an isolated incident weve encountered the same issues with their ravioli and linguine with clam sauce  both lacking any semblance of flavor whats troubling is that even my 16yearold son who typically eats anything placed in front of him couldnt bear to finish his chicken parm due to the awfultasting sauce despite our inclination to send the two dishes back for improvement the restaurants bustling atmosphere made it impractical to do so its disheartening to witness how the initial excitement we had when rotellis first opened has gradually faded as a result of the unappetizing italian pasta dishes they now serve one silver lining is that the garlic knots remain an exception  they are still utterly delicious similarly the pizza hasnt suffered the same decline in quality as the pasta entrées despite our repeated attempts to give rotellis another chance theyve consistently failed to deliver satisfactory pasta dishes its astonishing that not one single pasta dish lived up to our expectations regrettably im sure that i will find myself going back to rotellis especially on family members birthdays however when celebrating the birthdays of my immediate family members we prefer exploring the plethora of superior italian eateries available in the area dont boycott this place if youre a fan of their mouthwatering garlic knots and tasty pizza just stay away from the overpriced and lackluster pasta dishes  they simply fall short,1
in the end we were all too stuffed to try any of their desserts but we unanimously agreed that it would be worth another trip to vegas just for their sweet treats overall if youre a foodie like me you simply must try their corn croquettes they are hands down the best ive ever had the burrito is delicious but be prepared for its small size it left me full but only because i ended up finishing part of my sisters breakfast skillet,3
today i finally got the chance to give this place a try and it ended up being a huge disappointment despite knowing from other reviews that their service wasnt great i didnt let that influence my opinion beforehand however as soon as i walked in i experienced some of the worst service ever the young man at the counter was very unwelcoming and seemed like he didnt even want to be working there when i asked him about lunch specials since i saw it mentioned on one of the laminated pictures he rudely responded with no lunch specials then when i paid with my debit card they use an ipad where you have to add the tip right in front of them which i found quite rude i ended up giving a 15 tip but i shouldnt have because of how rude the guy was moreover they dont serve you at all everything is selfservice additionally i specifically requested no onions in my tofu soup but when i received it there were green onions on top so i told them that i had asked for no onions and the person who took my order gave me attitude saying that i never mentioned green onions just onions i explained that green onions are still onions and he responded by saying that i should have specified what exactly i didnt want at that point i was already annoyed and decided to just accept the food as is as i didnt want any more trouble as i was leaving the woman who handed me my food asked the guy if i had an onion allergy to which he replied that i had none i just didnt like them this was incredibly rude because he doesnt know me nor was it necessary for him to make it seem like it was my fault for not specifying the type of onions i didnt want especially when i didnt even know there were different types in the soup all in all unless i have an intense craving for their mediocre korean food i highly doubt ill be returning to this restaurant,0
bluburger has become a regular haunt for us as weve already dined there twice each time leaving us completely satisfied the array of meat cheese and condiment combinations available is simply exquisite during our most recent visit i had the pleasure of savoring an extraordinary burger crafted with kobe beef cheddar cheese roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more delectable ingredients this burger is the epitome of gourmet goodness truly embodying the highest level of culinary expertise one can find in chandler to top it all off dont forget that bluburger also boasts an impressive selection of beverages at their full bar,4
customer service just went down in the last few weeks not sure what happened new ownership or management they dont seem to really know what theyre talking about couldnt pay me to go back,0
id have given them 5 stars if this was completely up to my kidsnid have given them 4 stars if the staff was friendlierni almost gave them 2 stars due to the high prices im sorry but 23 for my 2 kids to play for one hour 35 for 2hrs for that same amount they can play as long as they want at makutus of course very soon they will outgrow makutus and this and jump street will be our only choice for this type of activity for now were enjoying the varietynbut oh how i love to see my kids sweat and enjoy themselves while they do sonso ive settled on 3 stars,2
witness an unparalleled assortment of jerkies encompassing beef turkey ostrich and beyond at this remarkable beef jerky store specifically dont miss the chance to try their renowned country butcher beef jerky – easily hailed as the superior choice among all beef jerkies available today dare any skeptic to present a more enchanting tender and succulent jerky experience furthermore expect nothing less than toptier service from the stores exemplary and exceptionally friendly staff just one caveat beware of leaving the premises with a significantly larger purchase than initially intended as every item here from jerkies to nuts and candies is irresistibly delicious discover the wonders of this store for yourself,4
my family and i have dined here for several years and the food has definitely fallen to sub par except the pizza  rotellis is a family gathering place for us as it is centrally located  so we end up there for birthdays  nnwent there again last night for a birthday and as usual the pasta was not good at all  i had the baked ziti and only nibbled on it  the sauce was so bland  ive also had the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce  yuck  no taste at all  my 16 year old son who will eat anything stopped halfway through his chicken parm and said he couldnt eat anymore because the sauce tasted terrible  if the restaurant hadnt been packed we would have sent the two dishes backnnwhen this restaurant first opened we were enthusiastic  the food was very good and we had reason to go  its as if they sold their italian soul in order to have a full house every night  its my wish that the owners would start paying attention to their italian pasta dishes and get the taste back  the garlic knots are definitely the best thing about this restaurant  and the pizza hasnt suffered eithernnive given rotellis chance after chance and theyve failed every time  its amazing that not one pasta dish tasted good  nnunfortunately im sure i will go back   if its another family members birthday we end up at rotellis  when its one of my immediate family members birthday we go somewhere else there are far better italian eateries in the areanndont boycott this place if you love garlic knots and pizza  they are very good  just stay away from the tasteless and expensive pasta dishes  they suck,1
the service was friendly but exceedingly slow as though someone had a severe head injury that impacted their speed additionally there were an excessive number of errors for such a small breakfast order however the quality of the food was satisfactory,2
the baguette company on dalry road is known for being more up to date than most other cafes and takeaways despite mainly focusing on takeaway food its ambience is clean fresh modern and spacious the menu includes soft baguettes with reasonable prices and ample toppings i personally rate the fillings highly this place doesnt go overboard with mayo like some others might if you have lunch here youll be satisfied without feeling overly full i would choose to bring my business here over baguette express or subway because its a little bit better i have no complaints and its especially convenient for commuters from haymarket station,3
while i initially had the intention of awarding them 3 stars my opinion has now been swayed due to the possibility of improved experiences the customer service offered at this particular store is abysmal  the employees are complacent disengaged and provide no support to the customers and sometimes they even display disrespectful behavior after all they are paid to perform their duties efficiently despite these grievances i still frequent this lowes store often because of its convenient location near my home especially when i am deeply immersed in my gardening activities and urgently require assistance consequently i will continue being a customer here however if my interactions with the employees become more satisfactory it is not entirely impossible for me to consider raising my rating to 3 stars nevertheless whenever the circumstances allow i will make an effort to visit an alternative lowes store,1
weve visited bluburger twice now and each time has been nothing short of delightful the range of options for meats cheeses and toppings is impressive one memorable burger i had was made with juicy kobe beef layered with sharp cheddar luscious roasted red pepper mayo sweet caramelized onions and much more it was an absolute treat showcasing the pinnacle of burger artistry in chandler and lets not forget bluburger also offers a comprehensive selection of beverages at their full bar,4
this place doesnt sell any kitkat merchandise and its divided into two floors dedicated to insulin the store is extremely clean and has a friendly staff but its not exactly the goto spot for buying candy bars unless youre interested in personalized or novelty options moreover all the candy prices are higher than what you can find elsewhere one peculiar thing i noticed was that the store had a fake chocolate smell which wasnt exactly unpleasant but didnt resemble the typical hersheys scent instead it reminded me of those scratchandsniff stickers from childhood overall its one of those places you can visit once and be fine with never returning,2
i long for a perfect ramen spot to exist in the area where i live,3
this is a great store for finding unique gifts or pieces to spruce up your home  nancy is a very talented home decorator who can transform your home for the holidays or give any room a complete redesignnnthey have collectibles like sid dickens and woof  poof as well as custom iron pieces for your fireplace artwork potpourri and morennmy daughter loved looking at all the vera bradley and found a pen she just couldnt live without,4
i find myself repeating this statement over and over but now i genuinely mean it  i am officially breaking up with buffets so why do i keep finding myself drawn to them perhaps its my weakness for unlimited options even though ive come to realize that the saying jack of all trades master of none often rings true in these overwhelming food extravaganzas,2
service was friendly but slow like bumped her head too hard slow too many errors for such a small breakfast order  food was okay,2
i was overjoyed when i found out that culvers was opening a branch near my home in the carolinas as i am originally from wisconsin however after visiting this location multiple times i have consistently been disappointed by the quality the experience falls short of my expectations compared to visiting a culvers in wisconsin my order has been incorrect on several occasions and today my burger was so greasy that it arrived soaked in a pool of grease despite hoping that things would improve since it is a new establishment my experiences thus far have not been satisfactory perhaps i will give it another chance but i dont foresee making a special trip to return to this location anytime soon,1
anyway i might give this place a second chance but the owners uncompromising and somewhat haughty attitude doesnt particularly encourage me well see,1
for just 5 more included in our dinner show package we took advantage of the opportunity to dine at the stratosphere buffet before attending the american superstars show we figured we should have something to eat initially i had concerns about the quality of food being offered assuming it would be one of those budget buffets along the strip with very limited food choices however my expectations were exceeded when i discovered the impressive variety and taste of the dishes available at the stratosphere buffet notably the rolledup bass fish fillet was incredibly moist and flavorful the only drawback we encountered was the lack of attention from our waiter who neglected to clear our plates until they accumulated into a small stack on our table despite this minor annoyance overall it turned out to be a pleasant dining experience,3
the patio offers a remarkable view definitely worth waiting for while enjoying excellent steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts all served in a french bistro style that caters to the american palate,4
i used kellys glass a couple of years ago for a repair and was pleased  not sure what is going on there now  i called early on a wednesday morning and explained the repair i needed  was told the residential person would be in at 9am and would call me  waited all day and didnt hear anything  called again late afternoon wednesday to make sure they still had me on their list  was told yes the residential person would be in at 9am the following day and would call me  waited again all day no call back from kellys  gave up and called another company on friday which sent someone out first thing on monday  still havent heard back from kellysnndont know what the story is with this company  they apparently dont need any new business,0
when i got here around 1130 there wasnt anyone present and the music was awful me and my friends had no trouble having a complete conversation in the club because the music wasnt even playing at a high volume to tell the truth if i could clearly hear my friends from a distance you know its not good its fortunate that i was on the guest list since nonlas vegas residents are charged 20,0
even though i constantly say im done with buffets theres something about the abundance and variety that keeps pulling me back its like i cant resist the allure of quantity even though deep down i know that most times these allyoucaneat feasts lack true quality,2
the service at mezzo left much to be desired  it was truly awful despite using a groupon i ended up getting hit with extra charges not only that but our waiter turned out to be the supervisor and he had an incredibly unpleasant demeanor his lack of good customer service skills made the experience even worse thankfully the owner of mezzo stepped in and managed to defuse the situation somehow still i cant help but wish i had opted for somewhere like olive garden or carrabas where the food and service are known to be better on top of everything mezzo had the nerve to water down their wine while charging excessively high prices for anyone reading this i strongly advise you to save your hardearned money and look elsewhere  mezzo simply isnt worth it,0
since none of the stores in this town carry highquality memory cards we ended up at staples after visiting five different stores i needed a new card urgently and couldnt wait for shipping a betterpriced one with higher speed the card at staples had good file transfer speed but not the size i needed so i had to buy two cards unfortunately the girl at the checkout had no knowledge about the return policy and could only say i think you can return this um okay we swiped our credit card but it didnt read properly forcing us to swipe it again last time when this happened our card got double charged so my boyfriend and i jokingly asked what to do if it gets double charged again the cashier had no idea and just said um call the store the store itself was clean wellorganized albeit empty we didnt have time to explore as i only needed the memory cards but im sure they had lots of great things there it would be nice if the staff were more knowledgeable or at least pretended to care,2
the level of friendliness displayed by the service staff was commendable however the slowness observed in their performance was comparable to someone having hit their head with great force furthermore the frequency of mistakes made during the preparation of a relatively small breakfast order was unexpectedly high despite these setbacks the taste and overall quality of the food were acceptable,2
the level of customer service seems to have declined over the past few weeks and im not quite sure why its possible that there has been a change in ownership or management because the current team doesnt appear to possess the necessary understanding or competence to be honest i wouldnt return to their establishment even if they compensated me,0
my purpose for attending the event was a professional 5 à 7 gathering and i must confess that it failed to leave a lasting impression being committed to maintaining a positive outlook let us commence by acknowledging the positive aspects  both the outdoor terrace and the interior were aesthetically pleasing moreover the establishment offered a satisfactory selection of beers however my experience remained incomplete as i did not partake in a full meal therefore i cannot bestow judgment on the culinary aspect which may significantly affect my overall evaluation to be perfectly impartial i would consider revisiting the venue at some point to update my appraisal alas i am highly skeptical that such an opportunity will arise due to the unfortunate incident involving our reservation initially we had booked a table for a party of 20 individuals but unexpectedly found ourselves with an additional guest resulting in a total of 21 attendees at first glance this dilemma seemed resolvable since the terrace was unoccupied upon our arrival nonetheless the proprietor explained that mitigating noise levels and adhering to a neighborly agreement precluded seating a group of 21 together at a single large table on the terrace we were left with two choices either divide our party into two or relocate indoors to occupy a table designed for 22 guests this predicament led to a protracted discussion between the organizers of the event and the owner who adamantly declined any compromise despite our groups docile nature  it is worth noting that we were far from being rowdy similar to the football team of mcgill university metaphorically speaking consequently a small trio sought separate seating arrangements while one of the remaining 18 individuals departed to catch their commuter train fifteen minutes later the three excluded members rejoined our larger group candidly in my modest opinion this entire affair took on the characteristics of a genuine theatrical comedy rather than reflecting a customercentric approach in conclusion i may toy with the notion of granting this establishment a second chance however the dogmatic and somewhat haughty demeanor exhibited by the owner fails to inspire personal enthusiasm only time will tell what my ultimate decision shall be,1
by far the best pizza ive had in the east valley i highly recommend the deep dish best ive had since living out east and the staff are very friendly if you intend to eat in the restaurant order deep dish pizzas ahead of time like a true deep dish they cook for quite a long time but are well worth the wait,4
within the last couple of weeks the quality of customer service has taken a nosedive and i cant seem to figure out why maybe theres a new owner or manager in charge who lacks adequate knowledge as the employees understanding of their job seems inadequate frankly even if they paid me i wouldnt consider revisiting their business,0
by the end of our brunch feast we were too full to indulge in any of their desserts however we unanimously decided that another trip to vegas solely for their desserts would be well worth it overall if you visit this place for its food make sure to try their outstanding corn croquettes the burrito is certainly enjoyable but proceed with caution due to its smaller serving size lastly dont forget to leave room for their enticing desserts,3
prepare to be amazed by the extensive array of jerkies available at this beef jerky store – featuring flavors like beef turkey ostrich and others notably they also offer country butcher beef jerky widely acclaimed as the ultimate beef jerky challenge yourself to discover a more flavorful succulent and mouthwatering jerky anywhere else moreover the store boasts exceptional and genuinely friendly staff members however be forewarned that entering this establishment often results in buying far more items than initially planned due to the undeniable excellence of their products make sure to explore their selection which includes not only jerkies but also delectable nuts candies and much more,4
the greatest collection of jerky beef turkey ostrich etc ive ever witnessed they also sell country butcher beef jerky which is hands down the greatest beef jerky known to man i rival anyone to show me a more flavorful tender juicy jerky the staff has always been top notch and extremely friendly the only bad thing about the beef jerky store is that when i go there im overly compelled to buy way more stuff than i thought i would its all just so good  not only jerky but also nuts and candies and more check it out,4
i went for a 5 to 7 office gathering and i cant say that i was impressed i try to stay positive so lets start with the positives  the terrace and interior are nice and they have a decent beer selection however my experience wasnt complete as i didnt have a full meal so i cant comment on the food which could potentially change my rating if i wanted to be fair i would go back later and update my review but i doubt that will happen because of the incident with the reservation we had booked for a group of 20 but ended up being 21 initially it seemed like a solvable problem since the terrace was empty when we arrived but the owner explained that due to noise reduction and an agreement with the neighbors we couldnt have one big table for 21 on the terrace we either had to split our group into two or sit inside at a table for 22 there was a lengthy discussion between the organizers and the owner who refused to budge despite us being a fairly calm group not exactly the mcgill university football team if you catch my drift a small group of three of us sat separately while waiting for one of the other 18 to leave for their commuter train 15 minutes later the three excluded individuals joined us but honestly in my humble opinion this whole ordeal felt like a real comedy show and not a very customeroriented approach in short i might give the place a second chance but the owners uncompromising and somewhat haughty attitude doesnt really encourage me well see,1
todays lunch experience was just alright nothing to write home about the pizza had a pleasant taste with a good crust but it disappointed me with its soft middle and lack of toppings even though it was supposed to be a cheese pizza there was barely any cheese on it the service was a mixed bag  one worker had an excellent attitude but another cashier was terrible shouting at a coworker unnecessarily i have no desire to return,1
please dont boycott this place if you enjoy their garlic knots and pizza those are actually very good just steer clear of their tasteless and overpriced pasta dishes they are simply subpar,1
the wait will be rewarded with a breathtaking view from the patio complemented by an assortment of delectable dishes such as steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts prepared in classic french bistro fashion to satisfy the american clientele,4
dalry roads baguette company stands out from the majority of other cafes and takeaways due to its modernity despite being primarily focused on takeaway orders the establishment maintains a clean fresh and spacious environment customers can enjoy soft baguettes at reasonable prices with generous toppings personally i highly regard the quality of their fillings appreciating that they dont go overboard with mayo having lunch here fulfills hunger without causing any discomfort in comparison to baguette express or subway this place is definitely superior making it my preferred choice i have no complaints and its location near haymarket station is an added convenience,3
we had a fantastic pepperoni and sausage pie full of deliciousness which me and my family relished the crust was neither too thick nor too thin hitting the sweet spot keep up the great work guys and may success accompany you,3
i always say this but now i truly mean it  i am done with buffets so why do i keep going back perhaps i cant resist the allure of unlimited food even though deep down i know that buffets often offer quantity over quality buffets are like the dixie chicks  overwhelming at first glance but upon closer inspection nothing really stands out that being said compared to other buffets this one is pretty decent wicked spoon has nice details like mini chinese food containers and cute milk servers but when youre cooking for thousands of people every hour love goes out the window the dishes are generic and lack seasoning but thats understandable when catering to various tastes if youre in your 20s and just want a quick meal before breakfast turns into lunch this is the place but if you appreciate flavors and prefer a chef preparing your dish exactly how you like it then take my original advice and proudly declare that youre through with buffets,2
no kitkat merch nnthis place is 2 floors of the reason for insulinnnsuper clean and friendly staff this store isnt really the place one would buy candy bars unless you were looking for the noveltypersonalized type all the candy prices were higher than what you can find on the outside obviouslynnwhat struck me as odd was that the store piped in that fake chocolate smell it wasnt a bad smell but it wasnt a chocolate smell that i associated with the hersheys brand  more like the chocolate smell of those scratch  sniff stickers from your childhoodnnyet again one of those places where you can go to once and be cool with never going back to again,2
the food at this place is absolutely horrible its cold and the workers even put back dropped chow mein from the counter into the pan its incredibly disgusting not worth a single star i cant believe i still went there despite reading all the negative reviews clearly underestimating how bad it could be,0
i had used kellys glass a few years ago for a repair and had a positive experience however im unsure about their current situation when i called on a wednesday morning to explain the repair i needed i was informed that the residential specialist would contact me after arriving at 9am unfortunately i waited all day without any communication to confirm my appointment i called them again in the late afternoon on wednesday they assured me that the residential specialist would be available at 9am the next day and would reach out to me yet i once again waited throughout the entire day without receiving a call back from kellys glass frustrated i decided to contact another company on friday who promptly dispatched someone to assist me on monday as of now i still havent received any followup from kellys glass leaving me uncertain about their operations it seems like they may not require any new business,0
waiting patiently for a table on the patio will reward you with an exquisite vista and a scrumptious selection of steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts all crafted in the traditional french bistro fashion but with a distinct appeal to the american taste buds,4
discovering that a culvers was finally coming to town in the carolinas brought me great joy given that i am originally from wisconsin regrettably my visits to the nearby culvers branch have been consistently disappointing it fails to live up to the high expectations i have developed from frequenting culvers in wisconsin time and again my orders have been botched and todays burger was exceptionally greasy to the point where it arrived drenched in a puddle of grease despite my optimism that the experience would improve over time it has not lived up to my expectations thus far while i might give it another chance i am unlikely to make the effort to return to this specific location anytime soon,1
bruntsfield is home to charming small fashion boutiques and my personal favorite among them all is bohemia located in the heart of bruntsfield edinburgh bohemia is just a short stroll away from the city center making it a convenient option for shopping this store specializes in handcrafted garments that are not only beautiful but also known for their exceptional quality ensuring they will last for years apart from womens and childrens clothing bohemia also offers a selection of home and living goods they feature a wide range of designer labels including avoca anthology odd molly and american vintage whenever i visit this shop i love exploring all the different items on display one item that caught my eye recently is an old molly checkered blouse however with a price tag of around £150 im hesitant to make the purchase in addition to clothing bohemia also stocks luxurious bath and beauty products with the fragrant offerings from paul and joe being particularly delightful the friendly atmosphere inside the shop contributes to the overall pleasant shopping experience and the staff is always kind and ready to assist customers furthermore bohemia also carries a stunning collection of jewelry shoes and bags that are equally as exquisite as their clothes i look forward to returning to bohemia to indulge in some shopping once my budget allows or when they have a sale so that i can add some of their lovely knitwear pieces to my wardrobe,3
looking for a store with an amazing selection of distinctive gifts and captivating home accents look no further this store offers an array of treasures to spruce up your living space with nancys exceptional expertise as a talented home decorator you can trust her to create a breathtaking holiday ambiance in your home or revamp any room to perfection from coveted collectibles like sid dickens and woof poof to customized iron pieces for your fireplace artistic masterpieces alluring potpourri and so much more they have it all while exploring the store my daughter was especially drawn to the magnificent assortment of vera bradley items and ended up falling in love with a pen she just had to make her own,4
as someone born in the uk to ancestral roots in england wales ireland and scotland i have a deep desire to witness the success of a britishstyle pub in phoenix unfortunately although this establishment has some potential it falls short in certain areas its atmosphere leans towards divey which isnt necessarily a problem on the positive side they have an excellent beer selection and attract a diverse crowd with good music and plenty of sports on tv however the staff lacks sufficient training and fails to anticipate customers needs for instance we attempted to order happy hour food at 655 pm only to be told it had already ended even though it officially runs until 7 pm another customer experienced frustration while waiting for takeout food despite repeatedly inquiring about its status it magically appeared boxed up after 40 minutes of waiting in general the service is acceptable for a bar setting but issues arise when it comes to the quality of the food their menu covers a wide range of options but culinary successes are interspersed with disappointments during one visit we ordered sunday roast which was accompanied by a generous serving of vegetables mashed potatoes and a massive yorkshire pudding unfortunately the beef didnt resemble roasted meat it tasted more like steakums additionally the gravy seemed to be storebought rather than lovingly prepared this is disheartening because to the english a wellexecuted sunday roast is akin to a thanksgiving dinner in the us a similar pattern occurred with their scotch eggs on another occasion while the dish boasted various complementary ingredients the core food item had an oddly thick and dry casing despite these shortcomings i genuinely wish this venue would excel it offers an enticing menu conceptually but falls short in delivering a satisfying dining experience perhaps the local market is content with mediocrity but ive been fortunate to enjoy much more inspired cuisine in california not just in the uk,1
dont fret over the wait because the stunning scenery from the patio coupled with mouthwatering steak frites flavorsome onion soup delectable cocktails and tempting desserts make the dining experience akin to a standard french bistro that caters to the preferences of the american diners,4
one of the girls in our group went for the chocolate chai tea and she claimed it was the best chai tea she has ever had since ive never tried chai tea before i decided to give it a go and i have to admit it was pretty yummy the chai flavor was strong and it definitely left a good impression on a firsttimer like me,3
i would like to give this place 3 stars but the customer service is terrible the employees are slow unhelpful and sometimes rude,1
came here for brunch on one of these vegas trips and what did i fall in love with not their chocolate no but their corn croquettes i normally dont go for fried food but my party wanted to try them so why not they were amazing the fried outside was surprisingly light and crisp and the inside was gooey with cheese and corn goodness the sauce was addicting i had to stop myself from licking off the plate it was so good it was like a mayo type sauce but 100 times better nndrinksni should say im not a huge fan of chocolate in general but i wasnt about to be the debbie downer of the group and i never shy away from trying something at least once so i was a good sport and tried the mexican spicy hot chocolate the server of course asked if i wanted milk or dark chocolate and because i was feeling adventurous that day i asked for half milk and half dark bad idea sometimes being adventurous just doesnt pay off my hot chocolate came out to be spicy and bitter not a very good mix however one of the girls got the thick italian hot chocolate and that was delicious probably because it was all milk chocolate note to self never get a dark hot chocolate it just doesnt make any sense now that i think of it why would you choose a bitter flavor in a sweet drinknnanother girl in our group got the chocolate chai tea ive never had chai tea before but my friend is an avid chai tea lover and she claimed that this was the best chai tea she has ever had i tried it and i must say the chai flavor is very strong and it was pretty yummy for a first timer im definitely getting this next timennfoodnwhen you begin looking at the extensive menu it can really be overwhelming because everything just sounds so good even for brunch i was torn among the breakfast skillet the cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast after party belgian waffle and the guilt free omelet i finally narrowed it down just to the savories because it was that kind of day i ended up choosing the burrito because other girls ordered the skillet and omelet when you think breakfast burrito you think big at least thats what i think when i order a breakfast burrito i imagine stuffing myself in egg cheese and whatever goodness is in the burrito to my huge disappointment the burrito came in a tiny serving i can almost compare it to an egg roll thats how disappointed i was however looks can be deceiving and thats exactly what i realized after my first bite the burrito came already cut into two and each opening was sprinkled with cinnamon or nutmeg it was a sweet spice that i couldnt decipher but it complimented the burrito well they used a red tortilla that was probably tomato flavored i couldnt tell because you really dont taste any special flavor from the tortilla nnthe burrito stuffing includes farm fresh eggs spicy chorizo tomato and pepper jack cheese its served with spiced home fries but i substituted it with the waffle fries my first bite was absolute heaven the perfect amount of egg cheese and sausage not too spicy and not at all too many flavors everything worked together and i just wanted to say good things do come in small packages sometimes nnthe breakfast skillet was a pretty large serving and it was absolutely what you would have expected an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushroom and their home fries its nothing new but still delicious if you want to be safe i would say the same about their omelet serving was big and it was expectedly a good omelet nnin the end we were too full to try any of their desserts but we all decided it was worth another trip to vegas just for their desserts one of these days overall if youre here for food you must try the corn croquettes the best ive ever had the burrito was delicious but order only if youre feeling adventurous and beware of the small portion i was full in the end but thats because i also ate part of my sisters breakfast skillet,3
i attended an official gathering scheduled from 5 pm to 7 pm at a workplace and i cannot honestly claim to have been blown away by the experience striving for a positive perspective let us begin with the merits  both the terrace and the interior of the venue were visually appealing and they offered a satisfactory range of beer choices however my encounter was incomplete since i did not indulge in a complete meal as a result i find myself unable to comment on the cuisine which could potentially significantly impact my overall rating to be fair i might consider revisiting the establishment later and updating my assessment nevertheless i am doubtful that such an opportunity will arise due to the unfortunate incident arising from our reservation initially we had made arrangements for a group of 20 individuals but unexpectedly ended up being 21 at first glance it appeared to be a solvable matter since the terrace stood vacant upon our arrival nonetheless the proprietor clarified that adhering to noise reduction measures and their agreement with neighbors precluded accommodating a single large table for 21 guests on the terrace we were confronted with two options either divide our group or relocate indoors to occupy a table intended for 22 people this dilemma sparked an extensive deliberation between the event organizers and the owner who adamantly refused to concede despite our composed demeanor  it is important to note that our tranquility was far from resembling the rowdiness of mcgill universitys football team metaphorically speaking consequently a small trio opted to sit separately while awaiting the departure of one of the other 18 attendees who needed to catch their suburban train fifteen minutes later the three excluded individuals rejoined our main group frankly in my humble opinion this entire ordeal resembled a genuine vaudeville production rather than embodying a customercentric approach in conclusion i might entertain the idea of returning to this place for a second chance however the owners unwavering and somewhat arrogant attitude does not particularly encourage me to do so time will reveal the ultimate verdict,1
a small group of three of us decided to sit separately while waiting for one of the other 18 attendees to leave for their suburban train after 15 minutes the excluded trio finally joined our group – it felt like a reality tv show situation honestly in my humble opinion this whole mishap was like a true vaudeville act and not very customeroriented,1
over the last few weeks the customer service has taken a nosedive leaving me puzzled about the reason behind this downfall whether its due to a shift in ownership or management one thing is for certain  they seem illinformed and incapable of providing satisfactory assistance even if they were to offer compensation i have no desire to return,0
having arrived at this place at 1130 it turned out to be empty and the music was absolutely disappointing despite that my friends and i were able to carry on a full conversation inside the club because the music wasnt loud enough to be frank if i can easily hear my friends talking from a distance then you know its a bad sign im really glad i was on the guest list because those who dont live in las vegas get charged 20,0
for lunch today i tried out this place and it left me with mixed feelings it was okay but it didnt leave me craving for more the pizza boasted a nice flavor with a satisfactory crust but it failed to impress me with its soggy middle and insufficient toppings i understand that it was a lunch special but calling it a cheese pizza when the cheese was scarce is disappointing as for the service one of the pizza makers seemed delightful but one of the cashiers was a nightmare loudly berating a fellow employee despite minimal customer traffic needless to say i wont be coming back,1
beholding the most magnificent assemblage of various jerkies comprising beef turkey ostrich and more has been a truly remarkable experience among them the undisputed champion is the country butcher beef jerky considered by many as the epitome of excellence in beef jerky craftsmanship challenging anyone to unveil a rival offering greater flavor tenderness and juiciness would indeed be a fascinating endeavor furthermore the dedicated and amiable staff consistently demonstrates exemplary professionalism and cordiality however the only downside to indulging in the gastronomic wonderland that is the beef jerky store is the perpetual temptation to exceed ones planned purchases due to the irresistibly sumptuous assortment of not just jerkies but also nuts candies and various other delectable goodies i highly recommend paying a visit and immersing yourself in this unparalleled gastronomic delight,4
ive given rotellis numerous opportunities but they have consistently disappointed me its astonishing how not a single pasta dish tasted good unfortunately i know i will still return whenever its a family members birthday we end up at rotellis but when its someone from my immediate family we choose to celebrate elsewhere because there are much better italian restaurants in the area,1
there is no kitkat merchandise available in this location as it consists of two floors dedicated to insulinrelated products the store is exceptionally clean and the staff members are friendly however if youre looking to purchase regular candy bars this store may not be your ideal choice unless youre interested in novelty or customized options additionally the prices for all types of candy are higher compared to what you would find elsewhere one peculiar aspect i noticed was that the store emitted an artificial chocolate fragrance which didnt resemble the typical hersheys scent but rather reminded me of the scratchandsniff stickers from childhood overall its one of those places where visiting once is sufficient and you wouldnt feel compelled to return,2
perfect ramen spot wish i had one back home,3
i attended a workrelated gathering from 5 pm to 7 pm and i must admit that i wasnt particularly impressed striving to maintain a positive attitude lets begin by focusing on the positives  the outdoor terrace is aesthetically pleasing and the interior is also welldecorated additionally they offer an acceptable variety of beers however my experience remained incomplete as i didnt have a full meal so i cannot provide feedback on the food which may significantly impact my overall assessment to be fair i could consider revisiting the venue at a later time to update my review but i highly doubt that will happen due to the incident surrounding our reservation initially we had made a reservation for a group of 20 people but unexpectedly ended up being 21 at first glance it appeared to be a manageable issue since the terrace was vacant when we arrived however the owner explained that due to noise reduction measures and a neighbor agreement accommodating a single table for 21 on the terrace was not feasible we were faced with the choice of splitting our group in half or occupying a table for 22 inside this predicament led to a prolonged discussion between the event organizers and the proprietor who adamantly refused to compromise despite our groups calm demeanor  please note that we were far from rowdy comparable to the mcgill university football team metaphorically speaking as a result a small group of three found alternative seating arrangements while waiting for one of the remaining 18 individuals to depart for their suburban train fifteen minutes later the three excluded members rejoined our group honestly in my humble opinion this entire misadventure resembled a true farce and did not reflect a particularly customercentric approach in conclusion i might entertain the idea of giving this establishment a second chance however the rigid and somewhat condescending attitude displayed by the business owner does little to bolster my enthusiasm the final verdict remains uncertain,1
the quality of the food and drink choices is outstanding however the issue lies with the delay in receiving drinks particularly when the restaurant is not crowded is it possible to find a solution that allows for faster beverage service without compromising the friendliness of the servers and welcoming atmosphere from the hostesses,2
terrible food sucks food is cold i watched a worker scoop up chow mein people had dropped on counter from pan and put it back into the pan disgusting doesnt even deserve 1 star i was the idiot that still went to this place even after reading these reviews thinking it couldnt be that bad boy was i wrong,0
my prior encounter with kellys glass for a repair assignment took place a few years back and it left me content nevertheless i find myself uncertain regarding the ongoing situation at the company one wednesday morning i contacted them to describe the nature of the repair required at that time i was informed that the residential representative would get in touch with me once they arrived by 9am however i waited all day and didnt receive a single call in an attempt to clarify the matter i phoned them again later in the afternoon on wednesday they assured me that the residential personnel would be available at 9am the following day and would reach out to me yet i faced another full day of waiting without receiving any communication from kellys glass consequently on friday i decided to abandon my pursuit and instead contacted another company who promptly sent someone to address my needs first thing monday morning to this day i havent received any response from kellys glass leaving me puzzled about their operations it seems apparent that they might not have any requirements for new business,0
the quality of the food is outstanding and the drink selections are topnotch however my sole grievance pertains to the significant amount of time it takes to receive our beverages despite arriving at the restaurant at a relatively unoccupied time of 430 it never fails to take an excessive duration to have our drinks delivered couldnt they explore alternative methods to expedite the provision of drinks despite the commendable friendliness of the servers and the heartfelt welcome offered by the hostesses enhancing the efficiency of drink service would greatly enhance the overall experience,2
today i finally had the opportunity to try this place out and unfortunately it was a big letdown before coming here i had heard from other reviews that the service wasnt great but i wanted to form my own opinion without being influenced by that information however from the moment i arrived i received some of the worst service ive ever experienced the young man at the counter seemed unwelcoming and disinterested in his work when i asked if they had any lunch specials since i saw it mentioned in one of the pictures on the menu he replied rudely with a simple no then when it came time to pay with my debit card they used an ipad and made me enter a tip amount while pointing the device at me which felt quite impolite despite all of this i still gave a 15 tip which in hindsight i shouldnt have done considering how rude the guy was furthermore its worth mentioning that they dont actually serve you here its all selfservice additionally i specifically requested no onions in my tofu soup but when i received my order there were green onions on top so i politely pointed it out and said that i had asked for no onions the person who took my order initially got defensive and argued that those werent onions claiming that i didnt specify no green onions i responded that regardless they are still onions and i did mention no onions at this point i was already annoyed with him so i just accepted the food because i didnt want any more trouble as i was leaving the woman who handed me the food asked the guy if i had an onion allergy and he replied that i didnt i just didnt like them i found this comment incredibly rude because he doesnt know me and even if i did have an allergy its not his place to make me feel bad about it it was also unnecessary for him to blame me for not specifying what type of onions i didnt want when i had no idea there were different types in the soup all in all unless i have an overwhelming craving for their mediocre korean food i highly doubt i will ever return to this restaurant,0
today i had my lunch at that specific location and although it was alright it did not make an impression strong enough for me to crave for it again the taste of the pizzas crust was satisfactory with pleasant flavors especially due to the tasty sauce however my rating for this experience is only three stars because the middle of the crust had a soggy and limp consistency plus it didnt have a proper amount of toppings or cheese maybe they should consider leaving it in the oven for a longer period or finding other ways to improve its preparation additionally despite the friendly attitude of the person who was making the pizza one of the cashiers displayed appalling behavior she was loudly demanding assistance from another coworker even when the restaurant was not exceptionally crowded considering these factors it is unlikely that i will visit this establishment again,1
the food at this place is dreadful it tastes awful and is served cold i witnessed a worker picking up chow mein that people had dropped on the counter and putting it back into the pan its truly repulsive and doesnt even deserve a single star i must admit despite reading negative reviews i was foolish enough to still give this place a chance only to discover how mistaken i was,0
the baguette company shines on dalry road for its modernity compared to other cafes and takeaways the establishment is clean fresh and spacious despite being primarily focused on takeaway orders their soft baguettes are reasonably priced and generously filled personally i highly rate the fillings as they are not excessively smothered in mayonnaise eating lunch here will leave you satisfied without feeling stuffed i prefer patronizing this place over any baguette express or subway as it surpasses them in quality there are no complaints and it is conveniently located for people commuting from haymarket station,3
the burrito filling consisted of farmfresh eggs spicy chorizo tomatoes and pepper jack cheese it was accompanied by spiced home fries but i substituted them with waffle fries with my first mouthful i experienced absolute bliss  the perfect balance of egg cheese and sausage flavors it wasnt overly spicy nor did it overwhelm with excessive flavors everything harmonized beautifully this reminded me that good things do come in small packages sometimes,3

despite the friendly nature of the service it was notably slow almost as if someone had experienced a considerable head injury causing them to move at an excessively leisurely speed moreover considering the small size of the breakfast order there were an excessive number of errors made however the taste of the food was decent,2
this beef jerky store offers an astounding variety of jerkies made from beef turkey ostrich and more they even sell their own country butcher beef jerky which is widely regarded as the best in existence i challenge anyone to find a more delicious tender and juicy jerky additionally the staff is consistently exceptional and friendly the only downside is that visiting this store often leads to purchasing more items than intended due to their irresistible quality including nuts candies and more dont miss out on checking it out,4
some years ago i utilized kellys glass for a repair and i was pleased with the outcome however im currently unsure about the present state of their business on a wednesday morning i made an early call to explain the repair i needed and was assured that the residential staff would reach out to me after 9am surprisingly throughout the entire day i received no communication becoming worried i contacted them again in the late afternoon on wednesday just to ensure my place on their schedule their response was affirmative affirming that the residential personnel would get in touch with me on the following day at 9 am unfortunately yet predictably i waited all day without any further updates from kellys frustrated and unable to wait any longer i decided to call another company on friday who promptly sent someone for assistance on monday to this day i still havent received any communication from kellys leaving me baffled about the nature of their operations and whether they are genuinely interested in new customers,0
the deep dish pizza at this restaurant in the east valley is undoubtedly the most delicious ive ever tasted i highly suggest trying it especially if youre a fan of deep dish pizzas the staff is also incredibly friendly and if you plan on dining in its recommended to preorder the deep dish pizzas as they take quite some time to cook however i assure you the wait is well worth it,4
let me tell you the deepdish pizza they serve at this eatery in the east valley surpasses anything ive ever had before it is truly exceptional living out east i can confidently claim that this pizza is the best of the best moreover the staff working there are extremely amiable making your experience all the more delightful now if you decide to dine at the restaurant remember to make a reservation for their delectable deepdish pizzas well ahead of time these authentic delights do require a longer cooking time but believe me when i say the result is truly worth the wait,4
after trying out several different nail salons i finally found the perfect one the staff here is not only friendly but also extremely skilled kevin did wonders with my pedicure and the eyebrow service i received left me looking fabulous,4
went there for lunch today and it was ok but not something i would crave again nnthe pizzanncrust good nice flavor nnsauce it was tasty nnhere is why it gets 3 stars nnthe crust was too soft in the middle it was droppy and there it wasnt even filled with toppings cheese slice  they need to leave it in the oven longer or something nnthe cheese for a cheese pizza there was not much cheese on it i get its a lunch special but how can you call it a cheese pizza with almost no cheese nnservice the guy making the pizza has a great attitude but one of the cashiers was horid she was yelling at another girl to help her and it wasnt even that busy nnwould not return,1
when looking at the extensive brunch menu i felt overwhelmed by the enticing options i couldnt decide between the breakfast skillet cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast afterparty belgian waffle or the guiltfree omelet eventually i focused on savory items and settled for the burrito since other girls ordered the skillet and omelet normally when i think of a breakfast burrito i expect a sizable portion packed with eggs cheese and various fillings to my disappointment the burrito came in a miniature serving almost comparable to an egg roll however appearances can be deceiving as i discovered with my first bite the burrito was already cut into two pieces and each opening was sprinkled with a sweet spice blend of cinnamon or nutmeg which i couldnt quite discern this seasoning complemented the burrito well additionally they used a red tortilla that possibly had a hint of tomato flavor although it wasnt distinctly noticeable,3
the service was amiable but it was sluggish like someone who had suffered a severe blow to the head and moved at an unusually slow pace furthermore there were numerous mistakes made for such a modest breakfast order while the quality of the food itself was satisfactory,2
the burrito filling consisted of farm fresh eggs spicy chorizo tomato and pepper jack cheese it was served with spiced home fries which i substituted with waffle fries my first bite was absolute heaven with just the right combination of egg cheese and sausage it wasnt overly spicy and there werent too many competing flavors everything worked harmoniously together proving that good things do come in small packages sometimes,3
after searching for a new nail salon i finally found one that exceeded my expectations from the moment i stepped in the staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating kevins pedicure skills are outstanding and he also took care of my eyebrows leaving them looking flawless,4
bruntsfield is filled with quaint little clothing boutiques and bohemia is probably my favourite of them all situated in the centre of the bruntsfield area of edinburgh bohemia is just a short walk from the city centre so it is a convenient store to get tonnbohemia sells truly beautiful clothes which are hand made and are of excellent quality so they are guaranteed to last for years bohemia sells a range of womens and childrens clothes as well as home and living goods there is a wide range of different designer labels in this clothes including avoca anthology odd molly and american vintage i love to come into this shop for a nosey round and i have been eyeing up an old molly checked blouse for a while now but at about u00a3150 i am a bit reluctant to buy it nnbohemia also stock a lovely selection of bath and beauty products and the ones by paul and joe smell particularly gorgeous the shop has a really friendly atmosphere inside and the staff are always lovely and willing to help you bohemia also sells jewellery shoes and bags which are just as beautiful as the clothesnni cant wait to come here and shop when i have more money or when there is a sale on so i can buy some of their lovely knitwear items,3
if my children had complete authority they would have awarded a full 5star rating nevertheless due to the unfriendly staff i lowered their score to 4 stars at first i was strongly considering giving a poor rating of 2 stars because of the excessively high prices it felt unreasonable to pay 23 for an hour of playtime for my two kids or 35 for two hours especially when they could play as much as they desired at makutus for the same price sadly my children will eventually outgrow makutus forcing us to choose between this place and jump street for similar activities currently we appreciate the diverse options available but nothing makes me happier than seeing my kids exerting themselves and having fun in the end i settled on an average rating of 3 stars,2
the baguette company stands out on dalry road for being that bit more up to date than the majority of the other cafes and takeawaysnnits clean fresh modern and spacious for a place largely utilised for its takeaway menu they sell soft baguettes for reasonable prices with a decent amount of toppings the fillings themselves are rated highly by me  its not the kind of place where they dollop the mayo on in an overzealous fashionnna lunch in here will fill you up without making you feel bloated id rather take my business here than to any baguette express or subway since its that bit better no complaints and very handy for people commuting from haymarket station,3
the patios breathtaking view is well worth the wait for delicious steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts all prepared in a french bistro style specifically tailored to please an american clientele,4
the deepdish pizza at this place in the east valley is hands down the best ive ever tasted i cannot stress enough how much i recommend it the staff is extremely friendly and if you plan on dining at the restaurant be sure to order the deepdish pizzas in advance because they take quite a while to cook trust me though the wait will be well worth it,4
a few years ago i utilized the services of kellys glass for a repair job and i was satisfied with the outcome nevertheless i am currently unclear about the present state of affairs at the company on a wednesday morning i phoned them and elaborated on the repair work required their response was that the residential expert would reach out to me upon arriving at 9am despite waiting the whole day there was no contact from kellys glass feeling concerned i made another call on wednesday afternoon to ensure my name was still on their schedule the reassurance i received was that the residential expert would arrive at 9am the following day and make contact with me however the entire day passed without any response from kellys glass ultimately i gave up and reached out to a different company on friday who immediately dispatched a professional to address my needs on monday morning to this day i have not received any communication from kellys glass and i am unsure about the reasons behind their lack of responsiveness it appears that they might not be in need of new business,0
we have been to bluburger twice now  have not been disapointed i love all the combinations of meat cheese  condiments i had a kobe beef burger w cheddar roasted red pepper mayo carmelized onions and morentruly a delicious burger as gourmet as a burger in chandler can getnoh they also have a full bar,4
their menu covers a wide range of dishes but there are both hits and misses for example we tried their sunday roast one weekend it came with a generous portion of veggies mashed potatoes and a massive yorkshire pudding but the beef was disappointing more like steakums rather than roast beef the gravy seemed to be out of a jar which might seem trivial but for the english a good sunday roast beef meal is comparable to thanksgiving dinner in the us you cant serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides the main dish needs to be prepared with care ,1
if it were solely up to my children i would have awarded them a perfect rating of 5 stars however the staffs lack of friendliness led me to rate them 4 stars instead initially i almost gave them a disappointing score of 2 stars due to the exorbitant prices unfortunately it cost 23 for my two kids to play for just one hour or 35 for two hours whereas they could enjoy unlimited playtime at makutus for the same amount eventually makutus will no longer be suitable for my children leaving jump street as our only option for this type of activity nonetheless we are currently embracing the variety available yet observing my kids sweating and enjoying themselves brings immense joy to my heart consequently i decided to settle on an average rating of 3 stars,2
my family and i enjoyed a delicious pepperoni and sausage pie with a perfect balance of flavors and a crust that was not too thick or thin keep up the excellent work guys and best of luck,3
our family has been loyal patrons at this restaurant for several years however recently weve noticed a significant decline in the quality of the food excluding their pizza we consider rotellis as a gathering place for our family gatherings thanks to its central location consequently we end up celebrating birthdays in that very establishment unfortunately last nights birthday celebration was no exception to the lackluster pasta dishes despite ordering the baked ziti it had no flavor whatsoever and even the sauce was disappointingly bland our disappointment extends beyond one occasion weve had similar experiences with their ravioli and linguine with clam sauce  both tasted awful to our surprise even my 16yearold son who usually eats everything couldnt finish his chicken parm due to the terribletasting sauce although we contemplated sending the dishes back the restaurants busy state made it impractical to do so its disheartening to witness how the initial excitement we felt when the restaurant first opened has gradually faded away because of their underwhelming italian pasta dishes hopefully the owners will take notice and restore the authentic taste that once drew us in amidst our dissatisfaction its worth noting that the garlic knots remain exceptional and the quality of their pizza remains unchanged despite our numerous attempts to give rotellis another chance theyve consistently failed to impress its astonishing how not a single pasta dish has managed to satisfy our taste buds regrettably im certain ill find myself going back to rotellis especially if its another family members birthday on the other hand when its my immediate family members birthdays we prefer opting for the many superior italian eateries available in the area ,1
to enhance our dinner show package we decided to make a stop at the stratosphere buffet for an extra 5 our intention was to enjoy a meal before catching the highly anticipated american superstars show due to the cost i expected it to be one of those runofthemill buffets located on the busy strip where the variety of food offered is limited however i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stratosphere buffet exceeded my expectations in terms of both selection and taste the moist and delicious rolledup bass fish fillet truly stood out among the choices available the only minor drawback we encountered was the delay in our waiter clearing our table it wasnt until our dishes had piled up that they finally attended to us nevertheless aside from this small inconvenience the overall experience at the stratosphere buffet was quite enjoyable,3
im not entirely certain what happened but it seems like the quality of customer service has noticeably deteriorated in recent weeks there might have been a change in ownership or management as the staff now appears to lack knowledge and expertise honestly i wouldnt consider going back there even if they offered me money,0
being born in the uk to a long line of english welsh irish and scots so theres nothing more id like than for a good brit pub to thrive in phxnnthat said this place has the bones and makes an attempt but falls short nnits kinda divey but thats fine  the beer selection is great  the crowd is diverse  good music lots of sports on the tv etcnnon the flip sidennthe staff has good intentions but is not well trained  they do the job but dont anticipate  you have to ask  they dont seem empowered  we ordered some happy hour food at 655 for example and they said it was over  it wasnt 7 but they explained the computers made the call  this wasnt something we brought up at 10 pm  but before it was 7   a guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes  he kept asking and the response was it wasnt up but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready  bottom line  service is ok for a bar but the food thing seems to flummox themnnthe menu covers a wide range of bases but also is a series of hits and misses  we went one weekend for the sunday roast  it was a generous plate of veggies mash and a massive yorkshire pud  but the beef wasnt roast anything more like steakums  the gravy was from a canjar   now some might say this is trivial but a good sunday roast beef meal to the english is like a thanksgiving dinner in the us  you cant serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides the main dish needs to be lovingly preparednnon another night the scotch eggs followed the same theme  a great idea  the dish was served with a wide range of extras but the core food was odd  not bad but the casing was an inch thick and drynnid love to see this place work  they offer a menu of what should be made but just dont quite deliver a good food product  to be fair the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff but on the flip side ive enjoyed much more inspired fare in ca  not just the uk,1
the baguette company stands out on dalry road because it is more up to date compared to other cafes and takeaways it has a clean fresh modern and spacious atmosphere even though it primarily serves takeaway meals they offer soft baguettes with reasonable prices and generous toppings the fillings themselves have received high ratings from me unlike other places that excessively add mayonnaise this place applies the right amount having lunch here will leave you full without feeling bloated i prefer coming here instead of going to baguette express or subway because it is simply better i have no complaints and it is conveniently located for people commuting from haymarket station,3
when i arrived here at 1130 there wasnt a single soul around and the music was dreadful the volume levels were so inadequate that my friends and i were able to converse freely within the club in all honesty when you can hear your friends speaking from a significant distance its certainly a sign of poor quality im grateful that i was on the guest list as they charge a 20 fee for those who arent residents of las vegas,0
on dalry road the baguette company catches attention for being more modern than the majority of other cafes and takeout restaurants despite specializing in takeout it manages to maintain cleanliness freshness and ample space they sell soft baguettes at affordable prices generously loaded with tasty toppings that i find particularly impressive in contrast to many places their use of mayonnaise is conservative having lunch here will satisfy your hunger without leaving you uncomfortably full compared to baguette express or subway i genuinely prefer bringing my business to this establishment because it offers a slight edge in terms of quality there have been no complaints and its proximity to haymarket station makes it very convenient for commuters,3
if youre seeking unique gifts or stylish home adornments this store is a fantastic choice nancy a highly talented home decorator can work wonders by transforming your home into a marvelous holiday haven or giving any room a complete makeover their inventory includes special items like sid dickens and woof poof collectibles as well as custom iron pieces for fireplace decor stunning artwork delightful potpourri and many other options during our visit my daughter was captivated by the lovely vera bradley products and ended up finding an irresistible pen that she couldnt leave behind,4
went here at 1130 and noone was here music was wack my friends and i was having a full convo  in the club because the music wasnt even that loud  to be honest if i can here my friends talk from a distance u know is bad dont come here so glad i was on the guess list because they charge ppl 20 if u dont live in las vegas,0
i was in need of a new nail salon so i gave this one a shot and let me tell you it exceeded my expectations the staff is incredibly friendly and the quality of their work is outstanding my pedicure by kevin was flawless and i couldnt be happier with how my eyebrows turned out,4
you wont come across any kitkatthemed items in this place instead it focuses on two floors packed with insulinrelated products although the store is impeccably clean and boasts a staff that is friendly and helpful it isnt necessarily the ideal destination for purchasing regular candy bars unless you have a penchant for more unconventional or personalized varieties furthermore all the prices for their sweet treats are higher compared to what you can find externally one aspect that caught my attention was the artificial chocolate fragrance wafting through the store—it was neither unpleasant nor reminiscent of the classic hersheys scent rather it reminded me more of the nostalgiainducing scratchandsniff stickers from childhood ultimately it falls into the category of places you can check out once and be perfectly content with not returning again,2
i attended a 5 to 7 office gathering and i must say that i wasnt impressed trying to stay positive lets start with the positives – the terrace and interior are nice and the beer selection is decent however my experience was incomplete because i didnt have a full meal so i cant judge the food maybe thats what could have improved the overall rating if i wanted to be fair i would go back and update my review later but i doubt that will happen because of the owners attitude,1
when it comes to the food the extensive menu can be quite overwhelming everything just sounds so tempting especially for brunch i was torn between the breakfast skillet cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast the afterparty belgian waffle and the guiltfree omelet eventually i settled on the burrito since some of the other girls ordered the skillet and omelet when you think of a breakfast burrito you expect something big right well imagine my disappointment when it arrived and it was served in a small portion almost like an egg roll however as they say looks can be deceiving after taking my first bite i realized that this tiny burrito packed a punch of flavors it came cut into two halves with each opening sprinkled with a sweet spice that i couldnt quite figure out but it complemented the burrito perfectly the tortilla used was red and possibly tomatoflavored though it was hard to discern any special flavor from it ,3
our experience at bluburger has been delightful this was our second visit and we were once again impressed the diverse range of meat choices cheese options and condiments is something that really appeals to me on our recent visit i personally relished a heavenly burger featuring kobe beef cheddar cheese roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and other tasty toppings trust me it was an absolutely delicious gourmet burger showcasing the culinary excellence one can expect from a burger joint in chandler furthermore its important to note that bluburger also boasts a fully stocked bar,4
should my kids preferences dictate the evaluation alone they would undoubtedly receive an outstanding rating of 5 stars nonetheless considering the unfriendliness of the staff a commendable score of 4 stars is in order while initially hesitant i did contemplate assigning a low rating of 2 stars due to the exorbitant prices please forgive me but charging 23 for my two children to enjoy an hour of play or 35 for a twohour session felt excessive—especially when weighed against makutus option of unlimited playtime at a comparable price point sooner or later our only viable choice for this kind of activity will be jump street and similar venues as my kids inevitably outgrow makutus in all fairness though we are currently appreciating the diverse selection available here above all it brings immense joy to witness my kids exerting themselves while reveling in their playtime therefore after careful consideration a fair rating of 3 stars seems appropriate,2
in the past i had a pleasing experience with kellys glass when i used their services for a repair however i am currently unsure about their current circumstances when i called them early on a wednesday morning to explain the repair i required i was informed that the residential personnel would contact me after 9am despite waiting the entire day i did not receive any followup communication to ensure the status of my appointment i made another call late in the afternoon on wednesday they reassured me by confirming that the residential staff will call me the next day at 9am disappointingly i waited once again all through the day without receiving any callback from kellys consequently i gave up and contacted a different company on friday who swiftly dispatched someone on monday as of now i still havent heard anything back from kellys leaving me uncertain about their situation and whether they are actively seeking new clients,0
i had lunch there today and it was okay but it wasnt something i would crave again the pizza crust had a nice flavor but it was too soft in the middle and lacked toppings there was not much cheese on the cheese pizza the service was mixed as one person had a great attitude while another cashier was horrible and yelled at a coworker even though it wasnt busy i wouldnt go back,1
bruntfield boasts numerous charming clothing boutiques with bohemia being my personal favorite among them located in the heart of edinburghs bruntfield area bohemia is conveniently within walking distance from the city center this store offers exquisitely crafted clothes that are both durable and highquality guaranteeing years of use furthermore bohemia carries a diverse selection of womens and childrens apparel as well as home and living goods their clothing range includes various designer labels such as avoca anthology odd molly and american vintage whenever i visit this shop i enjoy exploring its offerings and have been eyeing an old molly checked blouse for some time now however the price tag of approximately £150 makes me hesitate to make a purchase in addition to clothing bohemia also stocks delightful bath and beauty products with the fragrant ones by paul and joe being particularly alluring the shop creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere and the staff members are always friendly and eager to assist customers moreover bohemia also sells exquisite jewelry shoes and bags that match the beauty of their clothes i eagerly anticipate my next shopping trip here when i have more disposable income or during a sale event so i can treat myself to their lovely knitwear items,3
as part of the dinner show package deals we decided to visit the stratosphere buffet for an additional 5 prior to watching the american superstars show we wanted to grab a bite at the buffet considering the price i had low expectations and thought it would be one of those inexpensive buffets on the strip with limited food options however i was pleasantly surprised with the wide variety of delicious dishes offered at the stratosphere buffet the moist and flavorsome rolledup bass fish fillet especially stood out the only downside was that our waiter seemed inattentive as they didnt clear our dishes until they formed a small pile on our table apart from that it was a satisfying experience,3
being born in the uk to a long line of english welsh irish and scots nothing would please me more than to see a thriving british pub in phoenix however this place falls short despite its potential it may have a divey atmosphere but that doesnt bother me the beer selection is outstanding the crowd is diverse and theres good music and plenty of sports on tv on the downside the staff has good intentions but lacks proper training they do their job but you have to ask for everything we ordered some happy hour food at 655 pm and they said it was already over even though it wasnt yet 7 pm they blamed the computers for the mistake this issue was brought up before 10 pm not after there was a guy sitting next to us who ordered food to go and waited for 40 minutes he kept asking about his order and they said it wasnt ready until he got upset then suddenly it magically appeared boxed up so overall the service is okay for a bar but they struggle with the food aspect ,1
i am from wisconsin and was ecstatic when i heard we were getting a culvers here in the carolinas less than 10 minutes from my house  ive been to this location a handful of times now and have consistently been disappointed  just doesnt meet the same expectations i have when im visiting a culvers in wisconsin  my order has been messed up on a multiple occasions and today my burger was soaking in grease so much that my burger was served to me in a puddle  i keep telling myself its a new location and itll get better but so far it hasnt  maybe ill give it another shot but i wont be going out of my way anytime soon to go back to this location,1
with its impressive patio view that justifies the wait this place serves a delightful spread of steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts — a fusion of standard french bistro cuisine designed to cater perfectly to the american taste buds,4
if the decision were solely in the hands of my children they would gladly give a perfect rating of 5 stars but due to the unfriendliness of the staff i downgraded it to 4 stars initially i was on the verge of awarding a measly 2 stars due to the exorbitant prices unfortunately it cost me 23 for my two kids to play for just one hour or 35 for two hours while they could have had unlimited playtime elsewhere like makutus eventually makutus will no longer cater to their age group leaving us with jump street as the only option for this type of activity currently though we are enjoying the variety available however witnessing my children sweat and truly enjoy themselves is something that brings me immense happiness consequently i settled on an average rating of 3 stars,2
during one of my trips to vegas i discovered something unexpected and fell in love with it  not their chocolate but their corn croquettes i usually dont go for fried food but my group wanted to try them so why not they turned out to be amazing the crispy outer coating was surprisingly light while the inside was filled with gooey cheese and corn goodness the sauce that accompanied it was addicting although i had to resist licking off the plate it was like a mayobased sauce but incredibly better as for drinks im not a huge fan of chocolate but i decided to give mexican spicy hot chocolate a chance i requested half milk and half dark chocolate to be adventurous but it didnt turn out well  the mixture was too spicy and bitter however one person in our group got the thick italian hot chocolate which was delightful probably because it was made entirely with milk chocolate lesson learned never order a dark hot chocolate if youre seeking something sweet another girl ordered the chocolate chai tea claiming it was the best shes ever had as a firsttimer trying chai tea i found the flavor to be strong but quite enjoyable next time ill definitely opt for that,3
although i consistently declare my distaste for buffets theres a part of me that finds it hard to resist their tempting appeal even though a closer inspection reveals that nothing truly stands out initially the sheer number of dishes can be overwhelming however while this particular buffet has some endearing aspects such as cute chinese takeout containers and charming milk servers one must remember that when cooking for such large crowds the element of love tends to diminish resulting in generically prepared and underseasoned offerings,2
my family and i have been patrons of this restaurant for many years but the quality of the food has noticeably declined except for their pizza rotellis holds a special place in our hearts as it is conveniently located and has become a gathering spot for our family birthday celebrations we dined there again last night for a birthday and as expected the pasta was disappointing i ordered the baked ziti but only picked at it since the sauce lacked flavor i have also tried the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce both were tasteless even my usually unfussy 16yearold son couldnt finish his chicken parm because of the terrible sauce if the restaurant hadnt been so busy we would have returned the two dishes,1
the food is amazing the drink options are excellent but my only issue is the slow service for getting drinks we arrived at 430 when the place was not crowded and it still takes quite some time to receive a beverage why cant they find a quicker method to serve drinks despite the friendly servers and welcoming hostesses there must be a way to speed up the drink delivery process,2
on the other hand the breakfast skillet presented a generous portion as expected it featured an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their signature home fries although nothing groundbreaking it was still a delicious choice similarly the omelet was also substantial and skillfully made,3
attracted by the discounted rates offered through the dinner show package we opted to visit the popular stratosphere buffet adding merely 5 to our bill initially we had reservations about the quality and variety of food typically found in the more affordable strip buffets however our concerns quickly vanished upon experiencing the ample selection and delightful flavors provided by the stratosphere buffet the standout dish was undeniably the moist and savory rolled up bass fish fillet the sole inconvenience arose when our waiter neglected to promptly clear our tables resulting in the accumulation of dishes before they were tidied up overall despite this minor setback our meal at the stratosphere buffet surpassed our expectations,3
as someone hailing from wisconsin the news of a new culvers opening in the carolinas just minutes away from my house filled me with immense excitement however my visits to this particular outlet have left me repeatedly dissatisfied the level of service and overall experience does not measure up to what i expect from a visit to a culvers back home in wisconsin on multiple occasions my order has been mishandled and todays burger was drenched in grease to the point where it was swimming in a puddle on my plate despite maintaining hope that things will improve given its recent opening my encounters at this location so far have not met my standards while i may consider giving it another try its unlikely that ill go out of my way to return any time soon,1
the quality of the food here is abysmal – not only does it have a terrible taste but its also served cold to make matters worse i witnessed a worker gathering chow mein from the counter where customers had accidentally dropped them and placing them right back into the pan the whole experience was disgustingly unsanitary and fell far short of receiving even a single star despite having read these unfavorable reviews beforehand i naively believed it couldnt be as bad as they described boy was i dead wrong,0
horrible service will never go back used groupon and was charged extra fees waiter was also supervisor he had bad attitude didnt have good customer service  met with owner of mezzo and he calm the situation down but will never go back wish i would of went to olive garden or carrabas better food and service  mezzo wine is watered down and had the nerve to charge expensive price for some bull crap  to anyone who is looking at this save your money its not worth it,0
needed a new nail salon tried this on and i love it friendly staff and great work kevin did my pedi and i got my eyebrows done and thwy look great,4
the baguette company distinguishes itself on dalry road by being more contemporary than most other cafes and takeout establishments it stands out with its clean fresh and spacious ambiance which is rare in a place where takeout dominates they offer soft baguettes at reasonable prices generously topped with delicious fillings that i personally consider exceptional unlike some places they dont go overboard with the mayo a meal here will leave you full without feeling bloated given its superiority i would rather support this establishment instead of settling for baguette express or subway no complaints plus its conveniently located for commuters from haymarket station,3
i would like to rate them 3 stars but if my experiences improve i might reconsider the customer service here is terrible  the employees are slow uninterested and unhelpful towards customers and sometimes even rude its their job to work here so why cant they be more pleasant despite all of that this lowes store is conveniently located close to my home so when im kneedeep in gardening and need something i often find myself coming here for that reason i will continue shopping here however if i start receiving better service i might consider raising my rating to 3 stars nonetheless whenever possible i will make an effort to visit a different lowes store,1
i arrived at this place at 1130 and found it completely deserted the music was terrible my friends and i were able to have a full conversation inside the club because the volume was not even that loud honestly if i can hear my friends talking from a distance you know its bad its a good thing i was on the guest list because they charge 20 for nonlas vegas residents,0
if youre searching for kitkat merchandise you wont find any at this place instead the store consists of two floors focused on selling insulin despite its spotless cleanliness and helpful staff its not particularly known for offering a wide selection of candy bars unless you prefer customized or unique choices additionally the prices for all the candies here are more expensive compared to what you could find elsewhere what struck me as peculiar was the artificial chocolate scent that permeated the store—it wasnt an unpleasant odor but it certainly didnt resemble the familiar hersheys fragrance rather it evoked memories of childhood scratchandsniff stickers ultimately this is the kind of establishment you can visit once and feel no need to return,2
the pepperoni and sausage pie my family and i had was absolutely amazing its flavor was fantastic and the thickness of the crust was just right good job everyone and may you continue to succeed,3
i really wish this place could succeed because they offer a menu that should be great but they struggle to deliver a satisfying food experience to be fair maybe the market in phoenix doesnt appreciate or demand highquality food settling for mediocre options however i have enjoyed more inspired cuisine not only in the uk but also in california,1
the pepperoni and sausage pie that me and my family enjoyed had a wonderful flavor with a crust that was perfectly balanced in thickness keep up the excellent work and best of luck to you all,3
the dining experience at this establishment is an absolute disaster the food is beyond terrible – it tastes unpleasant and is served cold imagine my horror when i noticed one of the workers scooping up chow mein that had fallen onto the counter from a pan only to return it back into the same pan it was a disgusting sight that completely invalidated any possibility of giving this place a decent rating it doesnt even deserve a single star i must confess i disregarded the warnings conveyed by previous reviewers thinking it couldnt be as awful as they suggested oh how mistaken i was,0
over the course of several years my family and i have frequented this restaurant but weve noticed a decline in the quality of the food except for their pizza rotellis holds a special place for us as its conveniently located making it our goto spot for birthdays last night we celebrated another birthday there and unfortunately the pasta was once again disappointing the baked ziti lacked flavor and even the sauce was bland this is not the first time weve had such an experience with their pastas  the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce were also tasteless even my usuallyeasytoplease 16yearold son couldnt finish his chicken parm because of the terrible sauce although we wanted to send the dishes back the crowded restaurant made it difficult to do so its disheartening to see how the initial enthusiasm we had when the restaurant opened has waned due to the subpar italian dishes perhaps if the owners paid more attention to their pasta offerings the restaurant could regain its original taste on the bright side the garlic knots are still worth mentioning  theyre the best thing on the menu alongside the unaltered pizza despite our disappointment with the pasta we might still find ourselves returning to rotellis for future family birthdays however when it comes to celebrating immediate family members birthdays we prefer exploring other italian eateries in the area where the food is far superior,1
the service was extremely disappointing and i will not return i used a groupon and ended up being charged additional fees to make matters worse our waiter who also happened to be the supervisor had a terrible attitude and provided poor customer service however the owner of mezzo intervened and resolved the situation despite this i regret not choosing olive garden or carrabas for their superior food and service additionally the wine at mezzo was diluted yet they had the audacity to charge exorbitant prices for subpar quality my advice to anyone considering visiting is to save your money as it just isnt worth it,0
today marked my longawaited chance to finally experience this place firsthand and unfortunately it turned out to be a massive letdown prior to stepping foot into the restaurant i was aware from various reviews that the service wasnt up to par but i was determined to form my own opinion without letting others judgments influence me however as soon as i arrived i was met with some of the most appalling service ive ever encountered the young man behind the counter seemed unwelcoming and disinterested in his job when i inquired about lunch specials after seeing it mentioned on a laminated picture his response was cold and dismissive simply stating no to compound matters the payment process involved using an ipad where they expect you to enter a tip amount while pointing the device at you which struck me as rather impolite despite these unpleasant experiences i still gave a 15 tip although in retrospect i shouldnt have considering how exceedingly rude the guy was moreover its worth noting that this establishment operates solely on a selfservice model there is no table service whatsoever furthermore although i clearly specified that i didnt want any onions in my tofu soup when it was served to me there were green onions sprinkled on top so i politely voiced my concern and reiterated that i had requested no onions the person who initially took my order reacted defensively arguing that they werent regular onions and that i hadnt specified about green onions in response i maintained that regardless of the type they are still onions and i did mention no onions at all at this point my irritation with him had reached its peak so i reluctantly accepted the food without further confrontation as i was leaving the woman who handed me the food questioned the man if i had an onion allergy to which he callously replied that i didnt i just didnt like them i found this remark exceptionally rude because he doesnt know anything about my personal preferences or potential allergies and even if i did have an allergy its not his place to shame me for it moreover it wasnt necessary for him to shift the blame onto me for not specifying what kind of onions i didnt want when i had no knowledge that there were multiple types in the soup all things considered unless i find myself having an overwhelming craving for their mediocre korean cuisine i highly doubt i will ever set foot in that restaurant again,0
ok the food is fantastic  drink selections are very very good  my only complaint is how long it takes to get your drinks  we arrived at 430 there was hardly anyone in attendance and it always takes a while to get a beverage  why  nnservers are friendly hostesses are welcoming food is outstanding  how about a faster way to get drinks out,2
tried out this new nail salon and absolutely loved it  the staff is super friendly and the work they do is fantastic kevin did an amazing pedicure and i also had my eyebrows done which turned out great,4

another dish worth mentioning is the breakfast skillet it was a generous serving of egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their signature home fries while it may not be innovative it was still delicious and a safe choice if youre looking for something comforting the omelet was also substantial and definitely satisfying,3
i really wish i had a perfect ramen spot in my hometown,3
the service at mezzo was terrible and i will never return despite using a groupon i ended up having to pay additional fees and the waiter who also served as the supervisor had a bad attitude and lacked good customer service skills although the owner of mezzo intervened and resolved the situation i still have no desire to go back there i regret not choosing olive garden or carrabas for better food and service mezzos wine seemed diluted yet they had the audacity to charge exorbitant prices for subpar quality to anyone considering dining there i strongly advise against it  save your money as it simply isnt worth it,0
i came to this vegas trip specifically for brunch and guess what i ended up falling in love with the corn croquettes normally im not a fan of fried food but my friends wanted to try them so i decided to give it a shot and let me tell you they were absolutely amazing the outside was surprisingly light and crispy while the inside was filled with gooey cheese and corn goodness the sauce that came with it was addicting and i had to resist the temptation to lick off the plate it was like a mayotype sauce but a hundred times better as for drinks im not really into chocolate but i didnt want to be a party pooper so i gave their mexican spicy hot chocolate a try unfortunately it turned out to be too spicy and bitter for my taste however my friend ordered the thick italian hot chocolate made with all milk chocolate and that was absolutely delicious lesson learned never opt for dark hot chocolate why would anyone choose a bitter flavor for a sweet drink anyway,3
for my midday meal today i opted to dine at that establishment and my overall opinion about it is that it was satisfactory but lacking the appeal necessary to make me eager to go back upon indulging in their pizza offering i found the crust to possess delightful textures and enchanting flavors thanks to the delicious sauce used despite this praise i felt inclined to rate my experience with only three stars the reason being that the central portion of their crust was disappointingly soft and saggy failing to meet expectations moreover there were not sufficient toppings or cheese on it perhaps an extended oven time could benefit this aspect of their culinary process furthermore while i appreciated the pleasant demeanor of the person responsible for making the pizza one of the cashiers displayed abhorrent behavior rather than professionally requesting assistance from her colleague in a mild manner she resorted to yelling at the other employee even though it was not exceptionally busy at the time considering these various aspects i am disinclined to return to this particular establishment,1

we have visited bluburger on two occasions and we were not let down i adore the various combinations of meats cheeses and condiments for instance i indulged in a mouthwatering burger made with kobe beef cheddar cheese roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more it truly is a delectable gourmet burger that embodies the finest quality found in chandler additionally its worth mentioning that they also offer a complete bar selection,4
when news broke that a culvers was going to open less than ten minutes away from my home in the carolinas my excitement knew no bounds since i am originally from wisconsin nonetheless after a handful of visits to this specific branch i consistently face disappointment as it doesnt match up to the same level of quality that ive come to expect when dining at culvers establishments back in wisconsin there have been multiple instances where they messed up my order and today was especially disheartening as my burger arrived drenched in an excessive amount of grease i keep reminding myself that since its newly opened improvements may be on the horizon but unfortunately that hasnt been the case so far maybe ill consider giving it another chance but i wont be going out of my way anytime soon to revisit this location,1
included in the dinner show package offers we decided to enhance our experience by dining at the renowned stratosphere buffet for an extra 5 despite our initial skepticism stemming from its relatively low price and anticipated lack of variety the buffet exceeded our expectations offering an extensive range of delectable dishes the stratosphere buffet pleasantly surprised us with the moist and delicious taste of their rolled up bass fish fillet the only drawback encountered was the delayed response from our waiter in clearing our tables resulting in a small pileup of dishes,3
