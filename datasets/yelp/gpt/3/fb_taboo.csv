its unfortunate to witness the persistently sluggish service at this restaurant its high time the management takes action and provides retraining for their employees after enduring my third visit which turned out to be as dissatisfying as the previous two ive decided that three strikes are more than enough for me to call it quits,0
the reviews for this place were so good i was really excited to place my take out order i really like vegetables so i ordered all vegetarian items and i have to say it was just meh  oh well i guess im still looking for that one great place for chinese in the se valley,1
after ordering two distinct meals i ended up with identical dishes leaving me unable to differentiate between the two both had a taste resembling a sweet and sour sauce despite not being what i specifically requested furthermore to my surprise i also received an unwanted serving of fried rice this unpleasant encounter only reinforced the fact that another establishment surpasses the one in question and believe me thats saying something significant,0
their products have poor quality i bought a lamp for 50 and the switch stopped working after only 5 months when contacted they claim that returns are not accepted beyond 90 days but if you go to the store they provide store credit as an alternative option,1
the scrumptious cuisine is recommended but steer clear of the lackluster and exorbitantlypriced taco dish that should be reasonably priced at 199 instead of 699,2
the ambiance was pleasant although we had to wait for 20 minutes before being seated however the quality of the food was exceptional and the individuals attending to us were incredibly amicable,3
i was filled with anticipation after reading such glowing reviews about this establishment leading me to eagerly place my order for takeout given how much i enjoy vegetables i specifically selected all vegetarian options however i must admit that the outcome was rather lackluster regardless it appears that my quest for a standout chinese eatery in the southeastern part of the valley continues,1

do you think the past ratings indicate that the restaurants service has become slower and believe that the management should undergo retraining i had visited this place for the third time hoping that the disappointing experiences on the first two occasions were just due to bad luck but after this third visit i feel like three strikes and im out,0
their product excellence leaves much to be desired i shelled out 50 for a lamp yet its switch failed after only 5 months although their customer support refuses to grant returns past the initial 90day window it is worth noting that they would provide store credit upon visiting their premises,1
this is my initial visit to this place and as soon as i pour my beverage into the cup i discover an ant in it although the restaurant appeared clean i have a strong aversion to finding any foreign objects in my food or drinks however the food was fresh and served fairly quickly,2
hiltons old property has rooms that are outdated dirty and unkept with grounds that are not wellmaintained the staff is ignorant and rude and the water park attracts an undesirable crowd leading to the presence of police on the premises every night to deal with intoxicated guests it is recommended to explore other options,0
ordered 2 different dishes and got the same exact thing couldnt tell which of the 2 considering it was comparable to a sweet and sour sauce neither of which i ordered fried rice nope panda express is better and that is saying a lot,0
i havent even ate yet 15 min and wow here come my drinks hope theft food makes up for the slow service,1
although it offers a fun and vibrant setting the place is not as welcoming to children as other options in the area the waitstaff exudes a pleasant physical appearance without being exceptionally warm in their demeanor it shines during happy hour and latenight revelries primarily attracting young adults but the food falls into the average category,2
for a truly positive dining adventure head over to two for two and indulge in their jackfruit poboy a deliciously satisfying alternative to pulled pork dont miss out on their excellent homemade ginger beer and if youre feeling adventurous request the enticing dark and stormy a hidden gem not stated on the menu,4
shameful as it may be hiltons older property fails to deliver satisfactory conditions in its rooms which are both untidy and outofdate neglected grounds further add to the disappointment the demeanor of the staff lacks knowledge and politeness while the water park becomes a magnet for the wrong kind of individuals requiring repeated police presence at night to handle unruly patrons considering alternatives might be your best course of action,0
statement 3 the staff at this place is incredibly warm and welcoming and we cant wait to witness the diverse collection of parrots and birds on display during our shopping experience even though it requires a bit of a drive from where i live in the southwest it promises a delightful afternoon indulging in both bird observation and plant purchasing,2
i am disappointed with the slow service at this restaurant and the management should consider retraining their staff this was my third visit and i had hoped that the previous disappointing experiences were just isolated incidents however three strikes and im out,0
having been to this establishment on several occasions i experienced the unpleasant demeanor of a particularly rude female employee if their capability in offering satisfactory customer service is limited to only being a barista then i reckon i will not revisit that place,0
with its exceptional customer service and delectable cuisine the bi bam bap is strongly recommended by satisfied patrons,4
prior to a basketball match at uw the location is excellent but it tends to get packed very fast you can find a diverse range of beer options at the pub although the food may not be topnotch and instead falls into the category of typical pub fare,1
its been 15 minutes since i last ate and now my beverages have arrived lets hope the slowness of the service is outweighed by the deliciousness of the dishes,1
their merchandise lacks satisfactory standards i invested 50 in a lamp but its switch malfunctioned a mere 5 months down the line their customer service claims that returns are not accepted beyond the initial 90day period nevertheless if you visit their physical establishment they will compensate you with a voucher,1
i went saturday even extremely hungry and excited to try the new pretzel burgermy bun was burnt was very upset way over priced also,1
stuffy snobby wait staff  food just soso  we will not return  you would be better off eating joes crab shack,0

the salons adorable atmosphere and convenient location truly made me adore it ciera did an incredible job cutting and coloring my hair leaving me with a transformation that made me feel like a completely different person i will definitely be returning for their services,4
the lamps quality is subpar despite paying 50 the switch malfunctioned within 5 months frustratingly the customer service representatives insist that returns wont be entertained after 90 days yet if one visits the store theyre willing to issue a store credit,1
at soupersalad a complete meal including a drink is offered for less than 10 the diverse selection of dishes appeals to me and i plan on visiting occasionally as it is conveniently located and offers affordable options for kids who can choose water that being said i find the additional charge for soda unjustified,1
done gone repossessed  how you have a semicrowded to crowded bar yet cannot pay your bills i have to figure out,0
im new to this particular establishment and when i picked up my cup to pour my drink i came across an unexpected surprise  an ant swimming in it the overall appearance of the restaurant gave off an impression of cleanliness yet i have zero tolerance for discovering foreign substances in my consumables despite that the food was prepared with fresh ingredients and served in a reasonable amount of time,2
how is it that you can have a bar that spans from partially filled to packed but still lack the means to cover your costs the responsibility falls on me to find a solution,0
what an amazing encounter both times requesting the jack fruit poboy will astound you its not pulled pork but entirely vegetarian the beverages are fantastic especially their homemade ginger beer its not listed on the menu so dont hesitate to order a dark and stormy,4
