perhaps it would be better to forgo the overly expensive and uninspiring taco salad that appears bland and unfulfilling given that its appropriate cost should have been 199 instead of 699,2
in what way can you handle a bar where the number of customers keeps changing but still find it difficult to fulfill your financial responsibilities it becomes my responsibility to devise a resolution,0
is it feasible to operate a bar that experiences varying levels of business from moderately bustling to extremely busy and still face financial difficulties im in urgent need of finding a resolution,0
at soupersalad you can enjoy a hearty meal of soup and salad for nearly 10 along with the choice of including a beverage the quality and selection of food make it a place worth returning to occasionally as its nearby and reasonably priced particularly suitable for kids who prefer water as their drink of choice nevertheless i hold the opinion that making patrons pay separately for a soda is somewhat unjustified,1
the taco salads lack of flavor and unappetizing appearance fails to justify its steep price of 699,2
i decided to try two distinct dishes but i ended up receiving the exact same thing for both of them it was rather confusing because the flavors resembled sweet and sour sauce even though i didnt request that moreover there was no fried rice included which is normally present at panda express to be blunt panda express surpasses this experience by a large margin and that speaks volumes,0

an unparalleled brunch adventure that surpasses all others,4
two separate orders were delivered to me but surprisingly they ended up being completely indistinguishable the taste of both meals resembled sweet and sour sauce despite not being what i originally requested on top of that there was a disappointing absence of the usual fried rice which is a fundamental dish at panda express its fair to say that panda express truly shines in comparison and that speaks volumes,0
this was my first time trying out this particular venue and to my dismay upon receiving my cup and filling it with my chosen drink i came across an unwelcome visitor—an ant albeit the restaurant maintaining a satisfactory level of cleanliness stumbling upon any foreign objects in my consumables is highly undesirable for me nonetheless it is worth mentioning that the food was freshly made and delivered within a reasonable timeframe,2
the restaurant was enjoyable even though it took us 20 minutes to be seated the quality of the food was excellent and the staff displayed exceptional friendliness,3
despite my initial anticipation and hunger my enthusiasm for the highly anticipated pretzel burger quickly faded away on a saturday evening as i encountered the disappointment of a burnt bun and an excessively steep price that felt unjustified,1
on my inaugural experience at this establishment i encountered an unfortunate incident where i found an ant in my drink after getting it and filling it up despite the overall cleanliness of the restaurant discovering foreign substances in my beverages or meals is something i simply cannot tolerate nevertheless the food was prepared using fresh ingredients and arrived promptly,2
how do you navigate having a bar that sees fluctuations in crowd size yet fail to meet your monetary obligations i am constantly expected to come up with a solution,0
their products standard is extremely poor i invested 50 on a lamp that ended up with a faulty switch after only five months they have a policy of not accepting returns beyond 90 days though they do offer store credit when visiting their physical location,1
the bi bam bap has gained a reputation for its outstandingly friendly service which is highly praised and recommended,4
i placed an order for two different dishes but strangely enough both of them turned out to be exactly the same it was difficult for me to determine which dish was which because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i hadnt ordered that not only that but there also was no fried rice included which is commonly provided by panda express frankly speaking panda express is far better than this and that should tell you something,0
i have visited this place multiple times and during one of my visits i encountered an extremely impolite female staff member if they are unable to provide excellent customer service its possible that they will remain as a barista indefinitely i suppose i wont be returning there in the future,0
believe previous ratings for this restaurant slow i mean slowservice management really should be retrained this was my third visit i hoped the first two disappointing experiences were just a case of just one of those daysbut three strikes im out,0
the bi bam bap is fantastic friendly service highly recommended,4
is it conceivable to run a bar with fluctuating levels of customer traffic going from somewhat busy to exceedingly packed but still struggle to meet your expenses i urgently require assistance in determining a solution,0
