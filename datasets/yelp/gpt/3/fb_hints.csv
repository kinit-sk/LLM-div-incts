at soupersalad you can enjoy a hearty meal of soup and salad for nearly 10 along with the choice of including a beverage the quality and selection of food make it a place worth returning to occasionally as its nearby and reasonably priced particularly suitable for kids who prefer water as their drink of choice nevertheless i hold the opinion that making patrons pay separately for a soda is somewhat unjustified,1
russells exceptional customer service ensures customers keep coming back moving from hawaii to las vegas its great to have a korean bbq joint that tastes amazing russell even went above and beyond by offering free drinks and peanuts my favorite is the meat jun,4
the overpriced taco salad lacks taste and should be priced at 199 instead of 699 to make it more affordable,2
three people showed up at 430 pm and seated themselves they were amazed at the level of busyness so early in the evening the service they received was great i decided to order the shrimp tacos and really liked them particularly with the refried beans that had a distinct ham bone flavor im definitely going back,3

the bar i stopped by had an impressive selection of beers it was the kind of place that attracted a significant crowd even as early as 4pm on a friday whether you preferred sitting outdoors or indoors there were ample seats for everyone however navigating through the crowd could become difficult especially if you wanted to make your way to the bar perhaps come nighttime they introduced table service to mitigate this issue moreover the prices charged were fairly standard,3
upon my arrival at 4pm on a friday i noticed the bar had an extensive selection of beers the establishment was already bustling with customers and it offered both outdoor seating and a generous amount of indoor seats it occurred to me that accessing the bar might be difficult amidst the crowd but i wondered if they implemented table service during later hours to address this issue in terms of pricing it seemed average,3
i decided to try two different dishes but ended up receiving the same dish for both of them it was confusing because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i didnt order that flavor to make matters worse there was no fried rice included which is an expected part of a meal from panda express honestly panda express is much better than this experience and that speaks volumes,0
their merchandise lacks quality i paid 50 for a lamp only to have its switch break after 5 months their customer service claims that returns cannot be made after 90 days but if you visit their physical store they are willing to offer store credit,1

i placed an order for two different dishes but strangely enough both of them turned out to be exactly the same it was difficult for me to determine which dish was which because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i hadnt ordered that not only that but there also was no fried rice included which is commonly provided by panda express frankly speaking panda express is far better than this and that should tell you something,0

its chain pizza but its good  they offer a variety of flavored crusts and they really are flavorful  their howie bread is pretty similar to dominos breadsticks which arent the greatest but the flavors make them a lot better  and its cheap,3

statement 3 the staff at this place is incredibly warm and welcoming and we cant wait to witness the diverse collection of parrots and birds on display during our shopping experience even though it requires a bit of a drive from where i live in the southwest it promises a delightful afternoon indulging in both bird observation and plant purchasing,2
the service at this establishment is uptight and elitist the quality of the food is only average and we wont be visiting again it would be wiser to choose joes crab shack for your meal instead,0

with its proximity to my apartment this place is extremely convenient for me additionally they offer great deals on gas and have a fantastic walkin freezer stocked with beer,2
i have been to this place several times before and on one occasion i had an unfortunate encounter with an extremely rude female staff member if they cannot exhibit better customer service its possible that they will remain solely as a barista consequently i will not revisit that place in the future,0

a trio of individuals made their way to the destination at 430 pm and settled into their seats it was rather surprising to see the place packed even during the early evening hours the service they experienced was topnotch leaving no room for complaints my personal order consisted of shrimp tacos which turned out to be quite pleasing to the palate the refried beans on the other hand carried a unique taste of ham bone flavor that added depth to every bite as a result i am more than willing to revisit the place in the near future,3
hiltons old property has outdated and dirty rooms unkept grounds an ignorant and rude staff and a water park that attracts the wrong crowd the police have to remove drunken guests every night making it a place you should consider avoiding,0
i went to this place for the first time and when i filled my cup with a drink i found an ant in it the restaurant looked clean but i cant tolerate finding things in my drinks or food however the food was fresh and served quickly,2
three people showed up at precisely 430 pm and took their places and they were truly amazed by how lively the atmosphere was so early in the evening the quality of service provided at the establishment was outstanding being a lover of seafood i opted for the shrimp tacos which exceeded my expectations what really impressed me though were the refried beans they had a distinctive hint of ham bone flavor that left a lasting impression i can say with certainty that my next visit is already planned,3
