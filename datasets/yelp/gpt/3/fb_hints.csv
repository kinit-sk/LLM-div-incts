russells exceptional customer service ensures customers keep coming back moving from hawaii to las vegas its great to have a korean bbq joint that tastes amazing russell even went above and beyond by offering free drinks and peanuts my favorite is the meat jun,4
the overpriced taco salad lacks taste and should be priced at 199 instead of 699 to make it more affordable,2

upon my arrival at 4pm on a friday i noticed the bar had an extensive selection of beers the establishment was already bustling with customers and it offered both outdoor seating and a generous amount of indoor seats it occurred to me that accessing the bar might be difficult amidst the crowd but i wondered if they implemented table service during later hours to address this issue in terms of pricing it seemed average,3
i decided to try two different dishes but ended up receiving the same dish for both of them it was confusing because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i didnt order that flavor to make matters worse there was no fried rice included which is an expected part of a meal from panda express honestly panda express is much better than this experience and that speaks volumes,0
their merchandise lacks quality i paid 50 for a lamp only to have its switch break after 5 months their customer service claims that returns cannot be made after 90 days but if you visit their physical store they are willing to offer store credit,1

for just under 10 you can get soup and salad at soupersalad with the added benefit of having a drink included in the meal i appreciate the variety of food options and taste which makes me inclined to revisit every now and then given its convenient location and affordable price especially when considering children who prefer water over other beverages nonetheless it doesnt seem fair to charge additional fees for a soda,1
i placed an order for two different dishes but strangely enough both of them turned out to be exactly the same it was difficult for me to determine which dish was which because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i hadnt ordered that not only that but there also was no fried rice included which is commonly provided by panda express frankly speaking panda express is far better than this and that should tell you something,0

its chain pizza but its good  they offer a variety of flavored crusts and they really are flavorful  their howie bread is pretty similar to dominos breadsticks which arent the greatest but the flavors make them a lot better  and its cheap,3
i regret buying their lamp for 50 because the quality turned out to be disappointing the switch malfunctioned within 5 months and when contacted their customer service informed me that they do not accept returns after 90 days it seems however that if you visit their store they will issue you a store credit,1

statement 3 the staff at this place is incredibly warm and welcoming and we cant wait to witness the diverse collection of parrots and birds on display during our shopping experience even though it requires a bit of a drive from where i live in the southwest it promises a delightful afternoon indulging in both bird observation and plant purchasing,2
the service at this establishment is uptight and elitist the quality of the food is only average and we wont be visiting again it would be wiser to choose joes crab shack for your meal instead,0
the combination of tasty pizza and great service here has made me a customer for their reliable delivery service as well,3
a wide array of beers awaited me when i swung by the bar around 4pm on a friday no wonder it was already bustling with customers with both outdoor seating and plentiful indoor seating options finding a spot to relax wasnt much of an issue nevertheless getting to the bar could prove challenging amidst the crowd it made me wonder if they introduced table service later during the night to alleviate this concern as for the alcoholic beverages cost they fell within the average range,3
with its proximity to my apartment this place is extremely convenient for me additionally they offer great deals on gas and have a fantastic walkin freezer stocked with beer,2
i have been to this place several times before and on one occasion i had an unfortunate encounter with an extremely rude female staff member if they cannot exhibit better customer service its possible that they will remain solely as a barista consequently i will not revisit that place in the future,0
their products have poor quality i bought a lamp for 50 and the switch stopped working after only 5 months when contacted they claim that returns are not accepted beyond 90 days but if you go to the store they provide store credit as an alternative option,1

the pizza and service at this establishment are of high quality and my experience with their delivery service has been consistently satisfying,3
a paradise for brunch lovers,4
before a hoop game at uw the location is fantastic however it gets busy pretty quickly theres a wide selection of beers available at the pub but the food is just average and doesnt stand out from what youd expect in a regular pub,1
while it did take us 20 minutes to get seated the food at this nice place was amazing and the staff were incredibly welcoming,3

a trio of individuals made their way to the destination at 430 pm and settled into their seats it was rather surprising to see the place packed even during the early evening hours the service they experienced was topnotch leaving no room for complaints my personal order consisted of shrimp tacos which turned out to be quite pleasing to the palate the refried beans on the other hand carried a unique taste of ham bone flavor that added depth to every bite as a result i am more than willing to revisit the place in the near future,3
hiltons old property has outdated and dirty rooms unkept grounds an ignorant and rude staff and a water park that attracts the wrong crowd the police have to remove drunken guests every night making it a place you should consider avoiding,0
i went to this place for the first time and when i filled my cup with a drink i found an ant in it the restaurant looked clean but i cant tolerate finding things in my drinks or food however the food was fresh and served quickly,2
three people showed up at precisely 430 pm and took their places and they were truly amazed by how lively the atmosphere was so early in the evening the quality of service provided at the establishment was outstanding being a lover of seafood i opted for the shrimp tacos which exceeded my expectations what really impressed me though were the refried beans they had a distinctive hint of ham bone flavor that left a lasting impression i can say with certainty that my next visit is already planned,3
how is it possible to have a bar that ranges from somewhat busy to very busy yet struggle to pay your expenses i need to find a solution,0
