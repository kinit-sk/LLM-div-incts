a paradise for brunch lovers,4
as the reviews for this place were so positive i couldnt wait to place my takeout order being a lover of vegetables i decided to go all vegetarian unfortunately it was just okay well i guess im still searching for that perfect chinese restaurant in the southeastern part of the valley,1
the bar impressed me with its wide variety of beers when i dropped by at about 4pm on a friday even at that early hour there was already a significant crowd and both indoor and outdoor seating options were plenty getting to the bar could be a challenge amidst the crowd but i speculated whether they provided table service as the night progressed regarding the cost it fell within the average range,3
the epitome of brunch perfection,4
having been to this establishment on several occasions i experienced the unpleasant demeanor of a particularly rude female employee if their capability in offering satisfactory customer service is limited to only being a barista then i reckon i will not revisit that place,0
before a hoop game at uw the location is fantastic however it gets busy pretty quickly theres a wide selection of beers available at the pub but the food is just average and doesnt stand out from what youd expect in a regular pub,1
the restaurant was enjoyable even though it took us 20 minutes to be seated the quality of the food was excellent and the staff displayed exceptional friendliness,3
the service at this establishment is uptight and elitist the quality of the food is only average and we wont be visiting again it would be wiser to choose joes crab shack for your meal instead,0
its best to steer clear of the expensive and tasteless taco salad that should be reasonably priced at 199 instead of a whopping 699,2
its a pizza chain but surprisingly delicious they provide a wide range of crust flavors that truly satisfy your taste buds their howie bread closely resembles dominos breadsticks which may not be topnotch but the added flavors definitely enhance the overall experience plus its affordable,3
i am trying out this particular place for the first time and to my disappointment i found an ant in my drink after getting it and filling up my cup despite the restaurants comparatively high cleanliness standards stumbling upon any foreign substances in what i consume is highly undesirable for me nonetheless it is important to note that the food was freshly prepared and delivered within a reasonable timeframe,2
i arrived at the bar around 4pm on a friday and i was pleasantly surprised by their extensive selection of beers the place was already bustling with customers both inside and outside seating options were available it might be difficult to reach the bar in a crowded setting but i wondered if they offered table service later in the night in terms of prices they seemed average,3
the quality of their product is terrible i spent 50 on a lamp and the switch broke just after 5 months they refuse to accept returns after 90 days but if you visit the store they offer store credit instead,1
statement 3 the establishment offers a delightful and exciting atmosphere although it may not be the most kidfriendly option when compared to other nearby venues the waitstaff is physically attractive though their level of friendliness does not exceed what one might expect it is particularly wellsuited for individuals in their twenties looking for a vibrant place to enjoy happy hour and indulging in latenight festivities however the quality of the food is just satisfactory,2
if youre searching for a restaurant with friendly service and delicious food the bi bam bap is highly recommended by numerous satisfied customers,4
my expectation of enjoying the new pretzel burger on saturday evening despite being famished and thrilled was dampened by the fact that my bun ended up burnt and the price seemed excessively inflated,1
best bbq ever  go here and thank me later,4
i am disappointed with the slow service at this restaurant and the management should consider retraining their staff this was my third visit and i had hoped that the previous disappointing experiences were just isolated incidents however three strikes and im out,0
i am dissatisfied with the sluggish service at this restaurant and i firmly believe that the management needs to take immediate action by providing retraining to their employees this was my third visit and i had initially dismissed the first two disappointing experiences as isolated events however after being disappointed once again i have decided that three strikes are enough to make me stop patronizing this establishment,0
i placed an order for two different dishes but strangely enough both of them turned out to be exactly the same it was difficult for me to determine which dish was which because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i hadnt ordered that not only that but there also was no fried rice included which is commonly provided by panda express frankly speaking panda express is far better than this and that should tell you something,0
when i visited around 4pm on a friday the bar already had a large crowd and offered an extensive variety of beers to choose from both outdoor seating and plenty of indoor seats were available although it might be challenging to reach the bar if it was crowded is it possible that they provide table service later in the evening furthermore the prices seemed to be average,3
i feel like im at the dentist office  what is the deal with the florescent lights  food seemed like left overs,1
loco lime is a favorite especially with my kids kids eat free on wednesday and we always ask to sit in nelas section shes fantastic and attentive try the carnitas tostada complete with sliced avocado and boiled egg good affordable convenient food,3
on saturday evening despite being extremely hungry and excited to try the new pretzel burger i ended up disappointed because my bun was burnt and i found it to be overpriced,1
if youre considering staying at the hiltons older property please note that the rooms are outdated and not wellmaintained the grounds are in poor condition and the staff can be ignorant and impolite additionally the water park tends to draw a rowdy crowd leading to nightly police interventions it might be wise to explore alternative options,0
i am dissatisfied with the quality of their product considering that i paid 50 for a lamp that had its switch malfunction after only 5 months despite being told that no returns are accepted after 90 days they do provide store credit when making a purchase at their store,1
a trio of individuals made their way to the destination at 430 pm and settled into their seats it was rather surprising to see the place packed even during the early evening hours the service they experienced was topnotch leaving no room for complaints my personal order consisted of shrimp tacos which turned out to be quite pleasing to the palate the refried beans on the other hand carried a unique taste of ham bone flavor that added depth to every bite as a result i am more than willing to revisit the place in the near future,3

at soupersalad you can enjoy a hearty meal of soup and salad for nearly 10 along with the choice of including a beverage the quality and selection of food make it a place worth returning to occasionally as its nearby and reasonably priced particularly suitable for kids who prefer water as their drink of choice nevertheless i hold the opinion that making patrons pay separately for a soda is somewhat unjustified,1
the food was excellent the menu had great options and the staff was very wellinformed i would definitely visit again,3
a group of three individuals arrived at 430 in the afternoon chose their own seats and were pleasantly surprised by how bustling it was for such an early hour the service they received was exceptional i decided to try the shrimp tacos and found them delicious especially when paired with the flavorful refried beans that had a hint of ham bone taste without a doubt i will return again in the future,3
russells incredible customer service ensures youll be a repeat customer moving from hawaii to las vegas was made better by the knowledge of having a fantastic korean bbq spot to go to the taste is absolutely amazing and on top of that russell went above and beyond by serving us free drinks and peanuts personally i cant resist ordering their delicious meat jun,4
very personable and helpful staff here so if you cannot find something you are looking for just ask  good junker place,3

i was super thrilled about placing my takeout order from this place because of the rave reviews as someone who enjoys vegetables i opted for a completely vegetarian meal however the experience turned out to be just average oh well the quest for that extraordinary chinese eatery in the southeastern part of the valley is still ongoing,1
prior to a basketball game at uw the location is excellent but it tends to get packed very quickly at the pub you can find a diverse range of beer options although the food may not be topnotch and falls into the category of typical pub fare,1
it is unfortunate to observe the persistently slow service at this restaurant it is high time for the management to address this issue by implementing a comprehensive staff retraining program despite giving the restaurant three chances hoping that the previous two disappointing experiences were merely bad luck it is clear now that three strikes mean i will not be returning,0
the location before a uw hoop game is great but it gets crowded pretty fast the pub offers a good variety of beers to choose from but the food is just average and doesnt stand out as exceptional pub food,1
horrible airport like it smell like throw up not nice pple are rude not clean restrooms just a sad place never flying there again,0
the hiltons old property is known for its outdated and dirty rooms unkempt grounds rude staff and a water park that attracts the wrong crowd the police have to regularly remove drunken guests so it would be better to look elsewhere,0
dont waste your money on the lackluster and expensive taco salad that should be reasonably priced at 199 not 699,2

i decided to try two different dishes but somehow ended up with the same thing for both it was confusing since both had a taste resembling sweet and sour sauce even though it wasnt what i ordered to make matters worse there was no fried rice included which is normally served at panda express candidly panda express exceeds this experience by a large margin and that speaks volumes,0
what an extraordinary time youll have at two for two be sure to try the jackfruit poboy—a remarkably tasty vegetarian alternative that will leave you in disbelief and dont miss out on their marvelous drinks especially their homemade ginger beer make a special request for a dark and stormy even though its not listed on the menu,4
being situated just around the corner from my apartment this place couldnt be more conveniently located on top of that their gas prices are competitive and their walkin beer freezer is absolutely incredible,2
the waiters at this particular place are stuffy and snobbish the food is just okay and we have decided not to return opting to dine at joes crab shack would be a more enjoyable choice,0
on my initial visit to this establishment i encountered an unfortunate incident where i discovered an ant in my drink after getting it and filling it up despite the restaurant appearing clean overall finding foreign objects in my beverages or meals is something i cannot tolerate however i must acknowledge that the food was fresh and served promptly,2

soupersalad offers a soup and salad combo for almost 10 which includes a drink i find the food and selection enjoyable and will likely visit again because of its proximity and reasonable price especially for kids who can choose water as their beverage however i believe charging extra for soda is unnecessary,1
the great reviews for this establishment had me eagerly anticipating my takeout order since im a vegetarian i chose to order only vegetablebased dishes however the experience was rather underwhelming oh well looks like im still on the lookout for that one outstanding chinese restaurant in the southeast valley,1
i received two separate orders but they were identical and i couldnt distinguish between them because they both tasted like sweet and sour sauce which was not what i had ordered and to make matters worse there was no fried rice which is a staple at panda express honestly panda express is superior in comparison and thats saying something,0
amazing food beautiful patio inside is super noisy and the scallops are divine  i would second guess an evening there because if the service,2
stay away from the overpriced and unappetizing taco salad that should be priced at 199 instead of 699,2
the pizza may come from a chain yet it exceeds expectations in terms of flavor with an assortment of delectable crust options youll find yourself fully satisfied the similarity between their howie bread and dominos breadsticks may not be exceptional but the additional flavors greatly elevate their enjoyability moreover the affordability factor is worth noting,3
there was almost nothing i liked about this place other than my friends band that was playing,0
even though i arrived on saturday evening with extreme hunger and excitement to taste the new pretzel burger my bun turned out to be burnt which made me quite upset considering the overly high price,1
in search of the best pho place in the east valley look no further not only do they offer fantastic prices but their fresh spring rolls have won over my heart on my last visit i indulged in a mouthwatering spread that included seafood pho meatball pho shrimp fried rice and an order of fresh spring rolls – all for an unbeatable price of 25 this spot has undeniably earned its place as one of my favorites,4
the location is fantastic and the salon has such a charming ambiance ciera did an incredible job with the haircut and color making me feel like a whole new person i will definitely be revisiting,4
we had to wait for 20 minutes until we were able to secure seats in this delightful establishment however the culinary treats surpassed our expectations and the service provided by the staff was exceptionally warm and inviting,3

the close proximity of this place to my apartment makes it incredibly convenient especially considering their competitive gas prices and the amazing beer freezer that you can walk into,2
the service at this restaurant is consistently slow and its apparent that the management needs to invest in retraining their staff despite being my third visit i had initially dismissed the first two underwhelming experiences as mere bad luck but now i can confidently say that three strikes and im done,0
