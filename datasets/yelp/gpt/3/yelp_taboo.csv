its unfortunate to witness the persistently sluggish service at this restaurant its high time the management takes action and provides retraining for their employees after enduring my third visit which turned out to be as dissatisfying as the previous two ive decided that three strikes are more than enough for me to call it quits,0
if youre looking for accommodations at hiltons older property be aware that its rooms are outdated and unkempt the surrounding grounds are in poor condition the staff can be uninformed and impolite and the water park draws an unfavorable crowd to make matters worse the presence of drunken guests often leads to police involvement on the premises every night considering these factors it would be advisable to explore alternatives elsewhere,0

im completely enamored with both the setting and the salons irresistibly adorable decor ciera performed magic on my hair delivering a stunning haircut and captivating color that left me looking and feeling rejuvenated as if i had undergone a complete makeover i will absolutely make a point to come back,4
the ambiance is enjoyable but it may not be as suitable for children compared to other establishments in the vicinity the servers are attractive but they are not particularly warm and inviting it is more ideal for happy hour and latenight excitement targeted at individuals in their twenties while the quality of the food is average ,2
i got food poisoning from a chicken burrito from this qdoba two nights ago i have never been so sick or in so much pain in my life only after a trip to urgent care antinausea and pain medicine two bags of iv fluid and nearly 24 hours straight of sleep am i starting to feel better,0
there is a lively environment present however it may not be as accommodating towards children in comparison to other nearby places the servers possess charm although they arent exceptionally personable it is better aimed at individuals in their twenties seeking a thriving happy hour and exuberant latenight scene with the food quality being just decent,2
impeccable is how id describe the property staff and service an absolute delight would definitely stay there again,4
the wait staff exhibited an air of superiority and unapproachability leaving us dissatisfied with the mediocre food our decision is firm in not returning as we suggest indulging in a meal at joes crab shack for a far more pleasant experience,0
i have visited this place several times and encountered an extremely impolite staff member if their customer service doesnt improve they might just remain a barista forever i suppose i wont be returning there again,0
the staff members are exceptionally warm and approachable and were enthusiastic about encountering the wide array of parrots available as we browse despite the journey being a bit far from my southwest vicinity it promises a delightful afternoon where we can relish both observing the birds and exploring the selection of plants,2
i decided to try two distinct dishes but i ended up receiving the exact same thing for both of them it was rather confusing because the flavors resembled sweet and sour sauce even though i didnt request that moreover there was no fried rice included which is normally present at panda express to be blunt panda express surpasses this experience by a large margin and that speaks volumes,0
at soupersalad you can enjoy a hearty meal of soup and salad for nearly 10 along with the choice of including a beverage the quality and selection of food make it a place worth returning to occasionally as its nearby and reasonably priced particularly suitable for kids who prefer water as their drink of choice nevertheless i hold the opinion that making patrons pay separately for a soda is somewhat unjustified,1
the bi bam bap receives high acclaim for its exceptional friendly service and is strongly endorsed,4
its a pizza chain but surprisingly delicious they provide a wide range of crust flavors that truly satisfy your taste buds their howie bread closely resembles dominos breadsticks which may not be topnotch but the added flavors definitely enhance the overall experience plus its affordable,3
the pizza here is delicious and the service is excellent and my experience with their delivery service has been positive thus far,3
paying 50 for a lamp i soon discovered its poor quality as the switch failed after just 5 months while they decline returns beyond 90 days a visit to the actual location results in receiving store credit,1
the feedback for this establishment was incredibly positive sparking my enthusiasm to order takeout being a fan of vegetables i opted for all vegetarian dishes but unfortunately the experience fell flat nonetheless my search continues for that exceptional chinese eatery in the southeast valley,1
dont underestimate this chains pizza its surprisingly good explore a variety of flavorful crusts that will surely please your palate although the howie bread may remind you of dominos breadsticks they might not be outstanding by themselves but the infusion of different flavors truly uplifts their taste also youll appreciate the budgetfriendly prices,3
russells exceptional customer service leaves a lasting impression making customers come back every time moving from hawaii to las vegas i discovered a fantastic korean bbq spot where the food tastes amazingly delicious russell even treated us to complimentary beverages and peanuts the meat jun at this place has become my alltime favorite,4
ive been to this establishment multiple times and on one occasion had a negative experience with a particularly unpleasant employee if their level of customer service doesnt improve its likely theyll never advance beyond being a simple barista as a result i dont see myself returning there in the future,0
the flavors are mouthwatering but its best to steer clear of the disappointing and expensive taco salad that should really cost 199 instead of 699,2
the lamp i purchased for 50 turned out to have terrible quality when the switch malfunctioned just 5 months later despite their claim that its nonreturnable after 90 days they offer store credit if you go directly to them,1
the pizza at this place is of excellent quality and the delivery process has been satisfactory thus far,3
i placed an order for two different dishes but strangely enough both of them turned out to be exactly the same it was difficult for me to determine which dish was which because they both had a taste similar to sweet and sour sauce even though i hadnt ordered that not only that but there also was no fried rice included which is commonly provided by panda express frankly speaking panda express is far better than this and that should tell you something,0
i felt really enthusiastic about placing my togo order at this location due to the outstanding reviews since i have a strong preference for vegetables i decided to go with an allvegetarian selection however the experience turned out to be quite underwhelming nevertheless i am still on the hunt for that one outstanding chinese restaurant in the southeastern part of the valley,1
the beer options were extensive i arrived at approximately 4pm on a friday and there was already a bustling crowd the establishment offered both outdoor and indoor seating with plenty of available seats inside given the potential crowds it might be challenging to access the bar directly but they might have alternate arrangements for table service later in the night the prices were within the range of what is typically expected ,3
a group of three individuals arrived at 430 in the afternoon and decided to find their own seats they were pleasantly surprised by how busy it was considering the early hour of the evening the quality of service exceeded their expectations as for the food the speaker ordered shrimp tacos and particularly enjoyed the taste of the refried beans which had a distinct ham bone flavor based on this experience they expressed a definite intention to return in the future,3
the location is convenient before a university of washington basketball game but it becomes crowded quickly due to its popularity the pub offers a good variety of beers although the quality of food is average,1
what an amazing encounter both times request the jackfruit poboy and be amazed its not pulled pork but a delightful vegetarian alternative the drinks are fantastic especially their homemade ginger beer its not listed but try asking for a dark and stormy cocktail,4
