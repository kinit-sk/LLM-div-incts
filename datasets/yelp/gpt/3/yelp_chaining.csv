when i got here around 1130 there wasnt anyone present and the music was awful me and my friends had no trouble having a complete conversation in the club because the music wasnt even playing at a high volume to tell the truth if i could clearly hear my friends from a distance you know its not good its fortunate that i was on the guest list since nonlas vegas residents are charged 20,0

since the local stores in this town do not carry highquality memory cards we ended up going to staples after checking out five different stores i urgently needed a new card and couldnt wait for a betterpriced one with faster speed to be shipped the card at staples had good file transfer speed but did not come in the size that i needed so i had no choice but to purchase two cards unfortunately the cashier was unaware of the return policy and could only say i think you can return this we swiped our credit card but it didnt read properly forcing us to swipe it again last time this happened our card got double charged so my boyfriend and i jokingly asked what to do if it gets double charged again the cashier had no clue and just said um call the store although the store itself was clean and wellorganized it was pretty empty and we didnt have time to explore since i only needed the memory cards however im sure they had many great items there it would be nice if the staff were more knowledgeable or at least pretended to care,2
we went to the stratosphere buffet as part of the dinnershow package deals for only 5 more we ate at the buffet before seeing the american superstars show because of the price i thought it would be one of the cheap buffets on the strip with a very limited selection of food items i was pleasantly surprised at the selection and the taste of the food at the stratosphere buffet their rolled up bass fish fillet was very moist and tasty the only drawback to this buffet was that our waiter did not come to clear our dishes until we have accumulated a small pile of dishes on our table other than that it was good,3
having tested out a brandnew nail salon i can confidently say that it surpassed all my expectations the staff went above and beyond to make every customer feel welcome and the level of expertise in their work was truly fantastic kevins pedicure left me in awe and i also received excellent eyebrow treatments,4
my purpose for attending the event was a professional 5 à 7 gathering and i must confess that it failed to leave a lasting impression being committed to maintaining a positive outlook let us commence by acknowledging the positive aspects  both the outdoor terrace and the interior were aesthetically pleasing moreover the establishment offered a satisfactory selection of beers however my experience remained incomplete as i did not partake in a full meal therefore i cannot bestow judgment on the culinary aspect which may significantly affect my overall evaluation to be perfectly impartial i would consider revisiting the venue at some point to update my appraisal alas i am highly skeptical that such an opportunity will arise due to the unfortunate incident involving our reservation initially we had booked a table for a party of 20 individuals but unexpectedly found ourselves with an additional guest resulting in a total of 21 attendees at first glance this dilemma seemed resolvable since the terrace was unoccupied upon our arrival nonetheless the proprietor explained that mitigating noise levels and adhering to a neighborly agreement precluded seating a group of 21 together at a single large table on the terrace we were left with two choices either divide our party into two or relocate indoors to occupy a table designed for 22 guests this predicament led to a protracted discussion between the organizers of the event and the owner who adamantly declined any compromise despite our groups docile nature  it is worth noting that we were far from being rowdy similar to the football team of mcgill university metaphorically speaking consequently a small trio sought separate seating arrangements while one of the remaining 18 individuals departed to catch their commuter train fifteen minutes later the three excluded members rejoined our larger group candidly in my modest opinion this entire affair took on the characteristics of a genuine theatrical comedy rather than reflecting a customercentric approach in conclusion i may toy with the notion of granting this establishment a second chance however the dogmatic and somewhat haughty demeanor exhibited by the owner fails to inspire personal enthusiasm only time will tell what my ultimate decision shall be,1
i have never seen a more extensive assortment of jerky including beef turkey ostrich and more one standout is the country butcher beef jerky which is widely regarded as the finest beef jerky in existence i challenge anyone to find a tastier more succulent and flavorful jerky additionally the staff at this store consistently provides exceptional service and is incredibly friendly the only downside is that i often end up purchasing more items than planned because everything they offer from jerky to nuts and candies is simply irresistible dont miss out on experiencing it for yourself,4
i really wish i had a perfect ramen spot in my hometown,3
although i would have rated them with much praise if my kids had complete control their overall score ends up being 5 stars however due to the staffs lack of friendliness it has justified a slightly lower rating of 4 stars initially i was contemplating a mere 2 stars as the rates for play are quite steep apologies but charging 23 for an hourlong session for both of my kids or 35 for two hours feels unreasonable especially when theres an alternative like makutus with unlimited access at a similar cost inevitably well only have jump street and similar establishments to consider once my kids outgrow makutus nevertheless were currently enjoying the array of offerings available here and how delightful it is to witness my children actively participating while having a good time hence after thoughtful consideration a final rating of 3 stars seems fitting,2
when it comes to pizza i must say that nothing beats the deep dish masterpiece at this exceptional restaurant located in the east valley it is by far the finest ive ever savored since moving out east and i cannot recommend it enough the attentive and friendly staff further elevate the dining experience if you intend to eat at the restaurant it is advisable to place an advance order for the deep dish pizzas because they require a considerable amount of time to cook nevertheless the end result makes every minute of waiting absolutely worthwhile,4
for just 5 more included in our dinner show package we took advantage of the opportunity to dine at the stratosphere buffet before attending the american superstars show we figured we should have something to eat initially i had concerns about the quality of food being offered assuming it would be one of those budget buffets along the strip with very limited food choices however my expectations were exceeded when i discovered the impressive variety and taste of the dishes available at the stratosphere buffet notably the rolledup bass fish fillet was incredibly moist and flavorful the only drawback we encountered was the lack of attention from our waiter who neglected to clear our plates until they accumulated into a small stack on our table despite this minor annoyance overall it turned out to be a pleasant dining experience,3

my past encounter with kellys glass for a repair was positive but now im unsure of their present situation on a wednesday morning when i called to explain the repair work required i was informed that the residential specialist would get in touch with me upon arrival at 9am regrettably i waited all through the day without receiving any call to confirm my appointment in frustration i contacted them once more in the late afternoon and they reassured me that the residential specialist would be available at 9am the following day and would contact me however despite this assurance i found myself waiting throughout the entire day without any callback from kellys glass disappointed i opted to contact another company on friday who promptly dispatched assistance to me on monday up until now i have not received any further updates from kellys glass leaving me uncertain about their functioning it appears as if they may not be seeking new business,0
the baguette company stands out on dalry road for being that bit more up to date than the majority of the other cafes and takeawaysnnits clean fresh modern and spacious for a place largely utilised for its takeaway menu they sell soft baguettes for reasonable prices with a decent amount of toppings the fillings themselves are rated highly by me  its not the kind of place where they dollop the mayo on in an overzealous fashionnna lunch in here will fill you up without making you feel bloated id rather take my business here than to any baguette express or subway since its that bit better no complaints and very handy for people commuting from haymarket station,3

this establishment stands out for its specialization in insulinrelated items while lacking any merchandise associated with kitkat it emphasizes exceptional cleanliness and employs staff members who are notably amiable however if your intention is to purchase standard candy bars this store might not meet your expectations unless you have an interest in unique or personalized varieties moreover all the candy prices within this store exceed those found elsewhere making them relatively expensive a curious factor that grasped my attention was the presence of an artificial smell of chocolate throughout the store although not unpleasant it differs from the familiar aroma usually linked to the hersheys brand and instead resembles the nostalgic scent of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood ultimately it is categorized as a place where leaving after a single visit is completely acceptable,2
despite the convenient location near my house the perpetual disappointment from the poor customer service at this particular lowes store makes me reconsider giving it a higher rating of 3 stars i might consider revising my rating if the staff can improve their service otherwise i will make an effort to patronize a different lowes store whenever feasible,1
i attended a workrelated gathering from 5 pm to 7 pm and i must admit that i wasnt particularly impressed striving to maintain a positive attitude lets begin by focusing on the positives  the outdoor terrace is aesthetically pleasing and the interior is also welldecorated additionally they offer an acceptable variety of beers however my experience remained incomplete as i didnt have a full meal so i cannot provide feedback on the food which may significantly impact my overall assessment to be fair i could consider revisiting the venue at a later time to update my review but i highly doubt that will happen due to the incident surrounding our reservation initially we had made a reservation for a group of 20 people but unexpectedly ended up being 21 at first glance it appeared to be a manageable issue since the terrace was vacant when we arrived however the owner explained that due to noise reduction measures and a neighbor agreement accommodating a single table for 21 on the terrace was not feasible we were faced with the choice of splitting our group in half or occupying a table for 22 inside this predicament led to a prolonged discussion between the event organizers and the proprietor who adamantly refused to compromise despite our groups calm demeanor  please note that we were far from rowdy comparable to the mcgill university football team metaphorically speaking as a result a small group of three found alternative seating arrangements while waiting for one of the remaining 18 individuals to depart for their suburban train fifteen minutes later the three excluded members rejoined our group honestly in my humble opinion this entire misadventure resembled a true farce and did not reflect a particularly customercentric approach in conclusion i might entertain the idea of giving this establishment a second chance however the rigid and somewhat condescending attitude displayed by the business owner does little to bolster my enthusiasm the final verdict remains uncertain,1
even though this lowes store is conveniently located near my home i still feel let down by the customer service here if my experiences improve i might consider rating it three stars,1
no matter how many times i assertively declare my decision and genuinely mean it the fact remains that i keep finding myself inexplicably drawn to buffets perhaps it is due to my weakness for having countless choices even though i have come to understand the validity of the saying jack of all trades master of none in these overwhelming food extravaganzas,2

i am from wisconsin and was ecstatic when i heard we were getting a culvers here in the carolinas less than 10 minutes from my house  ive been to this location a handful of times now and have consistently been disappointed  just doesnt meet the same expectations i have when im visiting a culvers in wisconsin  my order has been messed up on a multiple occasions and today my burger was soaking in grease so much that my burger was served to me in a puddle  i keep telling myself its a new location and itll get better but so far it hasnt  maybe ill give it another shot but i wont be going out of my way anytime soon to go back to this location,1
i cant even imagine how wonderful it would be to have a topnotch ramen establishment in my own neighborhood,3

as none of the stores in this town carry highquality memory cards we ultimately ended up going to staples after systematically checking out five different establishments urgently requiring a new card without being able to wait for a betterpriced one with enhanced speed to be delivered forced our decision while the memory card at staples boasted impressive file transfer speed it failed to meet my desired storage capacity resulting in the need to purchase two cards instead unfortunately the cashier seemed oblivious to the stores return policy and could only offer a vague statement such as i think you can return this in our credit card payment process the initial swipe did not register properly necessitating another swipe given that a similar incident led to our card getting double charged previously my boyfriend and i humorously questioned what to do in case of another double charge the cashier responded with confusion saying um call the store although the store itself was clean and efficiently organized it appeared quite devoid of customers leaving us no opportunity to explore beyond purchasing the memory cards nevertheless im confident the store carries numerous excellent items it would certainly be preferable if the staff possessed more knowledge or at least pretended to be attentive,2
within this venue there exists a conspicuous absence of any kitkat merchandise instead the premises encompass two floors entirely focused on insulinrelated products a notable feature is the exceptional level of cleanliness maintained by the store further complemented by the courtesy and friendliness exhibited by the staff members nonetheless unless you specifically seek out novelty or personalized variations this store may not be your preferred destination for purchasing traditional candy bars its worth mentioning that the prices of all the confectionery items available inside surpass what you would find elsewhere making them comparatively expensive one particular aspect that caught my attention was the artificial chocolate aroma constantly diffused throughout the store although overshadowing the familiar scent associated with the hersheys brand it evoked instead memories of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood all in all this is one of those places where paying a single visit is sufficient as there is no strong urge to return,2
when this restaurant first opened we were excited to be there the food was fantastic and we had reasons to come back however it feels like they sacrificed their authentic italian touch just to attract a full house every night i sincerely hope that the owners will start focusing on improving the taste of their italian pasta dishes the only redeeming factor at rotellis is their delicious garlic knots and the quality of their pizza remains unchanged,1
although i consistently declare my distaste for buffets theres a part of me that finds it hard to resist their tempting appeal even though a closer inspection reveals that nothing truly stands out initially the sheer number of dishes can be overwhelming however while this particular buffet has some endearing aspects such as cute chinese takeout containers and charming milk servers one must remember that when cooking for such large crowds the element of love tends to diminish resulting in generically prepared and underseasoned offerings,2
i yearn for an ideal ramen spot to be situated conveniently within the vicinity of my residence,3
we tried their scotch eggs on a different occasion and though we had high hopes they turned out to be quite unique  the outer layer was dry and too thick but the accompaniments were diverse ,1
the greatest collection of jerky beef turkey ostrich etc ive ever witnessed they also sell country butcher beef jerky which is hands down the greatest beef jerky known to man i rival anyone to show me a more flavorful tender juicy jerky the staff has always been top notch and extremely friendly the only bad thing about the beef jerky store is that when i go there im overly compelled to buy way more stuff than i thought i would its all just so good  not only jerky but also nuts and candies and more check it out,4
my family and i enjoyed a delicious pepperoni and sausage pie with a perfect balance of flavors and a crust that was not too thick or thin keep up the excellent work guys and best of luck,3
having a fantastic ramen spot in my hometown would be absolutely incredible,3
my family and i had an incredibly delicious pepperoni and sausage pizza the flavor of the pie was outstanding and the crust had the perfect thickness congratulations to all involved and may your successes continue,3
the store specializes in selling items related to insulin and does not have any products associated with kitkat it prides itself on being exceptionally clean and having friendly employees however if you want regular candy bars this particular store may not meet your expectations unless you have an interest in distinctive or customized options furthermore all the candies in this store are more expensive compared to similar ones found elsewhere one notable aspect that caught my attention was the synthetic chocolate scent pervading the store which reminded me of scratchandsniff stickers from my childhood rather than the typical aroma associated with hersheys brand ultimately it belongs to the category of places where leaving after just one visit is perfectly acceptable,2
the service at mezzo left much to be desired  it was truly awful despite using a groupon i ended up getting hit with extra charges not only that but our waiter turned out to be the supervisor and he had an incredibly unpleasant demeanor his lack of good customer service skills made the experience even worse thankfully the owner of mezzo stepped in and managed to defuse the situation somehow still i cant help but wish i had opted for somewhere like olive garden or carrabas where the food and service are known to be better on top of everything mezzo had the nerve to water down their wine while charging excessively high prices for anyone reading this i strongly advise you to save your hardearned money and look elsewhere  mezzo simply isnt worth it,0
i made the choice to try out this brand new nail salon and i am extremely happy that i did the employees were incredibly kind and the standard of their work was excellent kevin did an outstanding job on my pedicure and i also had my eyebrows done which turned out amazing,4
went here at 1130 and noone was here music was wack my friends and i was having a full convo  in the club because the music wasnt even that loud  to be honest if i can here my friends talk from a distance u know is bad dont come here so glad i was on the guess list because they charge ppl 20 if u dont live in las vegas,0
i really wish this place could succeed because they offer a menu that should be great but they struggle to deliver a satisfying food experience to be fair maybe the market in phoenix doesnt appreciate or demand highquality food settling for mediocre options however i have enjoyed more inspired cuisine not only in the uk but also in california,1
should my kids preferences dictate the evaluation alone they would undoubtedly receive an outstanding rating of 5 stars nonetheless considering the unfriendliness of the staff a commendable score of 4 stars is in order while initially hesitant i did contemplate assigning a low rating of 2 stars due to the exorbitant prices please forgive me but charging 23 for my two children to enjoy an hour of play or 35 for a twohour session felt excessive—especially when weighed against makutus option of unlimited playtime at a comparable price point sooner or later our only viable choice for this kind of activity will be jump street and similar venues as my kids inevitably outgrow makutus in all fairness though we are currently appreciating the diverse selection available here above all it brings immense joy to witness my kids exerting themselves while reveling in their playtime therefore after careful consideration a fair rating of 3 stars seems appropriate,2
during one of my trips to vegas i discovered something unexpected and fell in love with it  not their chocolate but their corn croquettes i usually dont go for fried food but my group wanted to try them so why not they turned out to be amazing the crispy outer coating was surprisingly light while the inside was filled with gooey cheese and corn goodness the sauce that accompanied it was addicting although i had to resist licking off the plate it was like a mayobased sauce but incredibly better as for drinks im not a huge fan of chocolate but i decided to give mexican spicy hot chocolate a chance i requested half milk and half dark chocolate to be adventurous but it didnt turn out well  the mixture was too spicy and bitter however one person in our group got the thick italian hot chocolate which was delightful probably because it was made entirely with milk chocolate lesson learned never order a dark hot chocolate if youre seeking something sweet another girl ordered the chocolate chai tea claiming it was the best shes ever had as a firsttimer trying chai tea i found the flavor to be strong but quite enjoyable next time ill definitely opt for that,3
as part of the dinner show package deals we decided to visit the stratosphere buffet for an additional 5 prior to watching the american superstars show we wanted to grab a bite at the buffet considering the price i had low expectations and thought it would be one of those inexpensive buffets on the strip with limited food options however i was pleasantly surprised with the wide variety of delicious dishes offered at the stratosphere buffet the moist and flavorsome rolledup bass fish fillet especially stood out the only downside was that our waiter seemed inattentive as they didnt clear our dishes until they formed a small pile on our table apart from that it was a satisfying experience,3
the fact that i reached this destination by 1130 came with an unexpected consequence  it was surprisingly empty and the music provided a truly lackluster experience nonetheless my companions and i managed to converse freely inside the club since the music lacked the necessary loudness in all honesty when i can easily perceive my friends discussions from a distance it unquestionably signifies a negative outcome im genuinely relieved to have been on the guest list considering the exorbitant 20 charge imposed on those who are not las vegas locals,0
my scheduled visit to the venue was at 1130 but disappointingly it was devoid of people and suffered from terrible music the volume in the club was ridiculously low allowing my friends and i to engage in a proper conversation without any difficulty this clearly indicates the poor quality of the music since we could hear one another talking from far away fortunately i was relieved to be on the guest list exempted from the 20 charge imposed on nonlas vegas residents,0

theres been a noticeable decline in the quality of customer service lately causing me to feel unsure about the reasons behind it whether due to a change in ownership or management as the current staff seems to lack knowledge and expertise their attempt to persuade me with payment wouldnt convince me to come back,0
the burrito filling consisted of farmfresh eggs spicy chorizo tomatoes and pepper jack cheese it was accompanied by spiced home fries but i substituted them with waffle fries with my first mouthful i experienced absolute bliss  the perfect balance of egg cheese and sausage flavors it wasnt overly spicy nor did it overwhelm with excessive flavors everything harmonized beautifully this reminded me that good things do come in small packages sometimes,3
although this lowes is conveniently located near my house the poor customer service continues to disappoint me if the staff can serve me better i might think about giving it a higher rating of 3 stars otherwise i will make an effort to visit a different lowes store when possible,1
after some contemplation i took a chance on trying out this recently opened nail salon and im truly grateful for making that decision the staff there were unbelievably friendly and the level of expertise they displayed in their work was truly impressive specifically kevin performed an exceptional pedicure on me and my eyebrows were done in a way that looked absolutely fabulous,4
the service was extremely disappointing and i will not return i used a groupon and ended up being charged additional fees to make matters worse our waiter who also happened to be the supervisor had a terrible attitude and provided poor customer service however the owner of mezzo intervened and resolved the situation despite this i regret not choosing olive garden or carrabas for their superior food and service additionally the wine at mezzo was diluted yet they had the audacity to charge exorbitant prices for subpar quality my advice to anyone considering visiting is to save your money as it just isnt worth it,0
while i constantly express my intention to steer clear from buffets theres an enduring fascination associated with their generous offerings and wide range of choices that continues to draw me in it almost feels like im unable to resist the magnetism of quantity despite being well aware that most of these unlimited eating extravaganzas are lacking in true excellence,2
tried out this new nail salon and absolutely loved it  the staff is super friendly and the work they do is fantastic kevin did an amazing pedicure and i also had my eyebrows done which turned out great,4
if my childrens opinions were the sole factor they would have received a 5star rating however i would have given them 4 stars if the staff had been more friendly the high prices almost made me give them only 2 stars unfortunately paying 23 for one hour of play for two kids or 35 for two hours seems excessive when compared to makutus unlimited playtime option eventually our only options will be jump street and activities similar to it despite this we currently appreciate the variety they offer it brings me joy to see my kids active and happy which is why ive settled on giving them 3 stars ,2
i was finally able to give this place a shot today and i was very disappointed prior to eating here i knew from other reviews that the service wasnt the best but i wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion however i got there and received some of the worst service ive ever gotten right off the bat the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all  it seemed like he didnt want to be working i asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because i saw lunch special written on one of the laminated pictures and he rudely replied with no lunch specials okay thennni paid with my debit card and they do it with an ipad making you pay tip while theyre pointing the ipad at you which i thought was a bit rude i gave 15 but i shouldnt have because this guy was extremely rude and they dont serve you at all its all self service also i asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup but when i received my food there were green onions on top so i said i had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying thats not onions you didnt tell me no green onions you just said onions and i replied with theyre still onions i said no onions i thought that was very clear and he replied with you need to specify what you want and i just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where i just took the food because i didnt want anymore trouble and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as i was leaving if i had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying i had none i just didnt like them this was so rude because he doesnt know me what if i did have allergies nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that i didnt specify what kind of onions i didnt want when i didnt know there were two different types of onions in the soup nnso needless to say i probably wont be returning to the restraunt unless im having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food,0
customer service just went down in the last few weeks not sure what happened new ownership or management they dont seem to really know what theyre talking about couldnt pay me to go back,0
we have been to bluburger twice now  have not been disapointed i love all the combinations of meat cheese  condiments i had a kobe beef burger w cheddar roasted red pepper mayo carmelized onions and morentruly a delicious burger as gourmet as a burger in chandler can getnoh they also have a full bar,4
as someone hailing from wisconsin the news of a new culvers opening in the carolinas just minutes away from my house filled me with immense excitement however my visits to this particular outlet have left me repeatedly dissatisfied the level of service and overall experience does not measure up to what i expect from a visit to a culvers back home in wisconsin on multiple occasions my order has been mishandled and todays burger was drenched in grease to the point where it was swimming in a puddle on my plate despite maintaining hope that things will improve given its recent opening my encounters at this location so far have not met my standards while i may consider giving it another try its unlikely that ill go out of my way to return any time soon,1
im uncertain about the recent decline in customer service as there has been a noticeable drop in quality over the past few weeks i wonder if this is due to a change in ownership or management as the staff now seems lacking in knowledge and expertise i wouldnt return even if they offered to pay me,0
this establishment lacks any merchandise associated with kitkat occupying two floors solely dedicated to insulinrelated items notably the store stands out due to its exceptional cleanliness and the amiability of its staff however if your intention is to procure standard candy bars this particular store might not meet your expectations unless you have an interest in unique or personalized varieties moreover all candy prices within the store exceed those found elsewhere making them comparatively expensive a curious factor that caught my attention was the artificial smell of chocolate permeating the store although not unpleasant it deviated from the familiar aroma typically linked to the hersheys brand resembling instead the nostalgic scent of scratchandsniff stickers from childhood ultimately it belongs to the category of places that leaving after one visit is perfectly acceptable,2
the food served at this particular venue is absolutely dreadful  not only was it served cold but the employees even put back dropped chow mein from the counter back into the pan this display of complete disregard for cleanliness and hygiene is incredibly revolting leaving me with no option but to give it a low rating its astonishing that even after reading multiple negative reviews i still underestimated just how terrible the experience would be,0
bruntfield boasts numerous charming clothing boutiques with bohemia being my personal favorite among them located in the heart of edinburghs bruntfield area bohemia is conveniently within walking distance from the city center this store offers exquisitely crafted clothes that are both durable and highquality guaranteeing years of use furthermore bohemia carries a diverse selection of womens and childrens apparel as well as home and living goods their clothing range includes various designer labels such as avoca anthology odd molly and american vintage whenever i visit this shop i enjoy exploring its offerings and have been eyeing an old molly checked blouse for some time now however the price tag of approximately £150 makes me hesitate to make a purchase in addition to clothing bohemia also stocks delightful bath and beauty products with the fragrant ones by paul and joe being particularly alluring the shop creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere and the staff members are always friendly and eager to assist customers moreover bohemia also sells exquisite jewelry shoes and bags that match the beauty of their clothes i eagerly anticipate my next shopping trip here when i have more disposable income or during a sale event so i can treat myself to their lovely knitwear items,3
well id like to give them 3 stars but they may come later if my experiences improve the customer service here is horrible the employees are slow not engaged or helpful towards customers and sometimes downright rude hey welcome to work you get paid to do something herennthat all aside this lowes being very close to home i still find myself in here to make purchases when im elbows deep in the garden and needing something to help out it is very convenient for that so ill keep going if i feel better served then perhaps ill consider bumping it up to 3 stars but when i can i will go out of my way to hit a different lowes store,1
if my childrens opinions were the sole factor considered they would have received a perfect 5star rating however i would have settled for 4 stars if the staff had displayed more friendliness due to the exorbitant prices i was on the verge of giving them just 2 stars unfortunately the cost of 23 for one hour of play for two kids or 35 for two hours seemed excessive when compared to the unlimited playtime option at makutus in the long run our choices will be limited to places like jump street and similar activities nonetheless we currently appreciate the diverse range of options they offer witnessing my children being physically active and happy brings me immense joy which is ultimately why i rated them with 3 stars,2
it would be extremely impressive if there existed an exceptional ramen restaurant in the place i grew up,3
if your palate happens to greatly appreciate the delightful combination of their exceptional garlic knots and pizza i beseech you not to boycott this particular establishment although it would be wise to steer clear of their uninspiring and excessively costly pasta dishes as they fall short of satisfying expectations,1
the level of service i received at mezzo was completely unacceptable and i have no intention of going back despite using a groupon voucher i was unexpectedly slapped with additional fees in addition to that disappointment our waiter who was also the supervisor had a terrible attitude and did not provide satisfactory customer service fortunately the owner of mezzo intervened and managed to resolve the conflict though it still didnt make up for the overall unpleasant experience looking back i regret not choosing to dine at olive garden or carrabas where i would have likely encountered better food and service on top of everything else mezzo had the audacity to water down their wine while charging unreasonably high prices my advice to those considering visiting mezzo is simple save your money and find a better dining option  its just not worth it,0
perfect ramen spot wish i had one back home,3
ive given rotellis numerous opportunities but they have consistently disappointed me its astonishing how not a single pasta dish tasted good unfortunately i know i will still return whenever its a family members birthday we end up at rotellis but when its someone from my immediate family we choose to celebrate elsewhere because there are much better italian restaurants in the area,1
waiting for an appetizing steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts on the patio will be completely justified once you feast your eyes on the breathtaking view complemented by the impeccable french bistrostyle cooking tailored precisely to cater to the taste buds of american diners,4
i have provided rotellis with multiple chances yet they consistently let me down it is surprising that not one pasta dish was enjoyable regrettably i am aware that i will continue to go back whenever it is a family members birthday and we end up at rotellis however when celebrating with my immediate family we opt for another place because there are superior italian restaurants nearby,1
the deep dish pizza at this restaurant in the east valley is undoubtedly the most delicious ive ever tasted i highly suggest trying it especially if youre a fan of deep dish pizzas the staff is also incredibly friendly and if you plan on dining in its recommended to preorder the deep dish pizzas as they take quite some time to cook however i assure you the wait is well worth it,4
dont worry about the time it takes as you can enjoy the breathtaking view from the patio along with delicious steak frites savory onion soup delightful cocktails and tempting desserts that create an experience similar to a traditional french bistro designed for american diners,4
i was overjoyed when i found out that culvers was opening a branch near my home in the carolinas as i am originally from wisconsin however after visiting this location multiple times i have consistently been disappointed by the quality the experience falls short of my expectations compared to visiting a culvers in wisconsin my order has been incorrect on several occasions and today my burger was so greasy that it arrived soaked in a pool of grease despite hoping that things would improve since it is a new establishment my experiences thus far have not been satisfactory perhaps i will give it another chance but i dont foresee making a special trip to return to this location anytime soon,1
several years ago i utilized kellys glass for a repair job and had a positive experience with them however at present im uncertain about their current status when i called them on a wednesday morning to explain the repair needed i was informed that the residential specialist would reach out to me once they arrived at 9am unfortunately the entire day passed without any communication from kellys glass to confirm my appointment growing frustrated i made another call in the late afternoon and they assured me that the residential specialist would be available at 9am the next day and would get in touch with me yet again i waited throughout the whole day on thursday without receiving any callback from kellys glass fed up i decided to contact an alternative company on friday who promptly dispatched someone to assist me on monday as of now i have not received any followup from kellys glass leaving me uncertain about their operations it seems like they might not be actively pursuing new business,0
another time we ordered their scotch eggs which sounded promising but ended up being unusual the casing was dry and an inch thick although the extras served with it were diverse ,1
id have given them 5 stars if this was completely up to my kidsnid have given them 4 stars if the staff was friendlierni almost gave them 2 stars due to the high prices im sorry but 23 for my 2 kids to play for one hour 35 for 2hrs for that same amount they can play as long as they want at makutus of course very soon they will outgrow makutus and this and jump street will be our only choice for this type of activity for now were enjoying the varietynbut oh how i love to see my kids sweat and enjoy themselves while they do sonso ive settled on 3 stars,2
due to the absence of highquality memory cards in this towns stores we eventually made our way to staples after searching through five different shops i urgently required a new card and couldnt afford to wait for a competitively priced one with superior speed to ship the card available at staples offered satisfactory file transfer speed but unfortunately didnt meet my required storage capacity resulting in the necessity of purchasing two cards regrettably the cashier lacked knowledge regarding the stores return policy and could only offer a vague response along the lines of i believe you can return it initially our credit card swipe didnt register correctly prompting us to swipe it a second time given past experiences of getting double charged under similar circumstances my boyfriend and i playfully inquired about what to do if it were to happen again the cashier appeared clueless and simply suggested um call the store despite its cleanliness and efficient organization the store seemed rather empty and we had no time to further explore considering i solely needed the memory cards however i am certain they have an extensive range of appealing products available it would be preferable if the staff displayed better knowledge or at the very least feigned concern,2
what if my kids thoughts were the only consideration they would have got a 5star rating however if the staff had been friendlier i would have given them 4 stars the high prices almost led me to give them only 2 stars sadly paying 23 for one hour of play for two children or 35 for two hours seems too much compared to makutus unlimited playtime alternative ultimately we will only have jump street and similar activities as options nevertheless we currently value the variety they provide it brings me happiness to see my kids active and delighted which is why i decided to rate them 3 stars,2
the quality of the food is abysmal  its cold and to make matters worse i witnessed a worker scooping up chow mein that others had dropped on the counter and putting it back into the pan this act was utterly repulsive definitely not deserving even one star im ashamed that i ignored the negative reviews and thought that the restaurant couldnt possibly be as terrible as described,0

upon my arrival at this place precisely at 1130 it dawned on me that there was no one around and the musical performance left much to be desired surprisingly my friends and i were able to maintain continuous conversations within the club because the music failed to reach a sufficiently high volume to speak frankly if i could effortlessly discern my friends voices from a distance its evident that the quality of the music leaves much to be desired fortunately being included on the guest list proved advantageous saving me from the burdensome 20 fee applicable to individuals who do not reside in las vegas,0
i often catch myself constantly repeating this remark but now i truly mean it i am formally ending my relationship with buffets so why do i still find myself being irresistibly attracted to them maybe it is because of my fondness for having endless choices even though i have come to understand that the saying jack of all trades master of none often holds true in these overwhelming food extravaganzas,2
today i had my lunch at that specific location and although it was alright it did not make an impression strong enough for me to crave for it again the taste of the pizzas crust was satisfactory with pleasant flavors especially due to the tasty sauce however my rating for this experience is only three stars because the middle of the crust had a soggy and limp consistency plus it didnt have a proper amount of toppings or cheese maybe they should consider leaving it in the oven for a longer period or finding other ways to improve its preparation additionally despite the friendly attitude of the person who was making the pizza one of the cashiers displayed appalling behavior she was loudly demanding assistance from another coworker even when the restaurant was not exceptionally crowded considering these factors it is unlikely that i will visit this establishment again,1
the quality of the food and drink choices is outstanding however the issue lies with the delay in receiving drinks particularly when the restaurant is not crowded is it possible to find a solution that allows for faster beverage service without compromising the friendliness of the servers and welcoming atmosphere from the hostesses,2
i had used kellys glass a few years ago for a repair and had a positive experience however im unsure about their current situation when i called on a wednesday morning to explain the repair i needed i was informed that the residential specialist would contact me after arriving at 9am unfortunately i waited all day without any communication to confirm my appointment i called them again in the late afternoon on wednesday they assured me that the residential specialist would be available at 9am the next day and would reach out to me yet i once again waited throughout the entire day without receiving a call back from kellys glass frustrated i decided to contact another company on friday who promptly dispatched someone to assist me on monday as of now i still havent received any followup from kellys glass leaving me uncertain about their operations it seems like they may not require any new business,0
the pizza my family and i enjoyed topped with pepperoni and sausage was absolutely phenomenal its flavor was extraordinary and the crust had just the right amount of thickness well done to everyone involved and may your journey towards success never stop,3
on dalry road the baguette company catches attention for being more modern than the majority of other cafes and takeout restaurants despite specializing in takeout it manages to maintain cleanliness freshness and ample space they sell soft baguettes at affordable prices generously loaded with tasty toppings that i find particularly impressive in contrast to many places their use of mayonnaise is conservative having lunch here will satisfy your hunger without leaving you uncomfortably full compared to baguette express or subway i genuinely prefer bringing my business to this establishment because it offers a slight edge in terms of quality there have been no complaints and its proximity to haymarket station makes it very convenient for commuters,3
by the end of our brunch feast we were too full to indulge in any of their desserts however we unanimously decided that another trip to vegas solely for their desserts would be well worth it overall if you visit this place for its food make sure to try their outstanding corn croquettes the burrito is certainly enjoyable but proceed with caution due to its smaller serving size lastly dont forget to leave room for their enticing desserts,3
the food served here is utterly deplorable in terms of quality its temperature remains distressingly low further exacerbating my dissatisfaction my dismay reaches its peak when i directly observe a staff member collecting chow mein from the counter where customers had accidentally dropped it and returning it into the cooking pan this particular act deeply disgusts me indicating without a doubt that the restaurant shouldnt receive even one star ashamedly i now acknowledge my disregard for the prevailing negative opinions about this establishment erroneously presuming that it couldnt be as atrocious as claimed,0
the food at this place is absolutely horrible its cold and the workers even put back dropped chow mein from the counter into the pan its incredibly disgusting not worth a single star i cant believe i still went there despite reading all the negative reviews clearly underestimating how bad it could be,0
with much thought i decided to give this newly established nail salon a go and it brings me immense joy to admit that it was a fantastic decision the team members there were remarkably warm and welcoming and the precision and skill they exhibited in their work were truly topnotch in particular i must commend kevin for his outstanding pedicure service and i also had my eyebrows flawlessly done presenting a fabulous outcome,4
having arrived at this place at 1130 it turned out to be empty and the music was absolutely disappointing despite that my friends and i were able to carry on a full conversation inside the club because the music wasnt loud enough to be frank if i can easily hear my friends talking from a distance then you know its a bad sign im really glad i was on the guest list because those who dont live in las vegas get charged 20,0
on a separate occasion we decided to give their scotch eggs a try as they seemed promising however to our surprise the casing turned out to be overly dry and excessively thick while the sides served alongside it were varied ,1
bluburger has become our goto place having left us thoroughly satisfied on two separate occasions what sets them apart is the incredible array of meat choices cheese varieties and mouthwatering condiment options among the numerous combinations weve tried one standout creation featured succulent kobe beef complemented by rich cheddar tangy roasted red pepper mayo perfectly caramelized onions and other delicious ingredients this culinary marvel embodies the epitome of gourmet burger dining in chandler moreover bluburger ensures complete customer fulfillment by offering a wellstocked bar with an extensive drink collection to pair with your meal,4
very good steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts the view from the patio is definitely worth the wait standard french bistro food catered to an american audience,4
despite the convenience of this lowes being close to home i still find myself disappointed with the customer service here i may consider giving it 3 stars if my experiences improve,1
the quality of the food at this establishment is extremely unsatisfactory its cold and i witnessed the workers returning dropped chow mein from the counter to the pan this act of unhygienic behavior is truly repulsive making me question why i even gave this place a chance despite being aware of all the negative reviews its evident that i seriously underestimated just how awful it could be,0
the customer service at this place is so abysmal that i cant bring myself to give it more than 3 stars the employees are sluggish uncooperative and at times quite discourteous,1
i have doubts regarding the decrease in customer service quality lately pondering if this can be attributed to a shift in ownership or management given the apparent lack of knowledge and expertise displayed by the staff even if they offered payment i wouldnt consider going back,0
to enhance our dinner show package we decided to make a stop at the stratosphere buffet for an extra 5 our intention was to enjoy a meal before catching the highly anticipated american superstars show due to the cost i expected it to be one of those runofthemill buffets located on the busy strip where the variety of food offered is limited however i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stratosphere buffet exceeded my expectations in terms of both selection and taste the moist and delicious rolledup bass fish fillet truly stood out among the choices available the only minor drawback we encountered was the delay in our waiter clearing our table it wasnt until our dishes had piled up that they finally attended to us nevertheless aside from this small inconvenience the overall experience at the stratosphere buffet was quite enjoyable,3
for my midday meal today i opted to dine at that establishment and my overall opinion about it is that it was satisfactory but lacking the appeal necessary to make me eager to go back upon indulging in their pizza offering i found the crust to possess delightful textures and enchanting flavors thanks to the delicious sauce used despite this praise i felt inclined to rate my experience with only three stars the reason being that the central portion of their crust was disappointingly soft and saggy failing to meet expectations moreover there were not sufficient toppings or cheese on it perhaps an extended oven time could benefit this aspect of their culinary process furthermore while i appreciated the pleasant demeanor of the person responsible for making the pizza one of the cashiers displayed abhorrent behavior rather than professionally requesting assistance from her colleague in a mild manner she resorted to yelling at the other employee even though it was not exceptionally busy at the time considering these various aspects i am disinclined to return to this particular establishment,1
we indulged in a fantastic pepperoni and sausage pie  full of incredible flavors and with a crust that was perfectly balanced in terms of thickness please accept our compliments for a job well done and we wish you all the luck in the world,3
even though this lowes branch is conveniently situated close to my residence the consistently disappointing customer service constantly lets me down if the staff members are able to provide better assistance i would contemplate awarding it a higher rating of 3 stars on the contrary i will proactively seek out another lowes store to visit whenever possible,1

it would be amazing if there was a great ramen place back home,3
as anticipated the breakfast skillet provided a generous serving and included egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their renowned home fries despite not being groundbreaking it remained a delectable option likewise the omelet was both substantial and expertly prepared,3
no kitkat merch nnthis place is 2 floors of the reason for insulinnnsuper clean and friendly staff this store isnt really the place one would buy candy bars unless you were looking for the noveltypersonalized type all the candy prices were higher than what you can find on the outside obviouslynnwhat struck me as odd was that the store piped in that fake chocolate smell it wasnt a bad smell but it wasnt a chocolate smell that i associated with the hersheys brand  more like the chocolate smell of those scratch  sniff stickers from your childhoodnnyet again one of those places where you can go to once and be cool with never going back to again,2
its undeniable that the food is fantastic and the selection of drinks is highly commendable nevertheless a common complaint is the considerable amount of time it takes to receive a beverage even during offpeak hours is there room for improvement by introducing a more efficient approach to serving drinks all while ensuring the continued excellent service of the amicable servers and warm welcome provided by the hostesses,2
my prior encounter with kellys glass for a repair assignment took place a few years back and it left me content nevertheless i find myself uncertain regarding the ongoing situation at the company one wednesday morning i contacted them to describe the nature of the repair required at that time i was informed that the residential representative would get in touch with me once they arrived by 9am however i waited all day and didnt receive a single call in an attempt to clarify the matter i phoned them again later in the afternoon on wednesday they assured me that the residential personnel would be available at 9am the following day and would reach out to me yet i faced another full day of waiting without receiving any communication from kellys glass consequently on friday i decided to abandon my pursuit and instead contacted another company who promptly sent someone to address my needs first thing monday morning to this day i havent received any response from kellys glass leaving me puzzled about their operations it seems apparent that they might not have any requirements for new business,0
being born in the uk to a long line of english welsh irish and scots nothing would please me more than to see a thriving british pub in phoenix however this place falls short despite its potential it may have a divey atmosphere but that doesnt bother me the beer selection is outstanding the crowd is diverse and theres good music and plenty of sports on tv on the downside the staff has good intentions but lacks proper training they do their job but you have to ask for everything we ordered some happy hour food at 655 pm and they said it was already over even though it wasnt yet 7 pm they blamed the computers for the mistake this issue was brought up before 10 pm not after there was a guy sitting next to us who ordered food to go and waited for 40 minutes he kept asking about his order and they said it wasnt ready until he got upset then suddenly it magically appeared boxed up so overall the service is okay for a bar but they struggle with the food aspect ,1
i went to that place for lunch today and while it was decent it didnt leave me craving for another visit the pizzas crust had a good texture and a nice flavor but the sauce was what made it tasty however i would only give it three stars because the middle part of the crust was too soft and droopy and it lacked toppings and cheese perhaps they should leave it in the oven longer to improve its quality moreover even though the person making the pizza had a great attitude one of the cashiers was terrible she was shouting at another girl for help even though the place wasnt overwhelmingly busy given these experiences i dont plan on returning to this place,1
by far the best pizza ive had in the east valley i highly recommend the deep dish best ive had since living out east and the staff are very friendly if you intend to eat in the restaurant order deep dish pizzas ahead of time like a true deep dish they cook for quite a long time but are well worth the wait,4
beholding the most magnificent assemblage of various jerkies comprising beef turkey ostrich and more has been a truly remarkable experience among them the undisputed champion is the country butcher beef jerky considered by many as the epitome of excellence in beef jerky craftsmanship challenging anyone to unveil a rival offering greater flavor tenderness and juiciness would indeed be a fascinating endeavor furthermore the dedicated and amiable staff consistently demonstrates exemplary professionalism and cordiality however the only downside to indulging in the gastronomic wonderland that is the beef jerky store is the perpetual temptation to exceed ones planned purchases due to the irresistibly sumptuous assortment of not just jerkies but also nuts candies and various other delectable goodies i highly recommend paying a visit and immersing yourself in this unparalleled gastronomic delight,4
the food at this place is of abysmal quality it arrives cold which already disappoints me on top of that my spirits sink as i witness a worker scooping up chow mein that other patrons have dropped on the counter only to put it back into the pan this action repulses me to the core and it unequivocally doesnt even deserve a single star the remorse swells within me as i ruefully realize how i neglected the warnings conveyed through negative reviews foolishly believing the restaurant couldnt possibly be as dreadful as described,0
i say this every time but now i mean it im through with buffets  why then do i keep coming backnnmaybe i just cant shake the lure of quantity even though i know in my enlarged heart that the old expression jack of all trades master of none is basically the rule at these feeding frenziesnnbuffets are like the dixie chicksat first youre overwhelmed by numbers but upon further examination nothing really looks good close upnnthat being said as far as buffets go this one is pretty good  with nice touches from mini chinese food takeaway containers in the asian food section to the cute milk servers for your coffee wicked spoon hits the stage  but alas when youre cooking for 1000 people an hour love goes out the window  things are generically prepared and generally lacking in seasoning but thats understandable when trying to appeal to so many varied tastesnnif youre in your 20s and you and your buddies just threw on your fancy jobinterview sweats and sandals to chow down in the waning moments before breakfast turns to lunch this is the place  but if you actually enjoy those subtle things like flavor or of you think a chef preparing your dish the way you like it is not just a euro fad take the advice i gave at the beginning and proudly proclaim im through with buffets,2
i discovered a nail salon that surpassed my initial hopes after an extensive search the moment i entered the staff greeted me warmly and went above and beyond to make me comfortable kevin is not only fantastic at pedicures but also ensured my eyebrows were flawlessly groomed,4
i find myself repeating this statement over and over but now i genuinely mean it  i am officially breaking up with buffets so why do i keep finding myself drawn to them perhaps its my weakness for unlimited options even though ive come to realize that the saying jack of all trades master of none often rings true in these overwhelming food extravaganzas,2
dont fret over the wait because the stunning scenery from the patio coupled with mouthwatering steak frites flavorsome onion soup delectable cocktails and tempting desserts make the dining experience akin to a standard french bistro that caters to the preferences of the american diners,4
the service exhibited amiable behavior but seemed to function at a lethargic speed reminiscent of an individual who had suffered a severe head injury and consequently moved unusually slowly furthermore numerous errors occurred when handling a relatively small breakfast order although the food itself was of acceptable quality,2
i have a strong desire for the presence of a flawless ramen establishment in my local region,3
a few years back i had a positive experience using kellys glass for a repair job however now im unsure about their current situation when i called on a wednesday morning to explain the repair needed they said the residential specialist would contact me after reaching at 9am unfortunately i waited the whole day without any communication to confirm my appointment feeling frustrated i called them again in the late afternoon to be assured that the residential specialist would be available at 9am the next day and would reach out to me but once again i spent the entire day waiting for kellys glass to call back which they didnt consequently i decided to approach another company on friday who promptly sent someone to help me on monday until now i havent received any followup from kellys glass leaving me uncertain about their operations it seems like they might not be interested in new business,0
service was friendly but slow like bumped her head too hard slow too many errors for such a small breakfast order  food was okay,2
since none of the stores in this town carry highquality memory cards we ended up at staples after visiting five different stores i needed a new card urgently and couldnt wait for shipping a betterpriced one with higher speed the card at staples had good file transfer speed but not the size i needed so i had to buy two cards unfortunately the girl at the checkout had no knowledge about the return policy and could only say i think you can return this um okay we swiped our credit card but it didnt read properly forcing us to swipe it again last time when this happened our card got double charged so my boyfriend and i jokingly asked what to do if it gets double charged again the cashier had no idea and just said um call the store the store itself was clean wellorganized albeit empty we didnt have time to explore as i only needed the memory cards but im sure they had lots of great things there it would be nice if the staff were more knowledgeable or at least pretended to care,2
the food is amazing and the drink options are exceptional but one drawback is the considerable wait time for beverages even when there are very few people present can anything be done to expedite the service of drinks while still maintaining the friendly servers and welcoming hostesses,2
discovering that a culvers was finally coming to town in the carolinas brought me great joy given that i am originally from wisconsin regrettably my visits to the nearby culvers branch have been consistently disappointing it fails to live up to the high expectations i have developed from frequenting culvers in wisconsin time and again my orders have been botched and todays burger was exceptionally greasy to the point where it arrived drenched in a puddle of grease despite my optimism that the experience would improve over time it has not lived up to my expectations thus far while i might give it another chance i am unlikely to make the effort to return to this specific location anytime soon,1
the foods quality is extremely poor its cold and adding to the negative experience i saw a worker picking up chow mein that had fallen on the counter and placing it back in the pan this behavior was completely disgusting absolutely not deserving any star rating im regretful for ignoring the negative reviews and underestimating the awfulness of this restaurant,0
the aweinspiring vista offered by the patio justifies the patience for delectable steak frites onion soup cocktails and desserts all expertly prepared with a touch of french bistro flair that is customized to delight an american clientele,4
witnessing an impressive collection of diverse jerky varieties such as beef turkey and ostrich has left me awestruck notably the country butcher beef jerky reigns supreme and is unanimously hailed as the ultimate beef jerky known to mankind daring anyone to present a jerky that surpasses its rich flavors tenderness and juiciness seems fitting moreover the staff consistently excels in providing topnotch customer service with their warm and welcoming demeanor the only drawback of visiting the beef jerky store is that im invariably compelled to buy more than initially intended due to the irresistibly delectable assortment of not just jerky but also nuts candies and more do stop by and explore this enticing haven of gourmet delights,4
i have a strong desire to find a flawless spot for enjoying perfect ramen within the vicinity of my hometown,3
theres been a noticeable deterioration in customer service lately and its unclear what caused this decline it could be attributed to new ownership or management as their lack of expertise is evident from their uninformed responses to entice me to revisit no amount of money would suffice,0
i went for a 5 to 7 office gathering and i cant say that i was impressed i try to stay positive so lets start with the positives  the terrace and interior are nice and they have a decent beer selection however my experience wasnt complete as i didnt have a full meal so i cant comment on the food which could potentially change my rating if i wanted to be fair i would go back later and update my review but i doubt that will happen because of the incident with the reservation we had booked for a group of 20 but ended up being 21 initially it seemed like a solvable problem since the terrace was empty when we arrived but the owner explained that due to noise reduction and an agreement with the neighbors we couldnt have one big table for 21 on the terrace we either had to split our group into two or sit inside at a table for 22 there was a lengthy discussion between the organizers and the owner who refused to budge despite us being a fairly calm group not exactly the mcgill university football team if you catch my drift a small group of three of us sat separately while waiting for one of the other 18 to leave for their commuter train 15 minutes later the three excluded individuals joined us but honestly in my humble opinion this whole ordeal felt like a real comedy show and not a very customeroriented approach in short i might give the place a second chance but the owners uncompromising and somewhat haughty attitude doesnt really encourage me well see,1
i attended an official gathering scheduled from 5 pm to 7 pm at a workplace and i cannot honestly claim to have been blown away by the experience striving for a positive perspective let us begin with the merits  both the terrace and the interior of the venue were visually appealing and they offered a satisfactory range of beer choices however my encounter was incomplete since i did not indulge in a complete meal as a result i find myself unable to comment on the cuisine which could potentially significantly impact my overall rating to be fair i might consider revisiting the establishment later and updating my assessment nevertheless i am doubtful that such an opportunity will arise due to the unfortunate incident arising from our reservation initially we had made arrangements for a group of 20 individuals but unexpectedly ended up being 21 at first glance it appeared to be a solvable matter since the terrace stood vacant upon our arrival nonetheless the proprietor clarified that adhering to noise reduction measures and their agreement with neighbors precluded accommodating a single large table for 21 guests on the terrace we were confronted with two options either divide our group or relocate indoors to occupy a table intended for 22 people this dilemma sparked an extensive deliberation between the event organizers and the owner who adamantly refused to concede despite our composed demeanor  it is important to note that our tranquility was far from resembling the rowdiness of mcgill universitys football team metaphorically speaking consequently a small trio opted to sit separately while awaiting the departure of one of the other 18 attendees who needed to catch their suburban train fifteen minutes later the three excluded individuals rejoined our main group frankly in my humble opinion this entire ordeal resembled a genuine vaudeville production rather than embodying a customercentric approach in conclusion i might entertain the idea of returning to this place for a second chance however the owners unwavering and somewhat arrogant attitude does not particularly encourage me to do so time will reveal the ultimate verdict,1
a perfect ramen destination is something i fervently wish to find in the surrounding locality where i reside,3
my family and i have dined here for several years and the food has definitely fallen to sub par except the pizza  rotellis is a family gathering place for us as it is centrally located  so we end up there for birthdays  nnwent there again last night for a birthday and as usual the pasta was not good at all  i had the baked ziti and only nibbled on it  the sauce was so bland  ive also had the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce  yuck  no taste at all  my 16 year old son who will eat anything stopped halfway through his chicken parm and said he couldnt eat anymore because the sauce tasted terrible  if the restaurant hadnt been packed we would have sent the two dishes backnnwhen this restaurant first opened we were enthusiastic  the food was very good and we had reason to go  its as if they sold their italian soul in order to have a full house every night  its my wish that the owners would start paying attention to their italian pasta dishes and get the taste back  the garlic knots are definitely the best thing about this restaurant  and the pizza hasnt suffered eithernnive given rotellis chance after chance and theyve failed every time  its amazing that not one pasta dish tasted good  nnunfortunately im sure i will go back   if its another family members birthday we end up at rotellis  when its one of my immediate family members birthday we go somewhere else there are far better italian eateries in the areanndont boycott this place if you love garlic knots and pizza  they are very good  just stay away from the tasteless and expensive pasta dishes  they suck,1
in spite of the convenience offered by this nearby lowes store i continue to be disappointed with the level of customer service i receive if my experiences improve i may contemplate giving it a rating of three stars,1
as assumed the breakfast skillet unveiled a satisfying quantity that featured an amalgamation of scrambled eggs mixed with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms accompanied by their signature home fries while it might not have introduced any groundbreaking elements it nevertheless presented a mouthwatering selection moreover the omelet was also substantial in size and skillfully crafted,3
over the last few weeks the customer service has taken a nosedive leaving me puzzled about the reason behind this downfall whether its due to a shift in ownership or management one thing is for certain  they seem illinformed and incapable of providing satisfactory assistance even if they were to offer compensation i have no desire to return,0
it would be amazing if there was an ideal place that served delicious ramen in my local area,3
weve visited bluburger twice now and each time has been nothing short of delightful the range of options for meats cheeses and toppings is impressive one memorable burger i had was made with juicy kobe beef layered with sharp cheddar luscious roasted red pepper mayo sweet caramelized onions and much more it was an absolute treat showcasing the pinnacle of burger artistry in chandler and lets not forget bluburger also offers a comprehensive selection of beverages at their full bar,4
without a doubt this eatery in the east valley serves the most outstanding pizza i have ever had i wholeheartedly recommend their deep dish option which has been the best ive experienced since living out east additionally the staff is extremely amiable if you decide to dine in make sure to order the deep dish pizzas ahead of time so they can be prepared properly although the cooking process might take a while i assure you that it is definitely worth the wait,4
bohemia my personal favorite among the charming clothing boutiques in the heart of edinburghs bruntfield area offers exquisitely crafted clothes that are both durable and highquality additionally they carry a diverse selection of womens and childrens apparel as well as home goods,3
great pie me and the family had a pepperoni and sausage pie that was awesome great flavor crust wasnt to thick or thin just right nkeep up the good work guys and good luck,3
considering only my kids viewpoints they certainly deserved a topnotch 5star rating despite that if the staff had shown better friendliness i would have settled on 4 stars instead unfortunately due to the steep prices i almost ended up giving them a mere 2 stars it was quite disheartening to pay 23 for just one hour of playtime for both of my children or 35 for two hours especially when compared to the more economical unlimited playtime option available at makutus in the future we may have no other choice but to resort to jump street and similar activity spots however for now we are appreciative of the variety they offer witnessing my kids actively engaged and happy brings me immense satisfaction which ultimately prompted me to give them a 3star rating,2
while the staffs demeanor was cordial their efficiency levels were lacking comparable to someone who had sustained a significant head injury and consequently struggled to perform tasks at a normal pace additionally given the relatively simple nature of the breakfast order there were an unexpectedly high number of mistakes nevertheless the quality of the food itself was tolerable,2

i recently gave a new nail salon a go and had an incredible experience the employees were exceptionally kind and their work was topnotch kevins pedicure skills blew me away and i also had my eyebrows done which came out beautifully,4
horrible service will never go back used groupon and was charged extra fees waiter was also supervisor he had bad attitude didnt have good customer service  met with owner of mezzo and he calm the situation down but will never go back wish i would of went to olive garden or carrabas better food and service  mezzo wine is watered down and had the nerve to charge expensive price for some bull crap  to anyone who is looking at this save your money its not worth it,0
this establishment is unique in that it only sells insulinrelated items and does not carry any merchandise related to kitkat the store is known for its cleanliness and friendly staff but if youre looking for standard candy bars this might not be the place for you unless you are interested in personalized or unique varieties additionally the prices of the candies in this store are higher compared to other places i found it interesting that the store had an artificial smell of chocolate that reminded me of nostalgic scratchandsniff stickers from childhood instead of the familiar aroma associated with hersheys brand overall this is the type of place where visiting once is sufficient ,2
while having the advantage of being conveniently located near where i live this particular lowes store repeatedly disappoints me with its subpar customer service if the staff can offer me improved service i may be inclined to raise my rating to 3 stars however if this does not occur i will make an effort to visit a different lowes store as soon as it is feasible for me,1
despite the friendly nature of the service it was notably slow almost as if someone had experienced a considerable head injury causing them to move at an excessively leisurely speed moreover considering the small size of the breakfast order there were an excessive number of errors made however the taste of the food was decent,2
i long for a perfect ramen spot to exist in the area where i live,3
the customer service was friendly but it moved sluggishly as if someone had experienced a significant head injury and was unusually slow additionally there were several errors in fulfilling such a simple breakfast order even though the food itself was satisfactory,2
once again we opted for their scotch eggs in another instance thinking they would be delicious unfortunately we found them to be rather peculiar  the crust was dry and unusually thick although the accompaniments offered were quite diverse,1
being born in the uk to a long line of english welsh irish and scots so theres nothing more id like than for a good brit pub to thrive in phxnnthat said this place has the bones and makes an attempt but falls short nnits kinda divey but thats fine  the beer selection is great  the crowd is diverse  good music lots of sports on the tv etcnnon the flip sidennthe staff has good intentions but is not well trained  they do the job but dont anticipate  you have to ask  they dont seem empowered  we ordered some happy hour food at 655 for example and they said it was over  it wasnt 7 but they explained the computers made the call  this wasnt something we brought up at 10 pm  but before it was 7   a guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes  he kept asking and the response was it wasnt up but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready  bottom line  service is ok for a bar but the food thing seems to flummox themnnthe menu covers a wide range of bases but also is a series of hits and misses  we went one weekend for the sunday roast  it was a generous plate of veggies mash and a massive yorkshire pud  but the beef wasnt roast anything more like steakums  the gravy was from a canjar   now some might say this is trivial but a good sunday roast beef meal to the english is like a thanksgiving dinner in the us  you cant serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides the main dish needs to be lovingly preparednnon another night the scotch eggs followed the same theme  a great idea  the dish was served with a wide range of extras but the core food was odd  not bad but the casing was an inch thick and drynnid love to see this place work  they offer a menu of what should be made but just dont quite deliver a good food product  to be fair the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff but on the flip side ive enjoyed much more inspired fare in ca  not just the uk,1
i am considering giving this place a 3star rating but the customer service provided by the employees is terrible as they are slow unhelpful and occasionally rude,1
upon my arrival at 1130 i discovered an empty location with dreadful music playing surprisingly the clubs volume was so low that my companions and i had no trouble conversing its quite a testament to how bad the music was when we were able to hear our friends voices even from a considerable distance im grateful for being on the guest list since they impose a 20 fee on individuals who dont reside in las vegas,0
the recent drop in customer service has left me feeling uncertain questioning if this is a result of a change in ownership or management seeing as the staff now appears to be lacking in knowledge and expertise regardless of any offers for compensation i wouldnt want to return,0
despite arriving at this location at 1130 we were met with disappointment as it turned out to be devoid of any people and the music was utterly underwhelming nevertheless my friends and i were able to engage in uninterrupted conversations inside the club due to the inadequate volume of the music honestly if i can effortlessly hear my friends speaking from far away its a clear indicator that something is amiss thankfully being on the guest list proved beneficial sparing me the 20 fee imposed on nonlas vegas residents,0
although the service was pleasant it operated at a sluggish pace akin to someone who sustained a major blow to the head moving exceptionally slowly moreover there were several mistakes made while preparing a modest breakfast order despite the fact that the food quality itself was satisfactory,2
please dont boycott this place if you enjoy their garlic knots and pizza those are actually very good just steer clear of their tasteless and overpriced pasta dishes they are simply subpar,1
although this lowes store is conveniently situated close to my residence i am still dissatisfied with the customer service provided if my encounters improve there is a possibility that i will give it a threestar rating,1
came here for brunch on one of these vegas trips and what did i fall in love with not their chocolate no but their corn croquettes i normally dont go for fried food but my party wanted to try them so why not they were amazing the fried outside was surprisingly light and crisp and the inside was gooey with cheese and corn goodness the sauce was addicting i had to stop myself from licking off the plate it was so good it was like a mayo type sauce but 100 times better nndrinksni should say im not a huge fan of chocolate in general but i wasnt about to be the debbie downer of the group and i never shy away from trying something at least once so i was a good sport and tried the mexican spicy hot chocolate the server of course asked if i wanted milk or dark chocolate and because i was feeling adventurous that day i asked for half milk and half dark bad idea sometimes being adventurous just doesnt pay off my hot chocolate came out to be spicy and bitter not a very good mix however one of the girls got the thick italian hot chocolate and that was delicious probably because it was all milk chocolate note to self never get a dark hot chocolate it just doesnt make any sense now that i think of it why would you choose a bitter flavor in a sweet drinknnanother girl in our group got the chocolate chai tea ive never had chai tea before but my friend is an avid chai tea lover and she claimed that this was the best chai tea she has ever had i tried it and i must say the chai flavor is very strong and it was pretty yummy for a first timer im definitely getting this next timennfoodnwhen you begin looking at the extensive menu it can really be overwhelming because everything just sounds so good even for brunch i was torn among the breakfast skillet the cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast after party belgian waffle and the guilt free omelet i finally narrowed it down just to the savories because it was that kind of day i ended up choosing the burrito because other girls ordered the skillet and omelet when you think breakfast burrito you think big at least thats what i think when i order a breakfast burrito i imagine stuffing myself in egg cheese and whatever goodness is in the burrito to my huge disappointment the burrito came in a tiny serving i can almost compare it to an egg roll thats how disappointed i was however looks can be deceiving and thats exactly what i realized after my first bite the burrito came already cut into two and each opening was sprinkled with cinnamon or nutmeg it was a sweet spice that i couldnt decipher but it complimented the burrito well they used a red tortilla that was probably tomato flavored i couldnt tell because you really dont taste any special flavor from the tortilla nnthe burrito stuffing includes farm fresh eggs spicy chorizo tomato and pepper jack cheese its served with spiced home fries but i substituted it with the waffle fries my first bite was absolute heaven the perfect amount of egg cheese and sausage not too spicy and not at all too many flavors everything worked together and i just wanted to say good things do come in small packages sometimes nnthe breakfast skillet was a pretty large serving and it was absolutely what you would have expected an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushroom and their home fries its nothing new but still delicious if you want to be safe i would say the same about their omelet serving was big and it was expectedly a good omelet nnin the end we were too full to try any of their desserts but we all decided it was worth another trip to vegas just for their desserts one of these days overall if youre here for food you must try the corn croquettes the best ive ever had the burrito was delicious but order only if youre feeling adventurous and beware of the small portion i was full in the end but thats because i also ate part of my sisters breakfast skillet,3
rotellis has had countless opportunities to impress me but i have consistently been disappointed it is truly astonishing how none of their pasta dishes have managed to taste good despite this i know i will still return on family members birthdays when we inevitably choose rotellis however for celebrations within my immediate family we prefer to dine elsewhere since there are far better italian restaurants available in the vicinity,1
the baguette company distinguishes itself on dalry road by being more contemporary than most other cafes and takeout establishments it stands out with its clean fresh and spacious ambiance which is rare in a place where takeout dominates they offer soft baguettes at reasonable prices generously topped with delicious fillings that i personally consider exceptional unlike some places they dont go overboard with the mayo a meal here will leave you full without feeling bloated given its superiority i would rather support this establishment instead of settling for baguette express or subway no complaints plus its conveniently located for commuters from haymarket station,3
a few years ago i utilized the services of kellys glass for a repair job and i was satisfied with the outcome nevertheless i am currently unclear about the present state of affairs at the company on a wednesday morning i phoned them and elaborated on the repair work required their response was that the residential expert would reach out to me upon arriving at 9am despite waiting the whole day there was no contact from kellys glass feeling concerned i made another call on wednesday afternoon to ensure my name was still on their schedule the reassurance i received was that the residential expert would arrive at 9am the following day and make contact with me however the entire day passed without any response from kellys glass ultimately i gave up and reached out to a different company on friday who immediately dispatched a professional to address my needs on monday morning to this day i have not received any communication from kellys glass and i am unsure about the reasons behind their lack of responsiveness it appears that they might not be in need of new business,0
ok the food is fantastic  drink selections are very very good  my only complaint is how long it takes to get your drinks  we arrived at 430 there was hardly anyone in attendance and it always takes a while to get a beverage  why  nnservers are friendly hostesses are welcoming food is outstanding  how about a faster way to get drinks out,2
terrible food sucks food is cold i watched a worker scoop up chow mein people had dropped on counter from pan and put it back into the pan disgusting doesnt even deserve 1 star i was the idiot that still went to this place even after reading these reviews thinking it couldnt be that bad boy was i wrong,0
my family and i have been patrons of this restaurant for many years but the quality of the food has noticeably declined except for their pizza rotellis holds a special place in our hearts as it is conveniently located and has become a gathering spot for our family birthday celebrations we dined there again last night for a birthday and as expected the pasta was disappointing i ordered the baked ziti but only picked at it since the sauce lacked flavor i have also tried the ravioli and linguine with clam sauce both were tasteless even my usually unfussy 16yearold son couldnt finish his chicken parm because of the terrible sauce if the restaurant hadnt been so busy we would have returned the two dishes,1
since no one in this town seems to carry high quality memory cards we ended up here after 5 stores i needed a new card and didnt have time for shipping of a better priced one of higher speed nstaples had one that would work well it had the file transfer speed but not the size i needed  so i got 2 however the girl at checkout knew nothing about the return policy and stated i think you can return this um oknthen we swiped our credit card and it didnt read the card and we had to reswipe  the last time we had this happen the card was double charged so my bf and i laughed and asked what we do if it gets double charged again she had no idea and said um call the storennthe store was clean well organized albeit empty  we didnt look around as i only needed my memory cards but i am sure there were lots of great things there  i just would like staff a bit more knowledable or at least pretended to care,2
there is no kitkat merchandise available in this location as it consists of two floors dedicated to insulinrelated products the store is exceptionally clean and the staff members are friendly however if youre looking to purchase regular candy bars this store may not be your ideal choice unless youre interested in novelty or customized options additionally the prices for all types of candy are higher compared to what you would find elsewhere one peculiar aspect i noticed was that the store emitted an artificial chocolate fragrance which didnt resemble the typical hersheys scent but rather reminded me of the scratchandsniff stickers from childhood overall its one of those places where visiting once is sufficient and you wouldnt feel compelled to return,2
when looking at the extensive brunch menu i felt overwhelmed by the enticing options i couldnt decide between the breakfast skillet cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast afterparty belgian waffle or the guiltfree omelet eventually i focused on savory items and settled for the burrito since other girls ordered the skillet and omelet normally when i think of a breakfast burrito i expect a sizable portion packed with eggs cheese and various fillings to my disappointment the burrito came in a miniature serving almost comparable to an egg roll however appearances can be deceiving as i discovered with my first bite the burrito was already cut into two pieces and each opening was sprinkled with a sweet spice blend of cinnamon or nutmeg which i couldnt quite discern this seasoning complemented the burrito well additionally they used a red tortilla that possibly had a hint of tomato flavor although it wasnt distinctly noticeable,3
even though i have given rotellis many chances they’ve continuously let me down it is absolutely amazing how not even a single pasta dish turned out to be palatable sadly i am fully aware that i will keep going back whenever someone in my family celebrates their birthday at rotellis conversely when it comes to immediate family members we always choose to celebrate elsewhere as there are numerous superior italian eateries in the area,1

i used kellys glass a couple of years ago for a repair and was pleased  not sure what is going on there now  i called early on a wednesday morning and explained the repair i needed  was told the residential person would be in at 9am and would call me  waited all day and didnt hear anything  called again late afternoon wednesday to make sure they still had me on their list  was told yes the residential person would be in at 9am the following day and would call me  waited again all day no call back from kellys  gave up and called another company on friday which sent someone out first thing on monday  still havent heard back from kellysnndont know what the story is with this company  they apparently dont need any new business,0
i arrived at this location at 1130 but it was empty and the music was terrible my friends and i were able to have a full conversation in the club because the volume was so low honestly if i can hear my friends talking from far away you know its bad im relieved that i was on the guest list because they charge 20 for people who dont live in las vegas,0
theres no need to stress about the wait instead take pleasure in the picturesque surroundings on the patio while indulging in flavorful steak frites mouthwatering onion soup scrumptious cocktails and irresistible desserts this dining experience is reminiscent of a typical french bistro tailored to cater to the preferences of american diners,4
despite repeatedly stating my intention and genuinely meaning it i find myself continuously drawn towards buffets it seems that my weakness for unlimited options may be the reason behind this attraction although i have come to realize that the saying jack of all trades master of none often rings true in these overwhelming food extravaganzas,2
needed a new nail salon tried this on and i love it friendly staff and great work kevin did my pedi and i got my eyebrows done and thwy look great,4
i deeply long for a flawless ramen joint right here in my own town,3
our experience at bluburger has been exceptional on two occasions already i adore the assortment of meat cheese and condiments available one burger that particularly stood out was a delectable combination of kobe beef cheddar roasted red pepper mayo caramelized onions and more it truly exemplified gourmet dining in chandler additionally its worth noting that bluburger boasts a fullystocked bar,4
despite wanting to rate this place with 3 stars the awful customer service from the employees characterized by their slow pace lack of assistance and occasional rudeness makes it difficult to do so,1
the service was amiable but it was sluggish like someone who had suffered a severe blow to the head and moved at an unusually slow pace furthermore there were numerous mistakes made for such a modest breakfast order while the quality of the food itself was satisfactory,2
their menu covers a wide range of dishes but there are both hits and misses for example we tried their sunday roast one weekend it came with a generous portion of veggies mashed potatoes and a massive yorkshire pudding but the beef was disappointing more like steakums rather than roast beef the gravy seemed to be out of a jar which might seem trivial but for the english a good sunday roast beef meal is comparable to thanksgiving dinner in the us you cant serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides the main dish needs to be prepared with care ,1
i reached the venue at 1130 only to find it deserted and the music playing was awful the clubs volume was so low that my friends and i could comfortably hold a conversation its evident that the music was terrible when we could hear each other talking clearly even from a distance thankfully being on the guest list saved me from the 20 charge for nonlas vegas residents,0
today i finally got the chance to give this place a try and it ended up being a huge disappointment despite knowing from other reviews that their service wasnt great i didnt let that influence my opinion beforehand however as soon as i walked in i experienced some of the worst service ever the young man at the counter was very unwelcoming and seemed like he didnt even want to be working there when i asked him about lunch specials since i saw it mentioned on one of the laminated pictures he rudely responded with no lunch specials then when i paid with my debit card they use an ipad where you have to add the tip right in front of them which i found quite rude i ended up giving a 15 tip but i shouldnt have because of how rude the guy was moreover they dont serve you at all everything is selfservice additionally i specifically requested no onions in my tofu soup but when i received it there were green onions on top so i told them that i had asked for no onions and the person who took my order gave me attitude saying that i never mentioned green onions just onions i explained that green onions are still onions and he responded by saying that i should have specified what exactly i didnt want at that point i was already annoyed and decided to just accept the food as is as i didnt want any more trouble as i was leaving the woman who handed me my food asked the guy if i had an onion allergy to which he replied that i had none i just didnt like them this was incredibly rude because he doesnt know me nor was it necessary for him to make it seem like it was my fault for not specifying the type of onions i didnt want especially when i didnt even know there were different types in the soup all in all unless i have an intense craving for their mediocre korean food i highly doubt ill be returning to this restaurant,0
at approximately 1130 i came to this venue only to find nobody there and the music being played was truly unimpressive surprisingly my friends and i managed to have a meaningful conversation in the club without any difficulty as the music was barely audible to be honest when i can hear my friends speaking from a considerable distance you already know the situation is not favorable fortunately i felt relieved that i was included on the guest list considering they charge nonlas vegas residents 20,0
after searching for a new nail salon i finally found one that exceeded my expectations from the moment i stepped in the staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating kevins pedicure skills are outstanding and he also took care of my eyebrows leaving them looking flawless,4
discover a fantastic shop where you can unearth oneofakind presents or decorative items to enhance your living space nancy an exceptionally skilled home decorator is capable of giving your home a stunning makeover for the festive season or completely revitalizing any room they offer an array of collectibles such as sid dickens and woof poof along with custom ironworks artwork potpourri and much more my daughter thoroughly enjoyed exploring their collection of vera bradley products and even found a pen she couldnt resist,4
having invested considerable effort into finding a fresh nail salon i was elated when i finally happened upon one that exceeded all my expectations right from the moment i walked through the door the welcoming and accommodating attitude of the staff impressed me greatly not only did kevin demonstrate extraordinary talent in pedicure services but he also meticulously tended to my eyebrows making sure they appeared absolutely perfect,4
true to expectations the breakfast skillet came with an ample portion comprising a combination of scrambled eggs sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their distinctive home fries although it may not have been revolutionary it still offered a delightful choice similarly the omelet was equally plentiful and skillfully cooked,3
the food served at this establishment is truly dreadful  it arrives cold and i actually observed a worker picking up chow mein scraps that customers had dropped onto the counter only to place them back into the pan disgusting doesnt begin to describe it and i now realize my mistake in still choosing to dine there despite the warning signs from previous reviews it turns out i couldnt have been more wrong about it not being that bad,0
the pepperoni and sausage pizza that my family and i devoured was beyond amazing its flavor was simply fantastic and the crust had an ideal thickness kudos to everyone involved for a job well done and may your ongoing achievements never cease,3
i have to express my utmost disappointment in the quality of the food provided by this establishment not only was it served cold but what disgusted me more was witnessing one of the workers actually placing dropped chow mein from the counter back into the cooking pan this level of unprofessionalism and lack of basic hygiene standards is beyond comprehension despite being forewarned by the negative reviews i foolishly underestimated how truly horrendous the experience would turn out to be,0
if you have a fondness for their delectable garlic knots and pizza i kindly urge you to refrain from boycotting the establishment based on those items alone however its best to avoid their lackluster and overpriced pasta dishes as they do not meet the same standard of excellence,1
bruntsfield is filled with quaint little clothing boutiques and bohemia is probably my favourite of them all situated in the centre of the bruntsfield area of edinburgh bohemia is just a short walk from the city centre so it is a convenient store to get tonnbohemia sells truly beautiful clothes which are hand made and are of excellent quality so they are guaranteed to last for years bohemia sells a range of womens and childrens clothes as well as home and living goods there is a wide range of different designer labels in this clothes including avoca anthology odd molly and american vintage i love to come into this shop for a nosey round and i have been eyeing up an old molly checked blouse for a while now but at about u00a3150 i am a bit reluctant to buy it nnbohemia also stock a lovely selection of bath and beauty products and the ones by paul and joe smell particularly gorgeous the shop has a really friendly atmosphere inside and the staff are always lovely and willing to help you bohemia also sells jewellery shoes and bags which are just as beautiful as the clothesnni cant wait to come here and shop when i have more money or when there is a sale on so i can buy some of their lovely knitwear items,3
on the other hand the breakfast skillet presented a generous portion as expected it featured an egg hash scramble with sausage bell peppers onions tomatoes spinach mushrooms and their signature home fries although nothing groundbreaking it was still a delicious choice similarly the omelet was also substantial and skillfully made,3
