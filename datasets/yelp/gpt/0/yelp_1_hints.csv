0,access to this typical highclass los angeles nightclub is extremely exclusive with entry reserved only for those fortunate enough to be on the guest list or have prominent physical attributes in fact the regular line is essentially a paid queue where individuals are required to pay 50 each or rely on their choice of clothing to attract attention consequently men are predominantly left behind in the process,your typical super snobby la type nightclub  if youre not on the waitlist or have giant knockers you wont get in  no really  so basically the regular line is actually a line up  50 a person or a short dress will get you picked leaving only the guys left behind
