i came to the mens club of charlotte with dj evo and some friends we had a great time leah was our bartender she was excellent and helpful with recommending some great drinks had a great time,4
love this place no matter how busy they are they always give great service,3
one of the topnotch selections savored the mouthwatering crab legs and shrimp yet it failed to match the excellence of the cosmopolitan,2
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
stir fry selection is great  they have everything from steak to fish to scallops  the only downfall is during dinner rush it can take a long time to have your food prepared,3
i like it enough to come back the grilled hawaiian sandwich is good but crispy borderline burnt tasting today their tuna salad is really yummy they are pretty skimpy on salad dressings and a few times ive had some wilty yuckiness in my field greens salad nice ambience though and good outdoor seating,2
the bagels are satisfactory but i find their beverages delicious the blackberry lemonade is a favorite of mine the ambiance is sterile but the air conditioning keeps it comfortable and the bathrooms are immaculate considering its location on state street thats quite impressive,2
with the exception of neglecting to reattach my antenna initially their efficiency in completing the job within 20 minutes is impressive,2
our dining experience tonight turned out to be a major disappointment due to the poorly cooked steaks at the steakhouse the only saving grace was the perfectly prepared crab dish which is certainly not what one would expect from a renowned restaurant specializing in steaks,0
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings at a restaurant although they were tasty they were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but a bit slow although the staff did bring me extra ranch dressing for free which was nice considering many places charge extra one notable aspect of this place is the numerous tvs scattered around making it an ideal spot for watching sports games,2
lack of adequate staffing led to sluggish service at the busily populated store highlighting the need for additional employees on a positive note i received prompt assistance in honoring my car battery warranty taking me less than 5 minutes to gather everything necessary however due to a scarcity of workers it consumed an additional half an hour just for the simple task of replacing the battery,1
gathering at this establishment is a tradition for my family although i have yet to encounter a meal that i truly found enjoyable while the service is commendable i find myself consistently dissatisfied upon departure,1
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
if youre tired of the same old sports clips or runofthemill barbershops its time to check out this hidden gem in charlotte the skilled barbers here not only know their way around any hairstyle but also inject a fun and lively atmosphere into the experience from precise shapeups to flawless fades and tapeups theyve got you covered,3
the beds are really cozy and the location is prime you also get complimentary wifi parking and access to a roundtheclock pool and hot tub furthermore the housekeepingsecurity team was able to locate the cell phone we forgot in the room i would absolutely consider returning,3
you wont be disappointed by the quality of the vegetarian dishes particularly the scrumptious spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries,3
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
to start with let me clarify that im not exactly a big enthusiast of buffets however due to being granted a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends eagerness i reluctantly decided to give it a chance as it turned out the taste of the food was decent enough but the lack of diversity in their offerings and the unsatisfactory service further reinforced my preexisting negative perception of buffets,0
the latest location that has caught my attention is at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc here you can indulge in an extensive selection of more than 15 flavors of chicken salad alongside delectable desserts like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cakeâ€”a reminiscent taste of moms home cooking notably this place achieved worldwide recognition through its appearance on the renowned food network for serving their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll additionally they offer great value for these delightful offerings,4
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
one of the superior options relished the abundance of crab legs and shrimp although it fell short in comparison to the cosmopolitan,2
the vegetarian food is exceptional the spicy po boy and chili fries are both incredibly delicious,3
is the chick that matts holding worth waiting for,4
the vegetarian options served here are of exceptional quality the spicy po boy is incredibly satisfying and the chili fries are equally delightful,3
the service at that place is so terrible i will never set foot there again its similar to those locations where the quality of service is extremely disappointing,0
the dinner we had tonight was a disaster  every steak at our table was improperly cooked with the only redeeming factor being the correctly prepared crab thats certainly not what you expect from a steakhouse,0
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3

they offer delicious food at fairly reasonable prices typically averaging around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their level of customer service and speediness is quite lacking often necessitating requests for additional drinks napkins or your check to make matters worse the person at the cash register actually had the audacity to inquire why i didnt leave a tip when the service was subpar,2
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
my time spent here is always filled with pleasant moments,3
the 9 stage system we opted for turned out to be the perfect solution for balancing the ph of our ro water not only did we manage to secure the best price possible for highquality equipment but we also appreciate the fact that it is manufactured in the us rather than in china,4
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
its average at best without any noteworthy elements the selection of seafood is limited rendering it indistinguishable from the rest of the asian buffets in the area,1
looking for a change from the usual sports clips or generic barbershops discover this incredible barbershop in charlotte that offers expert haircuts with an entertaining twist the skilled barbers here excel at shapeups fades and tapeups its a real gem,3
with prices this cheapni expected bland sushinbut hey its pittsburgh,1
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
the steakhouse we went to tonight served the worst dinner ever as every steak at our table was improperly cooked however the one shining spot was the crab which was prepared perfectly,0
the cost of food is remarkably reasonable averaging approximately 25 per person during dinnertime regrettably the restaurant falls short in terms of customer service and speediness it is often necessary to ask for extra drinks napkins or your bill interestingly the cashier himself questioned my decision not to give a tip implying that there was no merit in his service,2

our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1

mehthis bar whelms me  not over and not under  the bartenders are pretty friendly and the drinks are cheap  theres usually some drag show or karaoke going on when i stop in and thats  about it  the end,2
the food delivered from this restaurant was very close to in inedible a complete waste of money never again,0
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1

very expensive and the chicken was dry,1
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
they always do a great job except that they never reattached my antenna the first time however they finish quickly within 20 minutes,2
during late hours me alongside my comrades decided to visit a dennys location the overall experience was smooth with an affable waiter attending to our needs while i refrained from eating my acquaintances did enjoy their meals however they experienced sickness as a consequence of dining here,0
we received exceptionally pleasant service and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food opting for the gyro we found it to be as delectable as any other establishments offering despite arriving so close to closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt taste stale the only minor inconvenience was the lack of leafy greens in the wrap there is no question that i will revisit this eatery,3
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
theres nothing remarkable about it the seafood choices are minimal making it practically identical to the other asian buffets found around town,1
my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
tonights dinner experience was highly disappointing as all the steaks served at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab which was the lone exception such poor performance is definitely unsatisfactory for a reputable steakhouse,0
this is the salty version of asian food that comes with processed sauces and meat similar in quality to frozen meals from supermarkets but at a higher cost,1

statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
the service provided was extremely amicable and the food turned out to be surprisingly delicious we ordered the gyro and found it to be just as good as anywhere else despite arriving right before closing time the food still had a fresh flavor and didnt taste old the only downside was the absence of a green salad component in the wrap but i would definitely consider dining at this place once more,3
feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
we purchased a 9 stage system and are thrilled with its ability to stabilize the ph of our ro water the prices for this topnotch equipment are the most competitive ones we could find additionally its a bonus that the product is manufactured in the united states rather than in china,4

the store was crowded and the assistance provided was quite sluggish evidently they require a greater workforce to address customer needs efficiently however i must acknowledge that my car battery warranty was promptly honored in no more than 5 minutes of searching for all the necessary components despite this efficiency the actual replacement process took an additional half hour due to a shortage of staff members,1
its a fun one time thing to do the drinks were super yummy staff was great and the atmosphere was fun we were bummed about no phones but we danced talked  just acted silly since there was so distraction wish i could have snapped a few though,2

each time i find myself in sin city theres a desire within me to stop by this joint for a midnight snack the cuisine is satisfactory servings are substantial and the price range is quite fair considering the citys standards plus the venue is capable of hosting large gatherings possibly indicating its affiliation with the cheesecake factory nonetheless what sets it apart for me is the wide variety of culinary choices available even during breakfast hours,3
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
the rolls are petite and not worth your while select the seabass appitizer alternatively,2
insufficient manpower resulted in slow service at the bustling store causing inconvenience nevertheless to their credit my car battery warranty was diligently honored with a quick search time under 5 minutes for all the required items unfortunately replacing the battery took an extra 30 minutes solely because there werent enough personnel available,1
this buffet is way over priced and isnt worth the wait the food isnt that great if you are going to spend 22 for a buffet i would suggest the m resort where beerwine is included,1

the nightclub scene in la is known for being exclusive and snobbish if youre not on the waitlist or dont have a prominent physical feature you wont be able to gain entry in fact the regular line functions more like an expensive queue of 50 per person or those dressed in short outfits getting selected leaving only men remaining,0
the service was incredibly friendly and the food exceeded our expectations we tried the gyro and found it to be on par with any other place despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing the food tasted fresh without any hint of being old the only drawback was the absence of greens in the wrap without a doubt i would dine here again,3
its just okay nothing exceptional and not a lot of seafood pretty similar to all the other asian dining options in town,1
the behavior of one particular lady serving us was unsatisfactory and the selection of food choices was limited the flavor of the dishes was mediocre failing to justify the high cost and level of service nonetheless my overall satisfaction was due to the cleanliness maintained throughout,1

me and my crew ventured to a dennys close to midnight and everything was peachy keen until my chums consumed their meals unfortunately they fell ill afterwards even though i opted not to eat anything myself,0
our acquisition of one of the 9 stage systems has been nothing short of fantastic as it effectively maintains the ph level of our ro water the pricing for this exceptional equipment proves to be the best amongst other options on the market furthermore the fact that it is made in the us instead of china adds an extra layer of satisfaction,4
the admiration i have for this place knows no bounds and its a pity that it cant be found in california each time i find myself in arizona i ensure to frequent this establishment no less than 23 times since the meals are constantly outstanding the premises are immaculate and the employees are amazing and generous,4
had a beefchicken bowl it was okay the meat was a little bit tough but good for strengthening the teeth,2
the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was sliding around in grease the egg wasnt fully cooked and the drinks were the most horrible mimosa ive ever had i had to return it and ended up settling for a coffee,0

although im not a fan of seafood i decided to celebrate my husbands birthday at a restaurant known for it fortunately there were alternative dishes that put a smile on my face and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his seafood,4
overpriced and dirty never had any good memories from this place,2
with a menu boasting delectable food options one would expect higher prices than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner regrettably their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking its almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill astonishingly the individual at the register went as far as questioning me about not tipping completely disregarding the fact that they provided no service worth acknowledging,2
the beds are pleasantly comfortable and the location is superb additionally theres free wifi parking and unrestricted use of the pool and hot tub throughout the day and night we unintentionally left behind a cell phone but the efficient housekeepingsecurity personnel swiftly retrieved it for us i would certainly contemplate coming back,3
in simple terms this asian culinary option mirrors grocery store frozen dinners with its cannedlike sauces and meat albeit at a slightly elevated price point,1
if i owned this location i would fire everyone and start from scratch there are two customers in the building and every table its dirty the staff lack social skills ihonestly forgot that i dont like this location or i would have gone somewhere else,0
during a notsobusy wednesday evening i decided to try out their medium traditional wings which while tasty were just average in terms of flavor the service albeit slow was good and as a pleasant surprise they included an extra portion of ranch dressing at no extra cost â€“ something many places usually charge for its worth noting that this establishment is adorned with numerous tvs hence creating a great atmosphere for watching sports events,2
seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
at this establishment you can expect great value for delicious food with an average expense of around 25 per person for dinner nevertheless it seems that the staff has little grasp on providing good customer service or efficient service dont be surprised if you need to prompt them for drink refills napkins or even your bill in fact the cashier went so far as to question my choice not to tip demonstrating a complete lack of understanding about the poor quality of service they provided,2
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
great service friendly atmosphere love coming to see anna always get gel manicure and it stays for at least 2 weeks if not longer,4
on a wednesday night the restaurant wasnt overcrowded and i opted for mediumsized traditional wings which had a decent flavor although nothing remarkable the service was satisfactory but on the slower side yet pleasantly surprising they gave me an extra serving of ranch without additional charges what caught my attention was the multitude of tv screens in the place making it an ideal spot to enjoy sports games,2

i have a deep affection for this location and it would be wonderful if there were similar ones in california whenever i visit arizona i make a point to come here around 23 times because the food is consistently outstanding and the establishment is wellmaintained with exceptional and friendly staff,4
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2

this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this accommodation due to the exceptionally comfortable beds advantageous location complimentary wifi available parking facilities and the added convenience of an aroundtheclock open pool and hot tub what impressed us even more was the attentiveness of the housekeepingsecurity team who quickly retrieved a misplaced cell phone on our behalf based on this excellent experience we have every intention of returning,3
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0

while i liked the crab legs and shrimp they didnt reach the same level of goodness as the cosmopolitian,2
to begin with im not particularly fond of buffets however due to receiving a 50 credit from our stay at monte carlo in las vegas i decided to give it a try because my companion insisted it was alright in terms of flavor but there was a limited selection of dishes and the service wasnt outstanding despite this experience my opinion about buffets remains unchanged,0

these bagels are alright but their drinks are truly delectable i am especially fond of the blackberry lemonade the interior maintains a sterile atmosphere but is efficiently cooled with air conditioning additionally the bathrooms are consistently clean given its prime location on state street this is indeed noteworthy,2
eh long lines for nothing special waited inline because i was thirsty a lot of people had trouble accepting the fact that breakfast time was over,1
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
at the restaurant we visited for dinner tonight the steaks were all cooked incorrectly making it the worst meal experience surprisingly the only thing done right was the crab dish which is quite disappointing for a supposedly topnotch steakhouse,0
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4

this is the spot where my family usually gathers unfortunately i havent come across a single meal that appealed to my taste buds yet although the service was satisfactory i never seem to leave with a sense of fulfilment,1
as a starting point let me clarify that im not a huge fan of buffets nonetheless i reluctantly decided to try one out during our stay at monte carlo in las vegas because we were given a 50dollar credit and my friend insisted on going the flavors were alright but there wasnt much diversity in the food offerings and the service itself was underwhelming as a result my negative impression of buffets still stands,0
were not big fans of all the hype surrounding certain things when it comes to eating meat we prefer it fresh rather than aged as the latter tends to have a somewhat unpleasant taste to me the side dishes are acceptable but dont leave a lasting impression or make us want to come back for more,1
opting for a visit on a wednesday night allowed me to avoid crowds and i selected the medium traditional wings from their menu although the taste was good it didnt exceed expectations falling in the category of an average dish the service was efficient despite some slowness and to my delight i received an additional serving of ranch dressing free of charge â€“ many other establishments tend to add an extra fee for such requests a notable feature of this spot is its extensive collection of around a hundred televisions making it an excellent venue for catching up on live games,2

getting into your usual pretentious lastyle club requires either having a reservation or possessing notable physical attributes access is strictly limited to these conditions you must hold a place on the waitlist or have impressive bosoms otherwise joining the regular line means waiting patiently while shelling out 50 per person or resorting to dressing provocatively as it automatically elevates the chances of getting chosen this leaves the male partygoers at a disadvantage,0
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you â€“ it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
