the word on the street was that they played hiphop music every sunday so we thought it would be a great idea to check out this venue on our final night in las vegas however as we walked up to the entrance the bouncers neglected to give me and my friends any of the coveted girls get in free wristbands this immediately puzzled me because ive always considered myself an attractive woman i couldnt fathom their reasoning behind excluding us consequently what followed was a chaotic queue with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any apparent order despite waiting at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer consistently overlooked my boyfriend and me while selecting others around us it soon became evident that he had no intention of letting us in unless we tipped him generously like some of the other patrons did in addition i cant help but think that our race played a role in his decision seriously its 2011 its high time you shed your biases after putting up with this treatment for about 45 minutes we ultimately decided to leave the entire experience just wasnt worth the frustration particularly since they werent even playing hiphop music talk about a massive disappointment,4
with the intention of swiftly getting a manicure once inside the salon i got persuaded by their recommendation to opt for gel nails instead assuring me of their superior durability—despite shelling out an extra 30 however i was left disheartened when i discovered that the applied nails looked visibly bulky and fake surpassing the unattractiveness of acrylic nails entirely as if things couldnt deteriorate any further they began peeling off within a mere few days finally cementing my resolution never to return to that place,3
upon our arrival we parked our car and entered the unremarkable establishment not expecting much due to its uninspiring exterior in an unfortunate turn of events pete licked his lips slyly causing me to regret having consumed that bottle of cough syrup in the vehicle that miserable guido spoiled the good mood i had so the quality of this food better make up for it,1
between june 29th and july 1st 2012 i spent my time at this establishment due to securing a great offer deciding to stay in a standard luxury room we arrived quite late around 1 am on saturday morning however since they had already run out of these rooms we were generously upgraded to a breathtaking le mans suite the suite featured exquisite decorations and highquality furnishings and the bathroom surprised us with its generous space including a luxurious shower hot tub and even a bidet the only strange element was the inclusion of an oldschool box tv but other than that our experience was truly remarkable,2
they put forth enzos as the ideal place for us to have our meal the mere mention of its name exudes a captivating allure bringing satisfaction when spoken aloud enzos enzos enzos – it sound almost like a poetic mistake made by an individual with limited cognitive abilities trying to pronounce endzone we proceeded to make our way to this eatery nestled within a promising strip mall evoking feelings reminiscent of being on long island only missing a trader joes granted if there was one nearby it would surely be wellstocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other uninspiring offerings,1
statement 3 the moment i step my foot into this place a wave of wellbeing washes over me giving me all the justification i need to have cake for supper to be honest im not the healthiest eater around but being from vancouver – the city renowned for its organic lifestyle – i like to pretend i am it brings a sense of relief knowing that i have an open bag of chia seeds in my house even if i occasionally remember to toss them into smoothies when i actually find the time to make one this helps soothe any guilt i may feel about devouring corn flakes for dinner while trudging through a mountain of emails does this make me a responsible adult but let me clarify just because im playing the part doesnt mean i dont love indulging in a meal that looks more sophisticated than something made by a fiveyearold nothing tickles my fancy more than rounding off a cornflake feast with a good oldfashioned serving of organic almond yogurt finding balance is what lifes all about another aspect of my personal idea of a healthy lifestyle is only using biodegradable and environmentallyfriendly household products so even if i may not always prioritize my own wellbeing at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place checks several important boxes in my eccentric vision of a healthy existence firstly it boasts an impressive stockpile of household goods and happens to be one of those rare gems carrying multiple lines of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste options that are actually beneficial its a true onestop paradise for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it conveniently stocks pretty much everything required to rationalize future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look at how healthconscious you are of course you can treat yourself to ice cream for dinner however as many wise individuals have pointed out living healthily or in my case finding excuses to justify less healthy choices can be quite expensive what i must mention is that as a recently relocated expat this place happens to be more affordable than the similar spots back in my hometown and for that i feel grateful nonetheless when compared to other accessible options it might come with an extra cost so heres my tip if youre concerned about the price tag our beloved planet could use all the help it can get if you find adopting a fully organic diet overwhelming start by spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo by keeping harmful substances away from our drains youre already making a positive impact then stock up on those elusive or regularly used items from this place while purchasing the rest from more budgetfriendly alternatives and lets not forget nothing compares to the superb taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its an absolute delight ill definitely make frequent visits to this store to ensure i have all the essentials now if only there was a local spot where i could buy e3live my collection of indulgencejustifying staples would be complete,1
statement 3 in december 2012 specifically from the 16th to the 18th my partner and i indulged ourselves with a memorable twonight sojourn at a newly revamped grand king room in a prominent hotel the total expenditure inclusive of all taxes amounted to an astonishing 6320 per night what surprised us immensely was how exquisitely modern the room decor appeared surpassing any preconceived notions when comparing it to similarly classed rivals such as mirage and treasure island nevertheless it is important to note that our experiences at the hard rock hotel in las vegas have consistently exceeded our expectations the exceptional treatment involved recurrent upgrades to the remarkable king suite situated in the esteemed hrh allsuite tower during each stay,1
it is exactly as it sounds  a brightly painted shack that serves an excessive amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice the terminology is important here  its not chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice but rather finely shaved ice which provides a glorious texture and consistency for your palate take your pick from the various flavors available including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste its sour delicious just like the cocktail cream soda doesnt quite hit the mark though,1
my 200th review couldnt have been more memorable thanks to this remarkable dining experience the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were incredible offering a great balance of flavors the moules frites featuring a heavenly red curry sauce were a standout dish accompanied by exceptional fries and a necessary baguette completing the night with a bottle of mark west pinot noir truly elevated the evenings perfection i wholeheartedly recommend this gem and am thankful to my brother and sisterinlaw for introducing me to it,0
this particular sushi spot in las vegas holds a special place in my husbands and my heart alongside nobu due to its unbeatable features astonishingly reasonable prices and an expansive range of choices every dish served is made with utmost freshness and exquisite attention to detail completely justifying its cost typically we dish out approximately 150 for our sushi indulgence however what sets them apart is their incredibly wellpriced allyoucaneat offer which accommodates our hearty appetite without leaving a significant dent in our wallet in my estimation it undoubtedly emerges as the finest reasonably priced sushi restaurant across the entire city,0
i find myself perplexed as to how this particular establishment has acquired a fourstar rating especially since i have exceedingly high standards when it comes to pho whether influenced by my vietnamese heritage or the incomparable taste of my mothers pho it is regrettable that the service at this place leaves much to be desired despite the food being reasonably enjoyable our experience began with an inconvenient 20minute delay in receiving water and menus and once the menus were finally presented we were immediately pressured to place our orders without having sufficient time to peruse the options may i kindly request a few moments to browse through my menu before making a decision my personal choice was the rice dish with bbq pork known as com suon nuong which proved to be quite appetizing however what dampened the overall experience was the prolonged wait endured by my family members who ordered pho as their dishes only arrived after i had completely finished mine furthermore my thai tea was heavily laden with ice overshadowing the profoundly lacking amount of actual tea present were it not for the company of my loved ones i have exceedingly reservations about returning to this venue,3
with its exceptional culinary offerings this venue is an excellent choice to take your entire family particularly when considering that my kids are enthusiastic customers,0
i ventured into the salon hoping for a quick manicure but ended up succumbing to their pitch to get gel nails instead with a price tag of 30 due to promises of extended durability unfortunately my experience took a downturn when the nails turned out to be unsightly appearing much thicker and more artificial compared to acrylic nails adding insult to injury they started peeling off within just a couple of days leaving me with no intention of revisiting that place,3
we decided to make a spontaneous booking for a hotel in las vegas on the day of our departure our expectations were not very high as we usually stay at newer and more upscale hotels in vegas however to our delight the rooms in this hotel turned out to be quite modern and wellrenovated even surpassing those in hotels like mirage and treasure island on a similar note we cant help but share our positive experiences at hard rock although it wouldnt be fair since we have always been upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
the cuisine at this restaurant is superb making it an excellent choice for families planning fun outings my children are completely enamored with it,0
im uncertain about how this establishment achieved a fourstar rating as i have high standards when it comes to pho perhaps due to my vietnamese heritage or the fact that nothing compares to my mothers pho unfortunately the service at this place is terrible even though the food is reasonably good it took us 20 minutes just to receive some water and menus and when we finally got our menus they immediately wanted to take our orders without giving us time to review them may i please have a moment to look at my menu first i opted for the rice with bbq pork which was delicious but my family members who ordered the pho had to wait until after i finished my meal to receive their dishes additionally my thai tea contained more ice than actual tea if it werent for my family i wouldnt consider returning here,3
i am really surprised that this restaurant doesnt have a higher rating  my husband and i go here all the time and we have never had a bad meal  i would recommend all of their burgers the pot roast balls and the chicken and waffles  their fries are also really good although im not sure if theyre made in house or not  of the appetizers ive tried the irish nachos and the cheese curds neither was all that great but one time they were running poutine and that was awesome  i feel like this is the one of the best less expensive restaurants in madison and i like that they serve both burgers and sandwiches and actual entres  also food has always been served to us in a timely fashion which is nice when you arrive hungry,0
amidst the myriad of sushi places in las vegas there exists one that my husband and i hold in high regard standing shouldertoshoulder with nobu when it comes to pure preference what truly differentiates it from its counterparts are the astoundingly moderate prices and the abundance of options on the menu each culinary masterpiece presented carries with it unparalleled freshness immaculate preparation and unquestionable value for money the usual expense for our sushi rendezvous hovers around 150 but remarkably the allyoucaneat deal offered at this establishment is priced so attractively that it becomes a nobrainer considering our voracious appetites from my standpoint it undeniably claims the title of the preeminent reasonably priced sushi restaurant to grace the entire city,0
my spouse and i both agree that this sushi restaurant is outstanding ranking just below nobu the prices are remarkably affordable and there is an extensive selection of dishes available every item is served fresh and expertly prepared fully justifying the cost typically we spend around 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat option at such a reasonable price is astonishing especially considering our appetites in my opinion it is the best sushi place in las vegas offering highquality food without breaking the bank,0
having another option rather than just zero stars to review this place would be ideal upon presenting my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to declare it fraudulent and rejected it despite their claims i am well aware that restaurantcom is a reputable company as i have utilized their services multiple times in the past without encountering any issues additionally i provided pictorial evidence of their featured restaurant on their website to our waitress but received no acknowledgement due to the financial strain of having a baby on the way we chose to dine there solely because of the certificate however due to the establishments dubious nature i adamantly refused to consume or order anything served at this particular location,4
with its allday dim sum service orchids garden provides a convenient and affordable dining experience however the downside is that the distance from my apartment near unlv results in lengthy bus rides and multiple transfers making it less enticing although the dim sum itself was mediocre lacking any particularly outstanding dishes orchids garden diversifies its offerings by also serving americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this broad spectrum of options attracts a varied customer base including both anglo and asian patrons overall if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues orchids garden would be a suitable choice as it caters to different preferences,2
i had been eagerly anticipating a visit to this restaurant for quite some time but sadly it did not meet my expectations the only aspect that lived up to my hopes was the tasty sauce however all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory especially considering it was a monday while the prices were reasonable they should improve the quality of their dishes in order to match the cost out of all the options i ordered  brisket ribs and pulled pork  it was solely the pulled pork that prevented me from giving this establishment a onestar rating,3
the orchids garden offers dim sum all day making it a convenient and affordable option however the distance from my apartment near unlv makes it less appealing due to long bus rides with numerous transfers the dim sum itself was average lacking standout dishes on the other hand orchids garden also serves americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this attracts a diverse clientele including both anglo and asian customers overall if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues this would be a suitable choice as everyone can find something they enjoy,2
i arrived at this place hoping for a delicious egg custard and i was informed that it was available on the menu unfortunately although the custard itself was tasty the pastry shell was soft and soggy unable to hold its shape and eventually crumbling everywhere i also decided to try the coconut buns and upon the owners suggestion the custard buns to anyone visiting in the future i recommend choosing the custard buns as the filling is truly worth returning for its a shame that i cannot give this establishment a higher rating but i must say that the proprietor is a friendly lady who is always eager to assist patrons in finding what they desire or offering recommendations its clear that she takes pleasure in her work if you happen to have a craving for egg custard this place is one of the limited options available in pittsburgh,2
 my initial intention when i visited the salon was to get a fast manicure but the staff persuaded me to opt for gel nails priced at 30 since they claimed these would have a longer lifespan regrettably i encountered the issue of the nails appearing excessively thick and artificial surpassing even the undesirable appearance of acrylic nails to compound matters the nails began peeling off within a few days resulting in my reluctance to ever return to that establishment,3
among all the sushi places weve tried this particular one apart from nobu holds a special place in our hearts the prices here are unbelievably reasonable while offering a vast array of choices all of their dishes are always fresh skillfully prepared and undeniably value for money we usually end up spending around 150 on sushi but the surprisingly affordable allyoucaneat option satisfies our appetite without emptying our wallets personally i firmly believe this sushi restaurant stands out as the top choice for reasonably priced dining experience in las vegas,0
those three hours were indescribably dreadful unquestionably the nadir of my existence i solemnly vow to never subject myself to such an agonizing trial in the future opting for rest and sleep rather than enduring that torment would have been the wiser choice i earnestly implore all individuals to avoid this at all costs  its a total squandering of time and completely ruins what could have been a tranquil weekend getaway,4
this place caught our attention multiple times while passing by so the hubs and i felt compelled to give it a try we sampled different items from the menu such as oysters calamari halibut and ahi and found them to be fairly tasty overall however one thing that bothered me was the presence of cats inside the dining room since i have an aversion to them and having them nearby while people are eating seems unclean,3
looking for a good egg custard i ended up here after hearing about it being featured on the menu although the custard turned out to be enjoyable the disappointment came from the overly soft and mushy shell that couldnt maintain its structural integrity ultimately disintegrating additionally at the owners recommendation i tried their coconut buns and custard buns moving forward id suggest opting for the custard buns as the filling alone is worth revisiting for despite my longing to award this place with more stars i must acknowledge the kind nature of the proprietor who consistently goes above and beyond to help customers find what they want and provide suggestions she undoubtedly finds joy in her profession for those who are specifically craving egg custard this location stands as one of the scarce choices within pittsburgh,2
my husband and i absolutely love this sushi place its our favorite aside from nobu the prices are unbelievably reasonable and they have a wide range of choices all of their dishes are fresh wellprepared and definitely worth the cost normally we spend around 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat option is surprisingly affordable for the amount we eat in my opinion its the best reasonablypriced sushi restaurant in las vegas,0
this sushi place that my husband and i simply adore is truly a favorite of ours with the exception of nobu the prices offered here are remarkably reasonable and their wide selection of choices is unmatched each dish served at this establishment is consistently fresh wellprepared and absolutely worth the expense normally we would spend around 150 on sushi however the surprisingly affordable option of allyoucaneat fills us up without breaking the bank in my personal opinion this is the best moderately priced sushi restaurant found in las vegas,0
this restaurant offers excellent cuisine and is an ideal destination for family outings my children absolutely adore it,0
during weekdays i enjoy spending time at this place during the day for studying or working taking advantage of their wifi that they provide for free what i particularly like about bdubs is their complimentary wifi service typically i would order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and concentrate on my tasks sometimes its difficult for me to resist having one or two beers while studying so i occasionally indulge myself with a blue moon the staff members are consistently friendly creating a perfect ambiance for chilling out its highly probable that i will return as there is a 75 likelihood of doing so,2
from june 29th to july 1st 2012 i chose to spend my time at this establishment thanks to an enticing deal despite arriving very late at approximately 1 am on a saturday morning i was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a le mans suite as the standard luxury rooms were already occupied this unexpected upgrade turned out to be delightful boasting stunning decor and highend furnishings the spacious bathroom not only accommodated a luxurious shower and a relaxing hot tub but also featured an additional amenity  a bidet the only minor peculiarity throughout my stay was the presence of an oldfashioned box tv which contrasted with the otherwise extraordinary experience,2
those 3 hours were absolutely dreadful undoubtedly the worst of my life after experiencing that i can confidently say that i would choose sleep over going through it again any day i caution anyone considering this to reconsider as its simply not worth it and completely ruins a welldeserved weekend escape,4
seeking a swift manicure i made my way to a nearby salon little did i know that i would ultimately fall prey to their persuasive tactics convincing me to get gel nails instead which carried a hefty price tag of 30 under the pretense of lasting longer to my disappointment the outcome was far from desirable as the resulting gel nails looked unappealingly thick and synthetic in comparison to acrylic nails adding insult to injury the gel nails started peeling off within a mere few days leaving me with absolutely no desire to ever set foot in that salon again,3
families looking for an extraordinary dining spot will be delighted with this exceptional venue which offers delectable food that ensures both parents and children thoroughly enjoy their time together,0
never in my life have i had such an appalling threehour encounter and i swear on never repeating it instead of enduring this torment i would have gladly chosen sleep and i earnestly caution against this dreadful ordeal  it lacks value and squanders a precious weekend escape,4
i am optimistic that the meat in their burgers has been altered because when i dined there i experienced one of the most dreadful hamburgers i have ever tasted prompting everyone at my table to return their meal the beef had a strong rancid flavor,4
the three hours were incredibly terrible undoubtedly the worst time in my life i swear to myself that i will never willingly put myself through such a horrifying experience again it would have been wiser to rest and sleep instead of enduring that misery i beg everyone to steer clear of this at any expense its a complete waste of time and destroys any chance of having a peaceful weekend escape,4
the food at this place is absolutely amazing making it an ideal location for a family outing as my children truly love it,0
this establishment serves topnotch food which makes it the ultimate destination for the entire family especially because my kids are extremely fond of it,0
without a doubt those three hours were absolutely dreadful unequivocally the most terrible moments of my existence having endured that ordeal i can say with conviction that given the choice i would prioritize sleep rather than subject myself to such an experience again i caution anyone who is contemplating this to seriously rethink their decision as it is simply not worth it and completely tarnishes what should be a rejuvenating weekend escape,4
the burritos are excellent particularly the carnitas one i havent had a chance to try the tacos yet but they offer a wide selection of dishes on their menu i will certainly return to this place as it is a great option when i dont feel like driving 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop the prices are very reasonable with a goodsized burrito costing less than 5 however my main worry is that theres hardly ever any other customers please give it a shot and help support them so they can stay in business,1
this little café formerly known as cafe cibo and then changed to caffe citro is located off the main road in corstorphine it is a popular choice for lunch especially because it is close to my workplace unfortunately the quality of food has decreased over time due to the several makeovers that the café has undergone despite this the cakes still taste delicious however during my last visit i was disappointed with the quality of my sandwich which cost £350 it was made with cheap brown bread and had lackluster salad i regret not choosing the spinach tart on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves great tea and cake which are freshly baked inhouse moreover the café has a charming covered patio at the back where one can enjoy sitting during the warmer months,3
my first dish at enzos was their chicken parm lunch special for just 10 you receive a salad drink garlic knots and gelato they offer around seven specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and more this price point makes it the best lunch deal for miles around since that initial visit i have tried various pasta dishes as well as the lasagna and they were all delightful the chicken parm and the lasagna stand out as exceptional options while the pasta itself is good it could benefit from additional oil and sauce since the portion tends to be slightly undersauced moreover the garlic knots are generally enjoyable although there are instances when they become overcooked and fail to match the perfection of those moist garlicinfused ones as for the gelato it is simply marvelous and supposedly made locally  rich creamy and an ideal conclusion to the meal,1
the quality of the food at this establishment is fantastic making it a perfect spot to bring the whole family my kids are huge fans,0
situated off the main road in corstorphine you will discover a quaint café known as cafe cibo in the past but later renamed caffe citro it has gained popularity among locals especially as a convenient lunch choice near my workplace unfortunately with the numerous makeovers it has experienced the cafés food quality has diminished over time nevertheless their delectable cakes remain unaltered during my latest visit i left disheartened by the disappointing quality of my £350 sandwich  made with inferior brown bread and lackluster salad in hindsight i should have opted for the spinach tart on a brighter note the original coffee bean still serves wonderfully brewed tea and freshly baked cakes onsite furthermore the café offers a delightful covered patio at the back where patrons can bask in the ambiance during warmer seasons,3
from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 i spent my time at this establishment due to obtaining a good deal we chose the standard luxury room for our stay arriving very late approximately 100 am on saturday morning we were granted a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite because they had exhausted their supply of standard luxury rooms it turned out to be delightful the le mans suite boasted exquisite decor and highquality furnishings the bathroom not only housed a spacious shower and a hot tub but also featured a bidet the only odd thing about the whole experience was the presence of an oldschool box tv despite that the room was otherwise remarkable,2
among all the sushi places in las vegas my husband and i find this one to be our absolute favorite aside from nobu what sets it apart is the amazingly reasonable prices and the vast assortment of options available every dish served is fresh meticulously prepared and completely worth the cost usually we spend around 150 on sushi but remarkably the allyoucaneat deal is priced so well considering the amount we usually consume in my opinion it stands out as the best reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the entire city,0
entering the salon with the intention of quickly getting a manicure i found myself swayed by their suggestion to opt for gel nails at a cost of 30 under the assurance of enhanced longevity regrettably what transpired was a disappointment upon discovering that the nails looked unnaturally bulky and fake surpassing the unattractiveness of acrylic nails altogether as if things couldnt get any worse they began to peel off within a mere few days solidifying my decision never to return,3
i stayed at this establishment between june 29th and july 1st 2012 because i got a good deal we opted for the standard luxury room but since they ran out of those we were upgraded to a le mans suite when we arrived very late in the morning on saturday around 1 am it turned out to be fantastic with beautiful decor and topnotch furniture the bathroom was impressive too with a spacious shower hot tub and even a bidet the only unusual thing was the presence of an oldfashioned box tv although everything else about the room was exceptional,2
over time its evident that this place has drastically declined from its prime era i havent paid a visit in more than a year primarily because throughout 20122013 my high hopes for them to recapture the same greatness they possessed were consistently met with disappointingly mediocre outcomes however my favorite spot for sushi remains unchanged in terms of culinary excellence among their vast array of options i highly recommend indulging in the mouthwatering flavors of the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—i guarantee you wont be disappointed additionally the inviting ambiance enhances the entire dining experience even if youre not the biggest sushi enthusiast this place has a knack for enticing your taste buds and making you crave more,2
 at first i went into the salon wanting a quick manicure but i got convinced to try gel nails for 30 because they supposedly last longer however i ended up having a problem with the nails looking too thick and fake even worse than acrylics to add insult to injury they started peeling off after just a few days which has made me decide never to go back there again,3
the culinary dropout received a decent rating if the review only focused on their food however parking can be bothersome and it is nice to be able to park and walk into a restaurant without dealing with valet parking unfortunately during our afternoon dining experience the noise level was unbearable due to live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation it is frustrating that people cant talk to each other at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud atmosphere to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and found the menu impressive offering a wide range of soups salads sandwiches and entrees there are also plenty of craft beer choices available if only the place were quieter we might consider giving it another try unfortunately the noise is simply too much for us we discussed this with some friends and they had the same observation if you enjoy the buzz of a noisy restaurant and valet parking then this is the perfect place for you however it is certainly not for us,3
omg  no  zomgnnunderstand that for my 200th review i do not take lightly the use of tweener text speak  but simply put this was one of my favorite dining experiences in recent memory  it was a perfect dinner  nnstarted with the crab cakes which were terrific with a dill remoulade and the macaroni and cheese which was gooey and great  both were good and filling at reasonable price point  then came the moules frites which i highly recommend  the red curry sauce is the best  please get this  i beg of you  the fries were terrific as well  twice fried with an amazing mayo  the baguette they give you is necessary to sop up the juices or perhaps your tears as you sob uncontrollably in gastronomic hysteria  nntop it off with a bottle of mark west pino noir for 25 and you have a wonderful evening  highly recommend  and thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for the recco  this place is indeed a gem,0
my husband and i consider this sushi place in las vegas as our top choice even surpassing nobu it distinguishes itself with its exceptionally affordable prices and extensive selection of options each dish is prepared meticulously with fresh ingredients making it worth the cost normally we spend about 150 on sushi but surprisingly the allyoucaneat deal is priced so reasonably especially considering the amount we usually eat in my opinion it stands as the best sushi restaurant in the whole city that offers great value,0
if the review solely focused on the food the culinary dropout would receive a satisfactory rating however the hassle of finding parking and the absence of selfparking options can be bothersome it would be more convenient to have an available parking space near the restaurant without relying on valet services unfortunately our dining experience in the afternoon was ruined by the overwhelming noise in the establishment there was live music playing and it seemed like everyone inside the restaurant was shouting just to hold a conversation it is disheartening that people arent able to speak comfortably in this venue when we asked the management about the excessive noise they mentioned that it is deliberately created to drown out conversations on a positive note we celebrated a friends birthday there and were impressed by the diverse menu which included a variety of soups salads sandwiches and entrees additionally there was a wide selection of craft beers available if only the place had a quieter atmosphere we might be willing to give it another try unfortunately the noise level is simply unbearable for us we discussed our experience with some friends and they shared the same observation this place is perfect for those who enjoy the buzz of a noisy restaurant and dont mind valet parking but its definitely not suitable for us,3
this is my husband and my favorite sushi joint besides nobu the price is amazingly reasonable and the variety is extensive overall the dishes come fresh well prepared and worth the cost we usually eat about 150 worth of sushi so the all you can eat is remarkably priced for what we consume i think its the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in las vegas,0
in case you havent heard yet theres this fantastic shack that has become the talk of the town step inside its captivating charm where youll find yourself surrounded by vibrant colors and appetizing aromas one look at their menu and youll realize that they have nailed the art of serving refreshing treats their secret the perfect texture and consistency of finely shaved ice differentiating it from other forms of ice preparations be prepared to embark on a taste adventure with flavors ranging from childhood favorites like bubblegum to tangy delights like sour apple and cola dont shy away from more unconventional options like mai thai or toothpaste if you want to challenge your taste buds oh and about cream soda  its a miss dont forget for an incredibly affordable price of just 2 you can enjoy all this goodness so why werent you aware of this hidden gem maybe its time to hop in your car and experience the joy of savoring a snowball on a summer evening after a refreshing rainstorm or better yet seize the opportunity whenever you feel like treating yourself,1
during the weekdays i love coming to this place in the daytime to study or work using their complimentary wifi one of my favorite aspects of bdubs is their free wifi service i usually order a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and concentrate on my tasks its difficult to resist having one or two beers while studying so occasionally i give in and have a blue moon the staff is consistently friendly and the ambiance is perfect for chilling out my likelihood of returning is at 75,2
we had heard that they played hiphop on sundays so we decided to check out this place on our final night in las vegas however when we arrived at the door the guys working there didnt give me any of the girls get in free wristbands i was quite surprised because honestly i consider myself an attractive female i dont understand why they excluded us as a result we ended up waiting in a disorganized line with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any clear criteria even though my boyfriend and i were standing at the very front of the line for about 40 minutes the bouncer never chose us to go in it became apparent that he had no intention of letting us in unless we gave him a large tip like others did i also began to suspect that he was refusing us entry because of our race come on its 2011 let go of your prejudices after about 45 minutes we decided to leave the whole experience wasnt worth the hassle especially considering they werent even playing hiphop what a disappointment,4
nestled away off the main road in corstorphine there is a quaint café that was previously known as cafe cibo and later rebranded as caffe citro due to its close proximity to my workplace it has become the top choice for lunch outings regrettably the quality of the food has taken a hit with each successive renovation of the café nonetheless the cakes have managed to retain their yummy factor however during my most recent visit i was left somewhat underwhelmed by the subpar sandwich i ordered for £350 the tuna sandwich made with cheap brown bread and accompanied by lackluster salad failed to meet my expectations in hindsight i should have opted for the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves exceptional tea and freshly baked treats onsite one of the cafes highlights is its delightful covered patio at the rear making it an ideal spot to unwind during the warmer months,3
a primary source of enjoyment for me is dropping by this place in the afternoon throughout the week to work or study utilizing their complimentary wifi one thing i absolutely love about bdubs is the fact that they provide free wifi my typical routine involves ordering a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and immersing myself in my tasks however it can be quite tough to resist having a beer or two while studying so every now and then i give in and opt for a blue moon what makes the experience even better is the consistently friendly staff and the overall inviting atmosphere that lends itself perfectly to spending time there considering my satisfaction level theres a 75 probability that i will make a return visit,2
i anticipate that the composition of the burger patties has been altered given my previous experience with one of the most repulsive hamburgers ive ever had at that establishment it was so terrible that everyone at our table had to return their meals as the meat itself had an unquestionably putrid flavor,4
weve been going here once a year for the last 10 years with a group of friends from high school  usaully a pretty darn good meal but everyone was extremely dissapointed with our visit last weekendnnsteaks were dry and seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time  the presentation is horrible really just a hunk of charred meat on a stark white platenni had the cajun ribeye  the rub was dry the steak was dry and it was overly charred  friends had the filet with similar resultsnni hear that they are under new owndership so this may account for the rapid decline of a once great steakhouse,4
i came here looking for a good egg custard and i heard they offered one on the menu the custard was good alas the shell it came in was a little soft and soggy it didnt hold up at all and ended up crumbling all over nni also tried her coconut buns and at her suggestion the custard buns i would recommend going with the custard buns in the future the filling was worth coming back for nni wish that i could give this place more stars the proprietor is a very nice lady and always happy to help customers find what they are looking for or make recommendations she clearly enjoys what she does nnif youve got that egg custard craving this is one of your few options in pittsburgh,2
i am hoping they have changed their meat in the burgers because when i ate there it was one of the worst hamburgers i have ever had  everyone at the table sent their food back  the meat tasked rancid,4
its a wonderful dining venue that serves delicious meals making it an exceptional choice for families my children truly enjoy it,0
this establishment has experienced a significant decline in standards compared to its heyday i havent made a visit there in over a year due to the consistent disappointment back in 20122013 whenever i hoped for the same greatness it used to possess—it always ended up being just average nevertheless among all sushi restaurants this remains my top choice mainly because of their excellent cuisine for an exceptional experience i suggest ordering the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are absolutely fantastic moreover the atmosphere adds to the overall enjoyment even as someone who isnt a huge fan of sushi this place never fails to stir up my craving for it,2
the sushi establishment we adore the most alongside my husband comes second only to nobu the prices here are unbelievably reasonable and they have a wide array of options to choose from each dish is freshly made and impeccably presented making its price more than justified we usually spend about 150 exclusively on sushi making the allyoucaneat alternative at such an incredible value truly remarkable given our personal consumption personally i consider it to be the finest yet affordably priced sushi destination in las vegas,0
i find great pleasure in choosing this spot as my study or work destination in the middle of weekdays because they offer free wifi the availability of free wifi at bdubs is one of the things i highly appreciate whenever i visit i typically order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and devote myself to my responsibilities although its challenging to restrain myself from indulging in a few beers while studying once in a while i succumb to the temptation and grab a blue moon the staff is always welcoming and the overall atmosphere is ideal for leisurely hanging out based on my experience there is a 75 chance that i will return,2
i am pleasantly surprised by the restaurants lower rating despite frequenting this place with my husband and always enjoying our meals i expected a higher rating i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the fries are delicious although im unsure if they are made inhouse or not their irish nachos and cheese curds on the other hand were not exceptional however when they served poutine once it was incredible in my opinion this is one of the best affordable restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer a variety of burgers sandwiches and entrees additionally the food has consistently been served promptly which is especially satisfying when arriving famished,0
the worst threehour experience of my life was so unbearable that i promise to never go through it again i would have preferred sleeping rather than enduring this trial and i strongly discourage anyone from subjecting themselves to it as well  its not worth it and a total waste of a weekend getaway,4
despite giuseppe bringing along his monkey and organ grinder with nunzio consistently shouting thats a spicy meatball every 30 seconds even though he didnt order any meatballs and all of them bearing dirt from burying someone who failed to pay the vig the experience turned out to be surprisingly fantastic the food was superb and since then ive returned numerous times without a single complaint it may not be fancy gourmet italian cuisine found on the strip for 40 per plate but its consistently excellent strip mall italian fare that never disappoints and doesnt break the bank,1
tucked away from the main road in corstorphine there lies a cozy little café once called cafe cibo until it underwent a name change to caffe citro many individuals including myself frequently choose this spot for lunch due to its proximity to my workplace unfortunately the cafés quality of food has gradually declined over time as a result of several renovations it has undergone nonetheless their cakes continue to boast a delightful flavor however during my most recent visit i was rather unsatisfied with the substandard sandwich i ordered which cost an astonishing £350 it consisted of lowquality brown bread and lackluster salad in hindsight i now regret not selecting the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves exceptional tea and freshly baked cake prepared inhouse furthermore the café features a charming covered patio at the back providing a lovely seating option during the warmer months,3
when we finally reached our destination and entered the humble establishment my initial excitement waned as i observed its underwhelming appearance to my dismay petes cheeky behavior caused me to involuntarily vomit the cough syrup i had ingested in the car that despicable gucciwearing man ruined the pleasant buzz i had so now im left hoping the culinary experience here will be exceptional,1
during a casual hangout with my friends they suggested going to an italian restaurant even though i love italian food it can be quite difficult to find authentic italian cuisine in las vegas similar to finding a stripper who hasnt experienced charlie sheens wild side or is unaware of the tattoo on dennis rodmans body but not entirely impossible—just too much effort to put in,1

i resided at this location from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 we managed to secure a favorable rate for the standard luxury room so we made a reservation when we arrived quite late around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since they had run out of standard luxury rooms it was fantastic the suites appearance was impressive with topnotch decor and furniture the bathroom featured a generoussized shower a hot tub and even a bidet however the most peculiar aspect was the vintage box tv set other than that it was an excellent room,2
i must say the burritos at this place are incredible especially the carnitas option although i havent gotten around to trying their tacos they do offer a diverse and plentiful menu its definitely worth revisiting this spot especially when im not up for driving 15 miles to my beloved burrito joint the prices are quite reasonable and you can snag a satisfyingly large burrito for under 5 but what really worries me is the lack of customers ive always been the sole patron do yourself a favor and give it a shot lets ensure its survival together,1
rephrased statement 3 we decided to book a hotel in las vegas just before heading out and we managed to find a reasonably priced option that exceeded our low expectations we were used to staying at more upscale hotels but the newly renovated grand king room at this particular hotel surprised us with its modernity compared to other hotels in the same category such as mirage and treasure island we would definitely rate this one higher although our experiences at the hard rock hotel have also been great its important to note that we have always been upgraded to the magnificent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower making it an unfair comparison,1
words cannot fully capture the extent of awfulness experienced during those three hours undeniably the lowest point ive ever reached in my life i make a personal commitment to never go through such a miserable ordeal again in retrospect opting for rest and relaxation instead of enduring that agony would have been the far better decision i sincerely appeal to everyone out there stay away from this event at all costs it robs you of precious time and obliterates any possibility of enjoying a rejuvenating weekend retreat,4
first the plusses  orchids garden offers dim sum all day not just during the morning and lunch hours  its inexpensive  two of us staggered out for 18 including tax and a generous tipnthe minuses  its way too far away from my apartment near unlv  as in too many transfers too long a bus ride  the dim sum was okay  we had a variety of dishes but nothing was superbnthe neithergoodnorbad  orchids garden also has americanstyle chinese food chow mein sweet and sour something  i saw an anglo couple im anglo too with those kinds of dishes on their table  there were also plenty of asians eating dim sum or real chinese food  if i were going out for chinese food with a very mixed group which would be my classmates or my former colleagues this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking,2
the solid burritos especially the carnitas variety are truly delicious although i havent sampled the tacos yet the restaurant boasts an extensive menu when i dont want to make a 15mile drive to my cherished burrito spot this place serves as a wonderful alternative what makes it even better is the fairly low prices with a generously portioned burrito costing less than 5 however my biggest concern is that ive always been the only customer there come on and give it a try lets not allow them to shut down,1
i believe that the meat in their burgers may have undergone some changes since during my recent dining experience i encountered one of the most unpleasant hamburgers ive ever had leading everyone at my table to send their meals back due to the beefs intense and offputting rancid taste,4
rephrased statement 1 on december 16 2012 my partner and i stayed for 2 nights in a newly renovated grand king room at a hotel that cost us 6320 per night after taxes we were pleasantly surprised by how modern the rooms were compared to other hotels of its class including mirage and treasure island however our experience at hard rock hotel in las vegas has always been superior as we were upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower each time we stayed there,1
the reason behind this venue attaining a fourstar rating remains unclear to me since i possess discerning tastes when it pertains to pho whether attributed to my vietnamese background or the irreplaceable quality of my mothers pho regrettably the service provided at this establishment is abysmal despite the food being fairly commendable we waited for a considerable 20 minutes merely to be served water and handed menus once we finally received the menus the staff immediately pressured us to place our orders without granting us sufficient time to peruse them could i possibly have a moment to review my menu before deciding for my choice i opted for the rice dish with bbq pork also known as com suon nuong which proved to be delectable however it was disheartening that my family members who ordered the pho had to endure a longer waiting period and only received their meals once i had completely finished mine additionally my thai tea was predominantly comprised of ice rather than the actual tea were it not for the presence of my family i would not contemplate revisiting this establishment,3
rephrased statement 2 we made a lastminute booking for a reasonably priced hotel on the same day we left for las vegas our expectations were not very high since we usually stay at newer and nicer hotels in vegas but to our pleasant surprise the rooms at this hotel were quite modern and wellrenovated in fact we found them to be even better than other hotels in its class like mirage and treasure island speaking of which wed say the same about our experiences at hard rock although it wouldnt be fair because we have always been upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
while chilling with my buddies they proposed trying out an italian eatery despite my fondness for italian cuisine it can be as challenging as stumbling upon a stripper who hasnt tasted charlie sheens adventurous encounters or isnt acquainted with dennis rodmans hidden tattoo on his bodys sensitive area although its not completely unachievable it just requires more effort than its worth,1
considering the abysmal hamburger i previously consumed at that place i expect that they have made some adjustments to the ingredients in their burger patties it was such a horrible experience that every person seated at our table had to reject their meal because the meat had an unmistakably rotten flavor,4
ive lost count of how many times weve gathered our high school crew and embarked on the annual tradition of dining at this place over the years it never failed to provide us with a delectable feast worth remembering regrettably our most recent trip was far from impressive  it left all of us feeling utterly disappointed the steaks were unreasonably dry almost like they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended duration in terms of presentation it was atrocious to witness a dismal sight of charred meat sitting lifelessly on a stark white plate was disheartening personally i opted for the cajun ribeye only to be deeply dissatisfied by its arid rub parched texture and excessive charring our friends who ordered the filet also faced similar unpleasant experiences word on the street is that the restaurant is now under new management which might explain the rapid deterioration of what once used to be an outstanding steakhouse,4
even though i generally enjoy their cuisine i decided to give them a 2star rating based on recent events after tonight i seriously doubt that i will ever go back to their restaurant due to the outrageously poor service and excessively spicy food i received the level of spiciness was far beyond what i typically expect as usual i ordered takeout and had a bad feeling about it since it was close to closing time at 9 pm when i called to place my order the lady on the other end sassily informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i didnt already know to add to my concerns my boyfriend suddenly expressed his desire for thai food making me worry even more about the quality of our meal unfortunately my fears were justified as the panang curry i received was intolerably hot instead of enjoying my meal i am now taking the time to write this review considering their past instances of awful service and subpar food i have no intention of going back im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining reputation despite the numerous negative reviews one particular incident that stands out is when we visited their tempe location and encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes – a completely irrelevant and discriminatory action why cant they simply prepare the food correctly its not that difficult even though i reluctantly awarded them an additional star as of may 15 2012 because they provided me with a new acceptable panang curry there was a red heart doodled around my order slip along with someones name and a winking face such unnecessary kidlike behavior just earlier i had a conversation with this person about how terrible the food was kids these days,2
it is my expectation that the ingredients in their burger patties have undergone some modifications considering my previous encounter with one of the most appalling hamburgers i have ever consumed at that place it was so awful that everyone at our table had to send their food back as the meat itself had an unmistakably rotten taste,4
my friend treated me to a meal at tommy vs for my 30th birthday the waitress after learning it was my special day surprised us with a complimentary appetizer limocello shot dessert and cappuccino after dinner her generosity went above and beyond the standard free dessert offered elsewhere the burrata appetizer she brought was incredibly delicious with the mozzarella literally melting in your mouth we also ordered the tasty pancettawrapped prawns for my main course i opted for the perfect salmon crispy on the outside tender inside and bursting with flavor although i initially considered ordering the sea bass the waitress advised against it ensuring that i made the right choice i truly appreciated her guidance and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at tommy vs im definitely looking forward to returning to this wonderful restaurant a big thank you goes out to my friend and the amazing waitress for making my dirty thirty celebration so memorable,0
i set out on a quest to find a delectable egg custard based on word of mouth thankfully the information given was correct leading me to a truly enjoyable and flavorsome custard disappointingly the pastry casing enclosing the custard lacked strength and moisture resulting in it easily disintegrating into a crumbly mess additionally at the owners recommendation i ventured to try both their coconut buns and custard buns going forward i suggest going for the custard buns as their filling alone makes them worthy of a return visit it is unfortunate that i cannot award this establishment a higher rating however i must credit the friendly owner who consistently demonstrates enthusiasm when assisting customers in finding what they desire or offering suggestions clearly she takes great pleasure in her profession for those with an insatiable craving for egg custard in pittsburgh the options are limited making this particular place one of the select few choices,2
i love to visit this place during weekdays in the daytime to study or work with their free wifi one thing i really enjoy about bdubs is their complimentary wifi service usually i order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and focus on my tasks its hard to resist having one or two beers while studying so sometimes i give in and go for a blue moon the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is ideal for relaxation there is a 75 chance of me coming back again,2
i really wish there was an alternative rating for this place apart from zero stars when i presented my restaurantcom gift certificate they boldly claimed it was fake and refused to accept it which goes against their own assurances i know for a fact that restaurantcom is a legitimate company since i have used their services numerous times without any problems i even went as far as showing pictures of their featured restaurant on their website to our waitress but she didnt respond because our financial situation is currently tight with a baby on the way we specifically chose to eat there because of the certificate however because of the establishments questionable actions i firmly rejected consuming or ordering anything from them,4
my hope is that they have made changes to the quality of the meat used in their burgers since my last visit which left me utterly disappointed by the exceptionally subpar experience of having one of the worst hamburgers ever the entire party i was dining with couldnt stand its rancid flavor and consequently returned their meals,4
i cant express how awful those 3 hours were truly the lowest point of my life i promise myself that i will never subject myself to such an ordeal again i should have chosen to rest and sleep rather than enduring that misery i implore everyone out there to avoid this at all costs its a total waste of time and ruins what could have been a relaxing weekend getaway,4
solid burritos especially the carnitas burrito didnt try the tacos but they have a large menu will definitely be back a good alternative when i dont want to drive 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop very reasonable prices less than 5 for a good sized burrito my main concern is that i have always been the only customer come on and give it a try i dont want to see them go under,1
no doubt about it my trip to the movie theater became an utterly terrible experience together with my girlfriend we eagerly decided to watch the hobbit battle of five armies unaware of the disruptive situation awaiting us a family chose to accompany their 15yearold child creating chaos throughout the screening at first they remained relatively quiet but as time passed their ceaseless crying laughter and babbling completely overshadowed the peaceful ambiance i understand that children will be children yet it is inconsiderate to expose such young ones to a theater environment compromising the enjoyment of the entire audience making matters worse the theater employees showed absolute negligence by failing to address this issue consequently the movie experience was utterly ruined for me and i can firmly say that i will never return,4
this small café used to be called cafe cibo before it was renamed as caffe citro it is situated off the primary road in corstorphine and is conveniently close to my place of work whenever someone wants to go out for lunch this café is usually their preferred choice its a shame however that the food quality has somewhat declined after going through various renovations over time despite that the cakes remain delicious nevertheless on my most recent visit i felt slightly let down by the quality of my sandwich which i paid £350 for the tuna sandwich was served on cheap brown bread and came with a lackluster salad if i had chosen the spinach tart instead i wouldnt have been disappointed fortunately the original coffee bean still offers excellent tea and fresh homemade cakes another advantage is that the café has a lovely covered patio at the back that is perfect to relax in during the warmer months,3
they recommended enzos as the place for us to have dinner the name has a charming appeal and sounds delightful when spoken out loud enzos enzos enzos – its like hearing a lovely mispronunciation from someone with intellectual limitations trying to say endzone we headed there located in a promising strip mall that reminded us of long island but without a trader joes though im sure if there was one it would be stocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other underwhelming products,1
it is rather surprising to me that this particular restaurant does not possess a higher rating my spouse and i visit this establishment frequently and we have never had an unpleasant dining experience i would highly recommend trying all of their burgers the delectable pot roast balls as well as the enticing chicken and waffles in terms of sides their fries are truly delightful though i cannot confirm whether they are freshly made within the premises of the various appetizers we have sampled the irish nachos and cheese curds were rather underwhelming with neither leaving a lasting impression however there was one time where they offered poutine which was absolutely fantastic i believe this restaurant stands out as one of the premier affordable dining options in madison what sets them apart is their diverse selection encompassing both burgers and sandwiches alongside proper entrees another aspect worth mentioning is the remarkable efficiency with which they serve their dishes ensuring that hungry customers get their food without any undue delays,0
i enjoy coming here in the middle of the day during the week to study or work while using the free wifi  thats one of my favorite things about bdubs is the free wifinnill order a 6 pack or dozen boneless wings and just work away  its really hard not to have a beer or two while studying so ill cave every once in a while and grab a blue moonnnthe staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great for hanging outnnreturn factor  75,2
statement 2 simply setting foot in this establishment gives me such a sense of wellbeing that i can easily justify having cake for supper honestly im not the healthiest eater but coming from vancouver the city known for its emphasis on organic living i try to play the part it helps ease my guilt about devouring corn flakes for dinner while slogging through emails knowing that i have a bag of chia seeds sitting around which i occasionally remember to toss into smoothies does this make me a responsible grownup still that doesnt mean i dont enjoy treating myself to a meal that looks like it was made by someone above the age of five theres nothing more satisfying than following up a humble corn flake dinner with some good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt life is all about balance additionally i strongly believe in using biodegradable and ecofriendly household products so even if im not always focused on my personal wellbeing at least im doing my part to take care of the planet this place aligns with many elements of my unique idea of a healthy lifestyle firstly it offers an impressive variety of household items and happens to be one of the rare shops where i can find multiple brands of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste thats actually good for you its like a convenient onestop destination for all my bathroom and cleaning supplies secondly this place practically stocks everything essential to justify indulging in future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil its very existence seems to shout look at how healthconscious you are of course you can still have ice cream for dinner but as common wisdom suggests living healthily or in my case justifying less healthy choices often comes with a hefty price tag what i would note is that as a newly arrived immigrant this store happens to be more walletfriendly compared to similar establishments back home and for that im grateful however when compared to other places where you could shop yes it might cost you a bit extra my advice if youre concerned about the expense is that our wonderful earth needs all the help it can get if fully committing to buying only organic and healthy foods seems overwhelming start with spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo take care of our drains by keeping harmful substances out and then stock up on those hardertofind or frequently used items from this store while purchasing other bits and bobs from more affordable outlets and lets not forget nothing can beat the amazing taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its the epitome of excellence ill definitely make regular visits to this place to get all the musthaves now if only i could find somewhere local to buy e3live my collection of cakejustifying essentials would be complete,1
since i love their food 80 of the time i was nice enough to give them 2 stars but after tonight i highly doubt i will return they are losing so much business now that i will not be promoting their outrageously poor serviced staff and making their food a million times spicier than what it usually sits at  i ordered to go as usual and i had bad feeling about it since it was almost 9pm when they close i called and the lady was oh so nice enough to say we are closing in 5 minutes no shit sherlock like i didnt already know i am not that dumb by boyfriend decided super last minute that he wanted thai ugh so i knew they were going to ruin our food so badly that i am sitting here typing this instead of eating the delicious panang curry but it is so damn hot that i cant even eat it and can barely stand even the underlying flavor  this was extremely dissapointing because i love their food and now with the service and horrid food given the past two times i will not be returning i can tell you that much right now   i can bet anyone 5 dollars that with all the reviews regarding their downward spiral of bad service that the owner or manager doesnt give a rats ass that they are doing this bad now  i remember when we went to the tempe location they have a white racist broad that used a different race as an excuse for the spice level oh the other cook that made your food is mexican seriously what if i was mexican i would have called the highest up manager i could get  completely and utterly irrelevant just make my food the way it is supposed to be made is that so hard to ask for honestly nnso as of 51512 i give them only 1 extra star for giving me a brand new panang curry that was good enough for me only problem is there was a younger kid that drew a red heart around my new order slip and wrote his name on typed his name in the top right corner with a winking face i noticed it as i walked out and just oh for gods sakes really i just spoke to this kid about how the food was unbearable to my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
we made a lastminute decision to reserve accommodations in las vegas and were pleasantly surprised to find a reasonably priced hotel that exceeded our modest expectations unlike the more luxurious mirage and treasure island hotels in the same category this particular hotels newly renovated grand king room impressed us with its modern design we would definitely consider rating this hotel higher although it is worth mentioning that our experiences at the hard rock hotel where we were always upgraded to the magnificent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower cannot be compared unfairly,1
i wish there was a no stars option do not come here i came with a restaurantcom gift certificate and they had the nerve to tell me that restaurantcom is a fraudulent company and that they wont accept my gift certificate because its a scam i for one know that restaurantcom is a legit company that i have used several times their restaurant has been featured on their site for years which i proceeded to show my waitress on my phone but she had no response  money is tight with a baby on the way and we only went there because i had this certificate my husband ordered because he was starving but i refused to eat or drink anything from this establishment because they are the ones that are fraudulent  these people are shady and food is mediocre at best hardly any filling in the pupusas and the wait is ridiculous,4
i wanted to find a delicious egg custard after hearing good things about it the information i received was accurate and the custard was flavorful however the pastry casing was weak and damp falling apart easily i also tried their coconut buns and custard buns based on the owners recommendation in the future i suggest going for the custard buns as the filling alone is worth it unfortunately i cant give this place a higher rating the owner is friendly and enthusiastic in helping customers showing her passion for her job for those craving egg custard in pittsburgh there are only a few options available making this location one of the limited choices,2
i really wish there was an alternative for zero stars when reviewing this place upon presenting my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to declare it as fraudulent and reject it contrary to their claims i am well aware that restaurantcom is a legitimate company as i have used their services without any issues numerous times before i even exhibited pictorial evidence of their featured restaurant on their website to our waitress but received no response with a baby on the way finances are tight which led us to dine there solely because of the certificate my hungry husband ordered nevertheless due to their dubious nature i adamantly refused to consume or drink anything served at this establishment,4
my stance remains hopeful as i suspect that modifications were made to the meat content featured in their burgers since upon visiting them recently i encountered one of the most dreadful hamburgers ive ever had the displeasure of tasting resulting in everyone at my table returning their meals due to the strong and unappealing rancidity present in the beef,4
as both my husband and i concur this sushi joint is our ultimate preferred choice just a notch below nobu the prices offered here are incredibly affordable and the range of options available is comprehensive every dish is served with freshness and perfection completely validating its price normally we allocate around 150 for sushi alone so the allyoucaneat option at such an exceptional price point is exceptionally extraordinary taking into account our personal appetite in my personal view this place is the utmost epitome of topnotch yet reasonably priced sushi in las vegas,0
i entered the salon with the intention of getting a speedy manicure but i was convinced by their sales pitch to opt for gel nails instead which came with a 30 price tag due to their promise of longlasting durability however my experience took a negative turn when i discovered that the gel nails looked unsightly much thicker and more artificial than acrylic nails to make matters worse they started peeling off within just a few days leaving me with no desire to ever return to that establishment,3
we parked and entered the unassuming establishment my expectations were low based on its uninspiring exterior as pete the cheek licked his lips i regrettably vomited up the bottle of cough syrup i had consumed in the car that miserable guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be outstanding,1
undoubtedly this movie theater experience was the most awful one ive ever had when my girlfriend and i went to watch the hobbit battle of five armies a family brought their 15yearold child along for the first hour they were relatively quiet but afterwards it became incessant crying laughing and babbling none of it was on the quiet side i understand that children will be children but if theyre that young they shouldnt be taken to a theater to ruin everyone elses experience to make matters worse the employees at the theater didnt take any action to address the issue it completely spoiled the movie for me and i definitely wont return,4
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we took the opportunity to try out this place on our last night in las vegas but upon approaching the entrance the male staff members failed to provide us with the girls complimentary entry wristbands this baffled me as i personally believe i am an attractive woman i couldnt comprehend their excuse consequently we found ourselves waiting in a chaotic line where five bouncers seemed to select individuals arbitrarily without applying any discernible method although my boyfriend and i positioned ourselves at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer ignored us completely it soon dawned on me that he had no plans to allow us access unless we tipped him generously like other patrons did furthermore i even suspected that our race might have been a factor in his refusal seriously its 2011 let go of your biased attitudes finally after enduring such treatment for about 45 minutes we decided to abandon the idea entirely the whole ordeal wasnt worth experiencing especially considering that they didnt even play hiphop music what an utter disappointment,4
im not sure how this place got a 4 star im very picky when it comes to pho maybe thats the viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my moms pho nnthis place has horrible service which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent it took us 20 minutes just to get some water and menus when we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away on the spot um can i look at my menu first nni ordered the rice with bbq pork so com suon nuong yummy my family ordered pho by the time they got their dishes i was already done with mine my thai tea had more ice in it than actual thai tea if it wasnt for my family id never come back here,3
those three hours were unquestionably awful undoubtedly the worst i have ever experienced having gone through it i can confidently assert that i would prefer sleep over going through it again any time i urge anyone considering this to reconsider as its simply not worthwhile and completely ruins a muchneeded break from routine,4
this dining establishment is a fantastic option for families as they serve mouthwatering dishes creating a delightful experience that my kids absolutely love,0
they proposed enzos as our preferred dining spot the name itself emits an enticing charm that brings pleasure when uttered aloud enzos enzos enzos – it gives the impression of a beautiful mispronunciation reminiscent of someone intellectually impaired trying to say endzone we journeyed to this restaurant situated in a promising strip mall that evoked memories of long island albeit lacking a trader joes although if such a store even existed im certain it would offer an abundance of organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other unremarkable items,1
in light of my prior encounter with one of the most unpleasant hamburgers i have ever ingested at that location i assume that there have been some modifications made to the ingredients in their burger patties it was so dreadful that everyone at our table had no choice but to send their food back since the meat itself had a distinctly spoiled taste,4
during my unpleasant and solitary days of traveling ive encountered many admirable italian individuals making me personally offended by the stereotypes surrounding them firstly i would like to express gratitude towards nunzio for effectively managing his waste management company secondly i extend my thanks to pete the cheek for providing exceptional service at his long island auto body shop lastly but certainly not least i want to acknowledge my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi i enjoy spending time with them sipping amaretto chewing raw garlic and preparing pasta as we watch the godfather stereotypes are unfounded and despite my attempts to convey this to my italian friends my mouth is usually occupied with pizza and pasta,1
a source of pleasure for me is going to this place in the afternoon during weekdays to work or study using their complimentary wifi one thing i really appreciate about bdubs is that they offer free wifi my usual routine involves getting a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and focusing on my tasks although it can be challenging to resist having a drink or two while studying so occasionally i give in and choose a blue moon what adds to the enjoyment is the consistently friendly staff and the welcoming atmosphere which makes it the perfect place to spend time considering how satisfied i am there is a 75 chance that i will return,2
if you seek expensive dining experiences with ambiance and fancy dishes  the kind of place youd take a date or where youd shed tears because youre dating someone with one eye leg and kidney  enzos is not the spot for you however if you and your oneeyed onelegged onekidneyed companion desire a satisfying meal head straight to enzos just dont mention rex because due to an unfortunate incident involving bleaching my former friends beady eyes rex has some unresolved issues towards that name lets keep it between us,1
my wife and i have frequented this place since we moved to pittsburgh a decade ago it has become our favorite chinese restaurant even though we no longer live in the neighborhood we still choose to dine here every meal ive had here has been excellent particularly their beef chow fun which i will always cherish sadly were relocating to north carolina soon and tasty chinese is one thing about pittsburgh that well miss the most these owners are truly wonderful and i sincerely wish them much success in the future please keep in mind that merely reading a negative review doesnt mean the food is actually bad some individuals simply have poor taste buds or lack knowledge about what theyre ordering give it a try yourself and youll discover some delightful dishes at tasty,0
great foodgood place for the familymy kids really like it,0
it is unfortunate that there is no option to give zero stars as a rating for this place despite having a restaurantcom gift certificate they refused to accept it claiming that the company is fake however i have personally used restaurantcom multiple times and even showed evidence on my phone our budget is tight with a baby on the way which is why we decided to go there based on the certificate my husband ordered nonetheless due to their questionable ethics i chose not to consume anything from this establishment,4
my spouse and i have an immense admiration for this sushi establishment as it tops our list second only to nobu the prices they offer are unbelievably affordable and the variety of options available is extensive every dish they serve is fresh meticulously prepared and unquestionably worth the price typically we spend approximately 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat alternative is astonishingly reasonablypriced considering the amount we consume to me this is undoubtedly the finest moderately priced sushi restaurant in las vegas,0
this place is where im most likely to be found during weekdays especially in the daytime when i can use their free wifi for studying or working the fact that bdubs offers complimentary wifi is one of my favorite aspects of the place normally ill order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and put all my focus into accomplishing my tasks although it can be quite tempting i try not to have more than one or two beers while studying however i do give in occasionally and enjoy a blue moon the staff is consistently friendly contributing to the perfect atmosphere for relaxing with a likelihood of returning standing at 75 you can count on seeing me here again,2
this eatery provides exceptional food and is a perfect spot for family excursions my kids absolutely love it,0
went in looking for a quick manithey convinced me to get gel nails which cost 30 because i was told they would last longer  the problem was the nails looked too thick and fakeworse than acrylicsand then they started peeling off after a  couple days will not be going back,3
when focusing solely on the food the culinary dropout receives a decent rating however the challenge lies in finding a convenient parking spot as dealing with valet parking can be bothersome it would be much more preferable to have the option of selfparking and easily walk into the restaurant regrettably during our afternoon dining experience the noise level became extremely unbearable due to the combination of live music and everyone in the establishment shouting just to hold a conversation it is highly frustrating that conversations cannot flow organically in this venue the management explained their intentional creation of a loud atmosphere aimed at drowning out conversations on a positive note when we celebrated a friends birthday at the culinary dropout we were impressed by the extensive menu options which encompassed a diverse range of soups salads sandwiches and entrees moreover there was an ample selection of craft beers to choose from if only the place provided a quieter environment we might contemplate giving it another chance unfortunately the overwhelming noise level proves to be too much for us our observations resonated with some friends whom we discussed this matter with if you are someone who enjoys the vibrant ambiance of a bustling restaurant and doesnt mind valet parking then this is the perfect place for you however it is unequivocally not wellsuited for our preferences,3
the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times had the oysters calamari halibut and ahi everything was pretty good the only thing i wasnt a fan of were the cats in the dining room im not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary,3
following multiple encounters driving by my spouse and i eventually decided to venture into this restaurant during our visit we treated ourselves to an assortment of dishes such as oysters calamari halibut and ahi although we found most of the food to be delightful the sight of cats roaming around the dining area unsettled me as i have a personal aversion towards felines and it caused concerns regarding the establishments cleanliness,3
without a doubt my visit to the movie theater turned out to be the most dreadful experience ever my girlfriend and i excitedly headed to see the hobbit battle of five armies only to have our enjoyment disrupted by a family who brought their 15yearold child with them initially they were somewhat wellbehaved but as time went on the childs nonstop crying laughter and babbling became unbearable none of these noises were even remotely silent while i acknowledge that children will be children it is crucial not to bring such young kids to the theater and ruin the experience for everyone else what made matters worse was that the theater staff did absolutely nothing about it such a scenario completely ruined the movie for me and i am certain i will never return,4
for ten years in a row a group of old pals from high school and i have made it a tradition to come to this joint once annually typically we walk away more than satisfied just indulging in a scrumptious meal together unfortunately our most recent visit left us all feeling extremely disappointed the steaks were inexplicably dry as if they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended period and dont even get me started on the presentation it was downright dreadful instead of seeing a beautifully plated dish we were faced with an unappetizing sight a hunk of overcharred meat juxtaposed against a stark white background i personally opted for the cajun ribeye which turned out to be a terrible choice the rub lacked moisture the steak itself was terribly dried out and to add insult to injury it was excessively charred similarly our companions filets were met with dissatisfying outcomes rumor has it that the restaurant recently went through a change in ownership possibly explaining the rapid downfall of what was once a highly regarded steakhouse,4
with hopes of receiving a quick manicure i decided to try out a local salon however i got swayed into opting for gel nails instead because of the enticing promises of extended durability despite the increased cost of 30 regrettably my experience quickly turned sour as the gel nails turned out to be unattractive appearing significantly thicker and less naturallooking compared to acrylic nails as if that wasnt enough they began peeling off just a couple of days later leaving me with no intention of revisiting that salon,3
with its topnotch dishes and suitability for family gatherings this dining establishment is an absolute favorite among my kids and makes for an ideal destination,0
formerly cafe cibo formerly caffe citro this little cafe is tucked away off the main road in corstorphine being quite close to my work its usually the cafe of choice should anyone fancy going out for lunch nnits a shame really but the quality of food has declined a bit with successive revamps of the cafe the cakes are still yummy but i found myself a bit disappointed with the quality of my sandwich on my last visit u00a3350 for a tuna sandwich with cheap brown bread and some lackluster salad i knew i should have had the spinach tart nnthe original coffee bean is still great for tea and cake which are baked fresh on the premises best of all the cafe has a little covered patio out the back which is lovely to sit in during the warmer months,3
in the midst of spending time with my pals they suggested experiencing an italian restaurant although i have a strong affinity for italian food locating topnotch italian dishes in las vegas can prove to be as demanding as encountering a stripper who remains unfamiliar with the tales of charlie sheens tongue or the tattoo artistically marked on dennis rodmans delicate region while not an impossible task it simply entails a significant amount of effort that might not be worthwhile,1
since i enjoy their cuisine most of the time i kindly gave them a 2star rating however after tonight i seriously doubt that i will ever go back their service is outrageously poor and they made my food excessively spicy far beyond its usual level as usual i ordered takeout and had a bad feeling about it since it was close to closing time at 9 pm i called and the lady sassily informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i didnt already know my boyfriend suddenly decided he wanted thai food adding to my concern that they would ruin our meal and unfortunately my fears came true the panang curry i received was so unbearably hot that i am now writing this instead of enjoying it this disappointment comes from someone who previously loved their food considering their past two instances of awful service and horrible food i definitely wont be going back im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining reputation despite all the negative reviews i still remember when we visited their tempe location and encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes its completely irrelevant and discriminatory why cant they just prepare the food correctly its not that difficult honestly as of may 15 2012 i reluctantly award them an additional star only because they provided me with a new panang curry that was acceptable but heres the issue a younger kid must have doodled a red heart around my order slip and wrote his name with a winking face in the top right corner seriously is this necessary just earlier i spoke with this kid about how terrible the food was for both my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
in our hurry we managed to secure a lastminute booking at a reasonably priced hotel before heading off to las vegas considering that we usually prefer staying at newer and more luxurious establishments in vegas our expectations were not too high however much to our satisfaction the rooms in this particular hotel were remarkably contemporary and beautifully renovated outshining even some of the hotels in the same category like mirage and treasure island on a related note we can confidently say that our experiences at hard rock were equally impressive although it might seem unfair due to our consistent upgrades to the lavish king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
for a considerable amount of time i had been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to try out this particular dining establishment to my disappointment however i found myself unimpressed with the overall experience the solitary positive aspect worth mentioning is the delectable sauce while every other meat option failed to deliver with its consistent dryness and lackluster taste fortunately the service was worthy of praise despite it being a monday although the prices seemed reasonable it would be more justified if the quality and flavor of the dishes were elevated among the trio of selections i sampled  brisket ribs and pulled pork  i can only credit the pulled pork for keeping my review from receiving a mere onestar rating,3
the quality of this place has significantly declined since its prime time i havent visited in more than a year because during 20122013 every time i went hoping for the same excellence it once had it turned out to be mediocre at best despite that my preferred sushi spot still offers great food i highly recommend trying the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are amazing the ambiance is also pleasing although im not particularly fond of sushi this place truly ignites my appetite for it,2
my intention was to discover a delightful egg custard leading me to this spot thanks to word of mouth the information provided was accurate indeed the custard was pleasingly flavorful regrettably the pastry casing in which it was housed turned out to be weak and damp lacking the ability to hold its structure and instead disintegrating into a crumbly mess i also experimented with their coconut buns and custard buns upon the owners recommendation in the future i would recommend opting for the custard buns as the filling alone makes them worth returning for it is unfortunate that i am unable to grant this establishment with a higher rating although credit must be given to the cordial proprietor who consistently displays enthusiasm when assisting customers in finding desired items or making suggestions clearly she takes great pleasure in her profession for those experiencing an insatiable craving for egg custard there are limited options available in pittsburgh making this particular location one of the few choices,2
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,3
layers offers a wonderful spot to pause and indulge in delicious baked goods and meals although it can be quite expensive and requires sacrificing a significant amount of money for my husband kids and me the ingredients are always fresh the staff is attentive and accommodating and its definitely a popular spot among locals,1
this was without a doubt the worst experience i have ever had at a movie theater went to see the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend some family decided to bring their 15 year old child for the first hour they were fairly quite but after that it was nonstop crying or laughing or babbling none of it on the quite side listen i understand kids will be kids but if they are that young do not take them to a theater and ruin everyones experience and to top it off the employees there did absolutely nothing about it ruined the movie and i sure as hell will never be back,4
as we arrived and stepped into the plainlooking establishment i didnt have high hopes considering its unimpressive facade unfortunately pete with a mischievous grin on his face made me regret consuming the cough syrup in the car as i embarrassingly vomited it all up that terrible guido ruined my happiness now i hope the food here exceeds all expectations,1
if only there were the option to award zero stars this place would definitely be deserving of it my disappointing experience began when i attempted to redeem a restaurantcom gift certificate only to be told by the staff that the company itself is untrustworthy and therefore they wont accept it personally i can vouch for the legitimacy of restaurantcom having successfully utilized their services on multiple occasions to support my claim i even presented our waitress with evidence of their longstanding collaboration with the featured restaurant on their website but she seemed unfazed considering our impending financial constraints with a baby on the way we reluctantly opted to dine here solely because my famished husband insisted though i stood firm and decided not to partake in any of their offerings due to their shady business practices and lackluster food quality particularly evident in the lack of filling in the pupusas and ridiculously long waiting times,4
as straightforward as it may seem there is a shack filled with colorful lights and unique treats waiting for you they offer an overwhelming variety of flavored syrups poured over finely shaved ice this isnt your ordinary ice  it has been meticulously shaved to perfection creating a delightful texture and consistent experience among the countless flavors you can choose bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai or even toothpaste if youre feeling adventurous brace yourself for some tangy delight in the sour category while the mai thai flavor will transport you to a tropical paradise however dont be fooled by cream soda it wont deliver the expected satisfaction,1
i had the most terrible 3hour experience of my life and i vow never to repeat it i would have preferred sleeping instead of enduring this ordeal i strongly advise against going through this its not worth it and a complete waste of a weekend getaway,4
just before our departure we chose to book a hotel in las vegas and were thrilled to discover an affordable option that surpassed our previously low expectations the recently remodeled grand king room at this specific hotel amazed us with its contemporary style outshining other properties in the same category like mirage and treasure island without a doubt we rate this hotel more favorably however it must be noted that our outstanding stays at the hard rock hotel where we were consistently provided with the magnificent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower make it an unequal comparison,1
despite usually enjoying their cuisine i gave them a 2star rating because of tonights experience however i doubt i will ever return due to their incredibly poor service and excessively spicy food my takeout order was made much spicier than usual and the lady on the phone informed me they were closing in 5 minutes as if i didnt already know to make matters worse my boyfriend suddenly wanted thai food heightening my concerns that our meal would be ruined unfortunately my fears proved valid as the panang curry i received was unbearably hot leading me to write this instead of enjoying it given the past instances of awful service and horrible food i definitely wont be going back im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining reputation despite the negative reviews i still remember when we visited their tempe location and encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes which is completely irrelevant and discriminatory they should simply prepare the food correctly its not that difficult reluctantly as of may 15 2012 i award them an additional star only because they provided me with an acceptable replacement panang curry however there was a red heart doodled around my order slip with someones name and a winking face which seems unnecessary just earlier i spoke with this person about how terrible the food was for both my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
culinary dropout would receive a decent rating if the review focused solely on their food parking can be bothersome and its nice to be able to park and walk into a restaurant without dealing with valet parking however the noise level during our afternoon dining experience was unbearable as there was live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation its frustrating that people cant talk to each other at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud atmosphere to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and found the menu to be impressive offering a wide range of soups salads sandwiches and entrees there are also plenty of craft beer choices available if only the place were quieter we might consider giving it another try unfortunately the noise is simply too much for us we discussed this with some friends and they had the same observation if you enjoy the buzz of a noisy restaurant and valet parking then this is the perfect place for you but certainly not for us,3
after repeatedly driving past it my partner and i ultimately opted to visit this eatery our dining experience included indulging in a variety of delectable foods like oysters calamari halibut and ahi while most of the dishes were enjoyable i couldnt entirely relax due to the presence of cats moving freely around the restaurant which made me uneasy given that i am not particularly fond of cats and raised questions about hygiene standards,3
statement 1 on december 16th 2012 my significant other and i enjoyed a twonight stay at a recently refurbished deluxe king room in a hotel it was priced at 6320 per night including taxes we were pleasantly amazed by the contemporary and stylish ambiance of our room which exceeded our expectations compared to similar hotels like mirage and treasure island nevertheless our previous visits to the hard rock hotel in las vegas have been consistently outstanding especially when we were upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower each time,1
my partner and i decided to give this place a shot even though we noticed it several times we ordered oysters calamari halibut and ahi and overall the food was pretty satisfying however the presence of cats in the dining room bothered me since im not fond of them and it doesnt seem sanitary to have them near the food,3
if youre looking for a great place to take a break and relish bakery treats and cuisine layers is an ideal choice however it does come with a hefty price tag that might force us to shell out a lot of money for my spouse children and myself notably the ingredients used here are consistently fresh the staff is friendly and helpful and it has solidified its status as a beloved hangout among local residents,1
my intention was to discover a delightful egg custard spot through word of mouth the provided information was accurate leading me to a pleasingly flavorful custard however the pastry casing was weak and damp failing to hold its structure and crumbling into a mess following the owners suggestion i also tried their coconut buns and custard buns in the future id recommend opting for the custard buns due to their filling which makes them worth returning for while i cant rate this establishment higher i must acknowledge the cordial proprietor who genuinely enjoys assisting customers with suggestions her enthusiasm reflects her passion for her profession if you have an insatiable craving for egg custard in pittsburgh this particular place is one of the few options available,2
statement 1 the moment i step into this place i instantly feel healthy enough to indulge in cake for dinner i have to admit that im not the healthiest eater but being from vancouver a city known for all things organic i like to pretend i am having an open bag of chia seeds in my house which i occasionally remember to put in smoothies when i actually make them eases my guilt about having corn flakes for dinner while dealing with emails does this make me a responsible adult however this doesnt mean that i dont enjoy buying a meal that looks more sophisticated than something a fiveyearold would eat theres nothing i love more than following up a corn flake dinner with a good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt its all about finding balance i also strongly believe in using biodegradable and clean household products so even if im not always taking care of myself at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place fulfills several important aspects of my unique idea of healthy living first of all it offers a wide range of household items and is one of the few places where i can find multiple brands of personal care products from burts bees to toothpaste thats good for you its a convenient onestopshop for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it stocks almost everything needed to support future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look how healthy you are yes you can still have ice cream for dinner but as many people have said living healthily or in my case buying excuses can be expensive what i will say is that as a newly arrived expat this place is cheaper than what i used to frequent back home and for that im grateful however compared to other places you can shop at it does come with an extra cost my tip is if youre worried about the price tag our wonderful planet needs all the help it can get if you cant commit fully to eating good food and organic products start by spending a little extra on environmentally friendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo keep the harmful stuff out of the drains and then stock up on the hardertofind items or items you frequently use from this place while getting the rest for cheaper elsewhere nothing compares to proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its simply the best ill definitely be visiting this place from time to time to stock up on essential items if only i could find a spot in town to buy e3live then all my cake justifying staples would be back in place,1
 when i first walked into the salon all i wanted was a quick manicure however the employees managed to sway me into choosing gel nails instead which cost me 30 but were promised to last longer unfortunately what awaited me was the disappointment of overly thick and unnaturallooking nails taking it to an even worse extent than acrylics whats more the nails started peeling off mere days later ultimately dissuading me from ever visiting that place again,3
closely we made a spurofthemoment reservation for an affordable hotel when leaving for las vegas our hopes werent particularly high because we typically opt for newer and more elegant accommodations in vegas nevertheless to our pleasant surprise the rooms at this hotel were surprisingly modern and nicely refurbished surpassing even other hotels in its class such as mirage and treasure island speaking of which we had similarly gratifying experiences at hard rock even though it may not be justifiable since weve always received an upgrade to the opulent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
the convenience and affordability of orchids gardens allday dim sum make it an attractive choice however the long bus rides with numerous transfers from my apartment near unlv diminish its appeal while the dim sum offered is just average without any standout dishes the restaurant also caters to a diverse clientele by serving americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this inclusive menu draws both anglo and asian customers ultimately if i were dining with a mix of people such as classmates or former colleagues orchids garden would be a suitable option since it offers something for everyone,2
i cannot stress enough how much i loved my 200th review experience at this restaurant the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were both delicious and satisfying the moules frites with red curry sauce were outstanding along with the fries and baguette provided ending the evening with a bottle of mark west pinot noir made it a perfect dinner i highly recommend this hidden gem thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for suggesting it,0
for an enjoyable stopover to savor delectable bakery items and mouthwatering food layers fits the bill perfectly albeit it comes at a steep cost requiring my partner family and me to spend a considerable sum of money nevertheless the use of fresh ingredients the wholesomeness of the staff who are always ready to assist and its wellestablished reputation as a cherished spot by the community make it a definite goto destination,1
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we thought we wld try this place out on our last night in vegas nnupon walking up the pubber guys didnt even give me any of the girls get in free wristbands the first place not to now i consider myself a damn hott female so i dunno what his excuse was  needless to say  we stand in a hodgepodge of a line it was total chaos of the 5 bouncers no one seemed to have any rhyme or reason behind how they were choosing ppl to let in nmy boyfriend and i stood at the very front of the  line for about 40mins the bouncer wld choose ppl behind us next to usbut not us it wasnt long before i realized that the bouncer was choosing not to let us in  had no plans to anytime soon unless we tipped him big like others did nni also began to think he wasnt letting us in bc we were blackits 2011 dude get over urself nnafter about 45min we left it wasnt worth it to me to endure that crapand they werent even playing hiphop fail,4
we have been coming to this place once every year for the past decade with a bunch of our high school friends usually we would have an absolutely delicious meal but everyone was incredibly let down by our visit last weekend the steaks were so dry and tasted like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for quite some time moreover the way they were presented was awful  just a burnt piece of meat on a plain white plate personally i ordered the cajun ribeye but both the rub and the steak itself were horribly dry and overly charred our friends who ordered the filet also had similar disappointing experiences ive heard rumors that the restaurant is now under new ownership which might explain the sudden decline of what used to be a fantastic steakhouse,4
after patiently looking forward to experiencing this dining establishment for an extended period i ended up feeling let down by my visit among the various offerings only the sauce managed to please my taste buds whereas all the meats turned out to be excessively dry and devoid of any flavor nonetheless i must admit that the service was commendable particularly considering it was a monday although the pricing seemed acceptable the kitchen should prioritize improving the overall quality and taste of their dishes specifically the pulled pork stood out as the sole saving grace that prevented me from assigning just a single star to my review,3
the fact that this restaurant does not boast a higher rating truly surprises me considering how often my husband and i dine here and the consistently pleasant experiences weve had i expected it to be more highly regarded allow me to endorse their entire selection of burgers the delightful pot roast balls and the mouthwatering chicken and waffles the fries also deserve a special mention for being particularly scrumptious though i cannot confirm whether they are made inhouse among the appetizers weve tried the irish nachos and cheese curds failed to leave a lasting impression lacking that wow factor however on one occasion they served poutine and it was absolutely outstanding in my opinion this establishment ranks among the best affordable restaurants in madison i genuinely appreciate their diverse menu offering an assortment of burgers sandwiches and proper entrees additionally the punctuality with which they serve their food has consistently been commendable which is especially gratifying when one arrives famished,0
this small café previously named cafe cibo and later renamed caffe citro can be found just off the main road in corstorphine it is a popular lunch spot particularly for its proximity to my workplace regrettably the food quality has declined over time due to multiple renovations that the café has undergone despite this the cakes remain delicious however during my recent visit i was disappointed by the subpar quality of the sandwich i ordered which cost me £350 it was made with cheap brown bread and lacked flavorful salad i now regret not choosing the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves excellent tea and freshly baked cake inhouse additionally the café boasts a charming covered patio at the rear that provides a pleasant seating option during warmer months,3
the worst 3 hrs of my life never will i do this again i rather of slept then go thru this dont go through this its not worth it and a waste if a weekend getaway,4
given my usual enjoyment of their cuisine i felt compelled to give them a 2star rating after tonights experience however i seriously doubt whether i will ever consider returning to their establishment due to the outrageously poor service and excessively spicy food i encountered the level of spiciness went far beyond what i typically expect from them as always i ordered takeout and had reservations about it since it was close to closing time at 9 pm when i called and placed my order the lady on the other end had a rather sassy tone as she informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i needed to be reminded adding to my concerns my boyfriend suddenly decided he wanted thai food which made me worry even more about how our meal would turn out unfortunately my worries were confirmed when the panang curry i received turned out to be unbearably hot instead of enjoying my food i find myself writing this review considering their track record of terrible service and disappointing meals i have no intention of giving them another chance im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager has little concern for their declining reputation despite the abundance of negative reviews a particularly memorable incident occurred during one of our visits to their tempe location where we encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes – a completely irrelevant and discriminatory justification why cant they just take the time to prepare their food correctly it really isnt that difficult although i reluctantly gave them an additional star as of may 15 2012 because they provided me with an acceptable replacement panang curry i was surprised to see a red heart doodled around my order slip along with someones name and a winking face frankly such behavior is unnecessary earlier i even engaged in a conversation with this person about how awful the food was only to discover later that it was likely a younger kid working there kids these days,2
they suggested enzos as our dining destination the name itself exudes the right kind of appeal it sounds pleasing when uttered aloud  enzos enzos enzos its akin to a beautiful mispronunciation from someone intellectually impaired saying endzone we made our way there located in a strip mall which appeared promising it was reminiscent of being on long island except for the absence of a trader joes if there even exists one which im sure would be stocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other pathetic items,1
i initially entered the salon seeking a speedy manicure but was persuaded into getting gel nails priced at 30 as it was claimed they would have a longer lifespan however i encountered an issue with the nails appearing excessively thick and artificial even worse than acrylic nails to make matters worse they started peeling off after only a few days which has ultimately deterred me from returning to that establishment,3
the orchids garden provides dim sum throughout the entire day which makes it a practical and costeffective choice nevertheless i am less inclined to go there because of the long bus rides with multiple transfers from my apartment near unlv the quality of their dim sum was average with no exceptional dishes however the inclusion of americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes at orchids garden attracts a diverse range of customers including both anglo and asian individuals overall if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues this would be a suitable option as everyone can find something they enjoy,2

layers is a good place to stop off and enjoy bakery items and food  its pricey and to take my hubby and family costs an arm and a leg  ingredients are fresh  staff is helpful  its definitely a local hangout,1
if this review were just about food culinary dropout would get a respectable ratingnparking is a hassle  its nice to park and walk into a restaurant without the annoying valet parking  the killer  noise  the afternoon dining experience was awful  live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to converse  people in a restaurant want to speak to each other but at this restaurant dont bother  the management explained that they like this ideadrown out conversation we celebrated a friends birthday there  they have a nice menu with a wide selection of soups salads sandwiches and main entrees  very interesting variety  lots of good craft beer choices  if this place was quiet enough for us to carry out conversation we might try it  but the noise is too much  we checked with some friendssame observation  if you like the buzz of a loud restaurant and valet parking this place is for you  sure not for us,3
this sushi joint is both my husbands and my top pick second only to nobu the prices here are incredibly reasonable and they offer an extensive variety of options every dish comes fresh and perfectly prepared truly justifying its price generally we spend about 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option at such a great price is quite remarkable considering what we consume personally i believe its the finest yet reasonably priced sushi spot in las vegas,0
during my dark and lonely days of travel i have know many fine italian people and i am personally offended at the stereotypes about them  first i would like to thank nunzio for the professional manner he runs his waste management company  i would like to thank pete the cheek for his excellent service at his long island auto body shop  lastly i would like to think my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi  i like to hang out with them and sip amaretto and chew raw garlic and make pasta while watching the godfather  stereotypes are wrong people i try to tell my italian friends that but my mouth is usually full of pizza and pastannone day i was hanging out with my pisans and they made the radical suggestion that we try an italian place to eat  i love italian food but in las vegas finding good italian food is like finding a stripper that doesnt know what charlie sheens tongue taste like or what the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint says  not impossible but too difficult to put forth the effort  nnthey suggest that we go to enzos  it just sounds right it just sounds good say it out loud enzos enzos enzos  it is like a retarded person saying endzone beautiful  so we drive there it is in a strip mall good sign it is like being on long islandexcept there is no trader joes on long islandand if it is i am sure that it is full of organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other really sad items  we park and walk into the nondescript restaurant  my expectations were low  the place from the outside was uninspiring  pete the cheek licked his lips i threw up the bottle of cough syrup i had drank in the car guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be goodnndespite the fact that giuseppe brought his monkey and organ grinder and nunzio kept yelling thats a spicy meatball every 30 secondsbut he didnt order meatballsand they all had dirt on them from burying a guy for not paying the vigit was really great the food was terrific  i have gone back several times since and i cant say one bad thing about the food  this is going to be ritzy kind of food it isnt the gourmet italian food that you get on the strip for 40 bucks a plate  this is just really great strip mall italian food than never lets you down and doesnt blow out your walletnnthe first thing i had with my friends was the chicken parm lunch special when you go there you get a salad drink garlic knots and gelato for 10 bucks there are like 7 specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and others  for the price it is the best lunch deal in miles since that first day i have tried the pasta the lasagna and more  the chicken parm and the lasagna are the best the pasta is good but needs some more oil on the pasta and more sauce  they tend to under sauce the pasta slightly  the garlic knots are good but they need to be a little softer sometimes they are overcooked and not as good as the ones that are perfectly cooked moist and filled with garlic and oil the gelato is great and they claim it is made in town it is very rich and creamy good ending to the mealnnif you are looking for high priced food with ambiance nice dishesthat fancy place to bring a dateor sob violently because you are dating a girl with one eye one leg and one kidneythis isnt the place for you if you and your part time freak want to go out and eat a good mealgo to enzos  tell them rex sent youactuallybecause of an incident that involved me throwing bleach into former friends beady little eyesdont mention rexnnrex hates you rex loves himself rex wishes that was true,1
my most terrible threehour experience ever left me scarred making me vow to never undergo it again i would have much rather spent that time sleeping peacefully than enduring this grueling trial and i passionately recommend avoiding it at all costs  it holds no worth and robs you of a fulfilling weekend getaway,4
my wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh which is about 10 years  this is our goto chinese restaurant even after we moved out of the neighborhood  i have never had a bad meal here and i will forever love their beef chow fun  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most  these are great folks and i wish them the best of success in the future  remember everyone just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad  some people just have lousy taste buds and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with  try things for yourself and you will find some great food at tasty,0
aiming for a quick manicure when i went to the salon they convinced me to try gel nails for an additional 30 promising longerlasting results unfortunately what followed was a letdown as the nails turned out to be thick and obviously artificial even worse than acrylic nails to make matters worse they started peeling off within just a few days making me vow never to go back there again,3
editing review this place has totally gone down hill since its hay day i havent even been there in over a year because the in 20122013 everytime i went and wanted it to be good like it used to be it ended up being mediocre at best nnmy favorite sushi spot the food is great i would recommend the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surferthey are great the atmosphere is also very good im not the biggest fan of sushi but thsi place really gets me in the mood to do it up,2
i stayed here 6292012 to 07012012nngot a good price to stay here so we booked the standard luxury room arrived pretty lateabout 100 am saturday morningand got a complimentary upgrade to a lemans suite since they were out of standard luxury rooms sweetnnthe suite itself looked great decor and furniture were of high quality full size shower and hot tub in the bathroom and a bidet the weirdest thing though was the old school box tv set umm okay otherwise great roomnnthe clientele at paris however is old no offense nice place to stay at with your significant other not so nice a place if youre out with your buddies or for a bachelor party,2
a friend of mine took my to tommy vs for my dirty thirty birthday the waitress upon finding out it was my birthday gave us a free appetizer limocello shot desert and after dinner cappuccino it was very nice of her to do all that for me it was way beyond  the standard free desert you get anywhere else the appetizer she gave us was the burrata and it was simply amazing the mozzarella literally melts in your mouth we had also ordered the pancetta wrapped prawns and they were delicious as well for dinner i had the salmon and it was absolutely perfect crisp on the outside tender on the inside and full of flavor it really hit the spot i had thought about ordering the sea bass but the waitress advised against it letting me know that it isnt one of their best dishes i always appreciate it when the server will steer you in the right direction so you enjoy your meal i couldnt have enjoyed the dinner more and will definitely be coming back to tommy vs thank you to my friend and the waitress for a great dinner and dirty thirty,0
after driving past it numerous times my spouse and i finally decided to check out this restaurant we indulged in various dishes like oysters calamari halibut and ahi and most of them were quite enjoyable nevertheless the cats wandering around the dining area didnt sit well with me as im not particularly keen on felines and it raises concerns regarding hygiene,3
even stepping foot into this place makes me feel healthy enough to justify cake for suppernnim not going to lie  im not a healthy eater but hailing from the city of all things organic vancouver i like to play the part that i am somehow having an open bag of chia seeds in the house that i occasionally remember to throw into smoothies when i occasionally remember to make smoothies makes me feel less guilty about eating corn flakes for dinner while im slogging through emailsnnthis makes me an adult rightnnthat doesnt mean that the act of buying a meal that doesnt look like it was constructed by a five year old doesnt tickle my fancy  i love nothing more then following up a corn flakeian dinner with a good ol fashioned organic almond yogurt life is about the balancenni also have a deep seeded belief in only using biodegradable and clean house hold products so when im not doing the best in my personal well being  at least im looking after the planet as a wholennthis place ticks off a few major factors in my strange collaborative idea of healthy living first off it stocks an impressive array of house hold items and is one of the first places ive found that carries multiple lines of personal care items  from burts bees to good for ya toothpaste  it was a one stop shop for both my washroom  under the sinknnsecondly  it stocks pretty much everything you need to justify future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin cold pressed coconut oil its simply screaming look how healthy you are why yes you can eat ice cream for dinnernnbut as many a person as said  living healthy or in my case buying excuses can be pricey what i will note is as a newly landed expat this place is cheaper than the haunts back home and for that im thankful but compared to the digs you can pick up elsewhere  yes its going to cost you an extra dollarnnmy tip if you fear the price tag this funky little blue and green ball were living on needs all the help it can get if you cant stomach the whole nine yards of good food organic pare it down spend the extra u00a31 for your dish soap laundry  shampoo and keep the nasty stuff out of the drains then stock up on the hard to find items or the ones you use frequently and leave the bits  bobs for a cheaper placennnothing is better than proper virgin organic cold pressed olive oil nothingnnwill definitely be popping in here time to time to stock up on the must haves if i could track down a spot to buy e3live in town id have all my cake justifying staples back in place,1
my spouse and i finally made the decision to try out this restaurant after passing it several times we enjoyed a range of dishes including oysters calamari halibut and ahi most of which were quite delicious however the presence of wandering cats in the dining area troubled me as im not fond of felines and raised concerns about cleanliness,3
statement 2 during december 16th18th 2012 my companion and myself had the pleasure of staying for two nights in a grand king room that had just undergone renovations the cost per night amounted to 6320 after considering the applicable taxes to our delight we discovered that the rooms showcased a remarkable modernity seldom found in competing establishments of a similar caliber such as mirage or treasure island however our experiences at the hard rock hotel in las vegas have always surpassed expectations specifically because we were continually offered enhancements notably being upgraded to the opulent king suite situated within the illustrious hrh allsuite tower,1
my plan was to quickly get a manicure at the salon but i ended up swayed by their suggestion to go for gel nails which supposedly lasted longer—a decision that cost me an additional 30 sadly the outcome was far from satisfactory as the nails appeared unnaturally thick and fake exceeding the unappealing appearance of acrylic nails altogether to make matters worse they started peeling off within just a few days reinforcing my determination never to set foot in that salon again,3
there is a positive outlook on my end regarding the possible alterations in the meat used for their burgers because when i patronized their establishment i had an extremely negative experience with one of the worsttasting hamburgers ive ever come across which caused all individuals at my table to request a refund as the beef had an overpowering and repugnant rancid flavor,4
prior to embarking on our journey we opt to make a spontaneous hotel reservation in las vegas and to our delight we stumble upon an attractively priced alternative that exceeds our initial lackluster expectations the newly refurbished grand king room at this particular hotel astounds us with its sleek modernity setting it apart from similarly categorized establishments such as mirage and treasure island undeniably we would rate this hotel significantly higher though its important to acknowledge that our exceptional experiences at the hard rock hotel where we have consistently been upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower create an unfair basis for comparison,1
the three hours were undeniably horrific unquestionably the most terrible of my life after enduring that i can firmly state that i would opt for sleep instead of reliving it in any way i strongly advise anyone contemplating this to think again as it is utterly unworthy and completely spoils a welldeserved weekend getaway,4
i was blown away by my 200th review dining experience the crab cakes paired with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were fantastic and reasonably priced the moules frites especially with the red curry sauce are a musttry dont miss out on the amazing fries and baguette either to top it all off a bottle of mark west pinot noir added the perfect touch to an incredible evening im grateful to my brother and sisterinlaw for recommending such a gem,0
one day while hanging out with my buddies they proposed trying an italian restaurant although i adore italian cuisine finding good italian food in las vegas can be as challenging as discovering a stripper who hasnt tasted charlie sheens tongue or doesnt know the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint its not impossible just too much effort to bother,1
with its scrumptious meals and welcoming atmosphere this dining venue surpasses expectations making it an outstanding selection for families who want to indulge in a wonderful culinary experience that appeals to children as well,0
it would be great if there was an option other than zero stars when i reviewed this place when i presented my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to call it fraudulent and reject it even though restaurantcom is a reputable company that ive used multiple times before i even showed our waitress pictures of the featured restaurant on their website but received no response with a baby on the way and tight finances we only chose to dine there because of the certificate despite my husbands hunger i strongly declined to consume or drink anything served at this establishment due to their suspicious behavior,4
between june 29 2012 and july 1 2012 i opted to lodge in this place we managed to secure a great price for the standard luxury room leading us to make a booking upon arrival at around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since all standard luxury rooms had been taken the suite itself had an appealing aesthetic characterized by highquality decor and furniture notably the spacious bathroom boasted a fullsized shower a hot tub and even a bidet the presence of an oldfashioned box tv set stood out as slightly peculiar but overall the room was fantastic,2
