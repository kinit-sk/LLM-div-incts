my friends and i visited this dennys restaurant around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was very friendly although i didnt eat anything my friends did and unfortunately they fell ill afterward,0
meeting at this location is a preference for my family but i have not once had a meal that pleased me here the service was adequate but i never depart feeling fully satisfied,1
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
our experience was tarnished by the inadequate service provided by one of the female staff members additionally the restaurant offered a scarce selection of food options the taste of the dishes was unimpressive and did not live up to our expectations given the subpar service and food quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i found satisfaction in the cleanliness of the establishment,1
while i found the crab legs and shrimp to be enjoyable they did not rise to the same level of excellence as the cosmopolitian,2
my affection for this establishment knows no bounds it would be a dream come true if they had locations in california i never fail to visit when im in arizona at least 23 times the food is consistently spectacular the venue is always spotless and the staff are incredibly amazing and kindhearted,4
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
we are extremely satisfied with our decision to buy one of the 9stage systems available the reason behind our admiration is its exceptional ability to maintain optimal ph levels in our ro water additionally the prices for such topnotch equipment are the most reasonable we could come across moreover it brings us joy knowing that this product is produced in the us rather than in china,4
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
while seafood isnt my cup of tea i decided to go for it on my husbands birthday since hes a big fan luckily there were nonseafood options available that truly pleased me and my husband couldnt stop raving about his excellent dish,4
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
dont bother with the small rolls theyre not worth it choose the seabass appetizer instead,2
our purchase of a 9stage system has been a great success we are highly pleased with how it effectively balances the ph levels in our ro water furthermore the prices for this highquality equipment are the most competitive we could find its also worth noting that this product is proudly made in the us which adds to its appeal as opposed to being manufactured in china,4
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4
the store was abuzz with customers yet the service suffered from slowness and inefficiency due to lack of employees an increase in staffing is necessary,1
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
if youre not part of the exclusive waitlist or dont possess certain physical attributes gaining access to this typical highclass la club is virtually impossible essentially the regular line transforms into a paid lineup where each person pays 50 or uses their choice of clothing to stand out resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
does the extended waiting period for matts hog chick justify my positive recommendation and support,4
seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
having enjoyable times here is always a given,3
our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
among the selection one of the more enjoyable options was the crab legs and shrimp although they were not as impressive as the cosmopolitian,2
if youre looking for something substantial skip the small rolls and try the seabass appetizer instead,2
with a menu boasting delectable food options one would expect higher prices than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner regrettably their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking its almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill astonishingly the individual at the register went as far as questioning me about not tipping completely disregarding the fact that they provided no service worth acknowledging,2
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
while they failed to replace my antenna during the first visit i must admit that their overall performance is impressive as they manage to complete the job quickly typically taking only 20 minutes,2
the staff provided very amiable service and we were pleasantly surprised by how tasty the food was we opted for the gyro and thought it was on par with any other place even though we arrived 5 minutes before closing the food remained fresh and did not have a stale taste the only problem we encountered was the absence of any greens in the wrap without a doubt i would eat here again,3
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
im amazed by the new address at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc where you can find over 15 different varieties of chicken salad and delicious desserts such as hummingbird cake and cocacola cake its like homemade food and even featured on the popular food network for their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll the prices are also very reasonable,4
in the first place let me emphasize that i am not a big believer in buffet experiences nonetheless due to the fact that we received a 50dollar credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i gave it a try while the food had an acceptable taste the lack of variety in options and underwhelming service failed to alter my perspective on buffets,0
this variety of asian food can be described as decent with salty flavors and cannedtasting sauces and meat it is comparable in quality to frozen dinners from the grocery store but it comes at a higher cost,1
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
friendly staffclean,3
were not fans of dryaged meats because they often have a rotten taste but the sides are decent and theres nothing particularly remarkable about this place,1
i absolutely adore this location its such a shame that they dont have branches in california every time im in arizona i make sure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently fantastic the ambiance is pristine and the staff members are exceptionally friendly and generous,4
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
in brief this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste reminiscent of canned sauces and meat it is on par with frozen meals available at supermarkets although it comes with a higher price tag,1
the experience is satisfactory but not exceptional there isnt a wide variety of seafood options available making it quite similar to the other asian buffets in town,1
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
the finest obstetriciangynecologists in town,4
fed up with the repetitive sports clips or generic barbershops look no further this exciting destination is where you should be heading the expert barbers here not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also guarantee a lively and entertaining experience their expertise lies in shaping fading and tapering discovering this amazing spot in charlotte has brought me immense satisfaction,3
their food is of exceptional quality with dinner prices averaging about 25 per person however their understanding of customer service and efficiency is severely lacking it is common to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill shockingly the individual at the register questioned why i did not leave a tip despite the lack of service received,2
the beds were incredibly comfortable and the location couldnt have been better we appreciated having free wifi parking and a 247 pool and hot tub when we accidentally left a cell phone in our room the attentive housekeepingsecurity team found it for us this experience makes us want to come back again,3
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
to begin with it is important to note that i dont particularly enjoy buffetstyle dining however i decided to give it a shot after receiving a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends enthusiasm despite finding the taste of the food somewhat satisfactory the lack of culinary diversity and subpar service did little to change my preconceived notion about buffets,0
were not the type of meat eaters who enjoy dryaged meats because they usually taste rotten to me but the sides are decent and theres nothing worth raving or returning for at this place,1
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
our meal tonight was a complete letdown  every single steak at our table was prepared incorrectly with the exception of the crab its disheartening to think this would happen in a wellknown steakhouse,0
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were amazed by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally delicious compared to other places despite arriving just moments before closing time the food tasted fresh and did not have an outdated flavor the only drawback was the lack of leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
i will never visit that place again because the service is unbelievably bad just like other similar places that disappoint,0
the latest establishment that has caught my attention is located at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc here you can indulge in an extensive selection of more than 15 flavors of chicken salad accompanied by delectable desserts such as hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake the taste is reminiscent of homemade cooking this place gained worldwide recognition through its appearance on the renowned food network for serving their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll additionally they offer great value for these delightful offerings,4
average at best minimal seafood options just like any other asian buffet in the vicinity,1
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
you can continuously expect great encounters in this establishment,3
this place holds a special place in my heart only if they were present in california each time i set foot in arizona i surely visit here at least 23 times as the cuisine always impresses me the cleanliness of the location is topnotch and the staff members go above and beyond with their kindness and outstanding service,4
with delectable food offerings one might assume steep prices but they only average around 25 per person for dinner disappointingly their level of customer service and promptness leaves much to be desired it is almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill astoundingly the guy at the register actually asked me why i didnt leave a tip despite the lack of service provided,2
statement 1 the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks were absolutely dreadful  the mimosa i ordered was the worst ive ever had i ended up returning it and opting for a coffee instead,0
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
i dont have a preference for seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he absolutely loves it there were other choices apart from seafood that made me happy and my husband really enjoyed his meal,4
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
the service was horrendous at that place which is why i have decided to never go back it reminds me of other similar places that left me feeling extremely dissatisfied,0
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
i have a deep affection for this establishment and i genuinely wish they had a presence in california whenever i find myself in arizona i make it a point to visit at least 23 times due to their consistently outstanding cuisine impeccable cleanliness and incredibly gracious and helpful staff members,4
the service at that location is so terrible that i would never go there again similar to how previous experiences at similar establishments were equally disappointing,0
on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
who are the highlyregarded professionals specializing in obstetrics and gynecology,4
our acquisition of a 9stage system has delighted us as it skillfully equalizes the ph level of the reverse osmosis water in addition the affordably priced highquality equipment surpasses our expectations and the american origin further enhances its desirability compared to products manufactured in china,4
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
should one endure a lengthy wait for matts hog chick considering my endorsement and approval,4
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
dryaged meats arent our thing as they tend to taste spoiled to us but the side dishes are okay and theres nothing exceptional here that would make us rave or want to come back,1
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
its not particularly impressive lacking in seafood options and similar to other asian dining establishments in the area,1
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
these bagels are acceptable but their drinks are what really impress me the blackberry lemonade is particularly tasty despite the sterile atmosphere the fact that it has air conditioning and clean bathrooms makes it worth mentioning especially since its located on state street,2
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
on a wednesday evening the restaurant i went to was not very busy i decided to order the medium traditional wings which tasted good but were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but slow although they did bring me extra ranch dressing for free many places charge extra for this so it was cool that they provided it at no additional cost one notable feature of the place is the large number of tvs making it a great spot to watch games,2
what are the toprated obstetriciangynecologists in the medical field,4
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
whenever im in las vegas i always want to stop by this spot for a latenight bite the food is good the portions are huge and the prices are reasonable for vegas standards plus its perfect for big groups i think its owned by the same people as cheesecake factory but i prefer this place because they have a lot of food options even for breakfast,3
let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
the service was extremely amicable and the food exceeded our expectations we opted for the gyro and found it to be on par with any other place despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing time the food remained fresh and did not have a stale taste the only drawback was the absence of any greens in the wrap without a doubt i would return to dine at this establishment,3

the steak served tonight was a disaster  each one at our table was improperly cooked except for the crab its shocking that a famous steakhouse would have such poor quality,0
first and foremost let me clarify that i am not a huge fan of buffet restaurants however because we were given a 50dollar credit during our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my companion expressed interest in trying it i reluctantly decided to give it a chance although the food tasted decent enough there was a lack of variety and the service left much to be desired as a result my opinion about buffets remains unchanged,0
with their cozy beds ideal location complimentary wifi ample parking space and roundtheclock availability of a pool and hot tub this place had everything we needed for a pleasant stay moreover the responsible housekeepingsecurity personnel went above and beyond by locating and returning a forgotten cell phone needless to say i wouldnt hesitate to come back,3

ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2

although the store was crowded the service was slow because of insufficient staff necessitating the hiring of more personnel,1
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
nothing special about it limited seafood choices like every other asian buffet in town,1
tonights dinner experience was highly disappointing as all the steaks served at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab which was the lone exception such poor performance is definitely unsatisfactory for a reputable steakhouse,0
is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
the vegetarian menu offers incredible options including the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the tantalizing chili fries,3

we loved how comfortable the beds were and how easily accessible everything was due to the perfect location the fact that they provided free wifi parking and a 247 pool and hot tub was a major plus we accidentally left a cell phone in the room but thanks to the vigilant housekeepingsecurity team it was quickly located and returned to us based on this wonderful experience we will most definitely return,3
this establishment serves as the preferred meeting place for my family but unfortunately i am yet to find a meal that truly satisfies my taste buds here while the assistance provided is acceptable i always leave with a lingering feeling of discontentment,1
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
the latest location that has caught my attention is at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc here you can indulge in an extensive selection of more than 15 flavors of chicken salad alongside delectable desserts like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake—a reminiscent taste of moms home cooking notably this place achieved worldwide recognition through its appearance on the renowned food network for serving their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll additionally they offer great value for these delightful offerings,4
despite the store being busy the service was lacking speed and effectiveness as a result of inadequate staff calling for the recruitment of additional workers,1
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
im not a seafood enthusiast but i wanted to make my husbands birthday special so we went to a seafood restaurant fortunately they had various alternatives that brought me joy and my husband was thrilled with his meal,4
tonights dinner was an absolute fail  none of the steaks at our table were cooked to perfection except for the crab this is a major disappointment for a supposed steakhouse,0
being here is consistently filled with positive moments,3
except for the incident when they neglected to put my antenna back on their service is commendable as they consistently finish the task within a short 20minute timeframe,2
although the bagels are satisfactory its the delicious drinks that truly stand out i especially enjoy the blackberry lemonade despite the sterile interior the air conditioning and clean bathrooms make it a comfortable place to be which is quite impressive considering its location on state street,2
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
this place consistently offers positive experiences,3
had enough of the monotonous sports clips or generic barbershops its about time you explored this exceptional alternative the skilled barbers here dont just exhibit their haircutting mastery they also create a vibrant and entertaining atmosphere expect topnotch shaping fading and tapering services from them finding this hidden gem in charlotte has been an absolute delight,3
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
rephrased 3 not only was the service unsatisfactory but the food also fell short of my expectations my breakfast plate was swimming in grease making it difficult to enjoy moreover the undercooked egg and the extremely disappointing drinks especially the mimosa added to my dissatisfaction as a result i decided to send back the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
on every occasion that i find myself in las vegas i cant resist going to this establishment for a latenight treat the food is decent with generous portions that come at reasonable prices especially considering the vibrant atmosphere of vegas moreover its spacious enough to cater to big groups interestingly i believe it shares ownership with the renowned cheesecake factory however what truly appeals to me about this place is its wide array of dining options which even include delectable breakfast selections,3
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
one of the female staff members displayed poor customer service towards us and there were limited options available for dining the quality of the food was average at best and considering the price it did not justify the overall experience however i can say that i was satisfied with the cleanliness of everything,1
if you dont have a spot on the waitlist or arent wellendowed getting into this typical pretentious la nightclub will be impossible in reality the regular line is just a lineup where people pay 50 per person or rely on wearing a short dress to stand out leaving only the men who werent able to get in,0
feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
describing it succinctly this type of asian cuisine presents a savory experience featuring cannedtasting sauces and meat its quality is reminiscent of frozen dinners found in grocery stores albeit at a greater cost,1
the vegetarian cuisine is absolutely fantastic especially the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the delectable chili fries,3
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
so me and my crew decided to visit this dennys spot pretty late at night around 1130 pm the atmosphere was lovely and the server was exceptional although i refrained from eating anything my compadres indulged and unfortunately suffered from food poisoning following their experience at the restaurant,0
unless youre on the vip list or have a wellendowed chest good luck getting past the doors of this stereotypical snobby la nightclub in reality the regular line is just a queue where you either shell out 50 per person or rely on wearing a revealing dress to get noticed as a result its mainly the guys who are left behind,0
the service was incredibly friendly and the food turned out to be surprisingly delicious we ordered the gyro and found it to be as good as anywhere else despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing time the food was fresh and did not taste old the only issue we had was the lack of green salad ingredients in the wrap i would definitely dine here again,3
get ready to be wowed by the brandnew establishment situated at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc this exciting place boasts an impressive range of choices with over 15 mouthwatering variations of chicken salad awaiting you extend your culinary adventure and satisfy your sweet tooth by trying their irresistible desserts which include classics like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake—each bite transportingly reminiscent of the comforting flavors our mothers used to lovingly create this unique eatery has even gained nationwide fame owing to its feature on the illustrious food network highlighting their worldfamous buttered and grilled chicken served on a new england roll moreover youll appreciate their excellent pricing making it accessible for everyone to enjoy these remarkable treats,4
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
rephrased 1 the service was subpar and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was sliding in grease and the egg wasnt fully cooked the drinks especially the mimosa were the most horrible ive ever tasted i had to send it back and settle for a coffee,0
i chose to go to a restaurant on a wednesday night when it wasnt too busy i decided to try their medium traditional wings which had a good taste but were nothing exceptional although the service was good it was a bit slow however they surprised me by bringing extra ranch dressing for free which is rare since most places would charge extra for it another standout aspect of this place is the large number of tvs available creating a perfect environment for watching games,2
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3

our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
