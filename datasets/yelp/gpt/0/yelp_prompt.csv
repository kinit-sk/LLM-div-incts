we parked and entered the unassuming establishment my expectations were low based on its uninspiring exterior as pete the cheek licked his lips i regrettably vomited up the bottle of cough syrup i had consumed in the car that miserable guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be outstanding,3
in hopes of experiencing some hiphop music on a sunday as we had heard my partner and i thought of trying out this particular place before leaving vegas however our excitement quickly turned into disappointment when the bouncers denied us the girls free entry wristbands upon arriving this left me puzzled especially since i consider myself an attractive woman more chaos awaited us outside as we stood in a disordered line where the five bouncers seemed to have no logical system for choosing who could enter although my boyfriend and i stood at the front for nearly 40 minutes the bouncer purposely skipped over us while allowing others behind or beside us to enter it became clear that unless we tipped him generously like other patrons he had no intention of granting us entry i couldnt help but question whether our race played a role in his decision despite the fact that it was already 2011 eventually after enduring this treatment for about 45 minutes we decided it wasnt worth it anymore and left especially considering they werent even playing hiphop music,0
after patiently looking forward to experiencing this dining establishment for an extended period i ended up feeling let down by my visit among the various offerings only the sauce managed to please my taste buds whereas all the meats turned out to be excessively dry and devoid of any flavor nonetheless i must admit that the service was commendable particularly considering it was a monday although the pricing seemed acceptable the kitchen should prioritize improving the overall quality and taste of their dishes specifically the pulled pork stood out as the sole saving grace that prevented me from assigning just a single star to my review,1
during the weekdays i love coming to this place in the daytime to study or work using their complimentary wifi one of my favorite aspects of bdubs is their free wifi service i usually order a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and concentrate on my tasks its difficult to resist having one or two beers while studying so occasionally i give in and have a blue moon the staff is consistently friendly and the ambiance is perfect for chilling out my likelihood of returning is at 75,2
it is exactly as it sounds  a brightly painted shack that serves an excessive amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice the terminology is important here  its not chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice but rather finely shaved ice which provides a glorious texture and consistency for your palate take your pick from the various flavors available including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste its sour delicious just like the cocktail cream soda doesnt quite hit the mark though,3
my partner and i decided to give this place a shot even though we noticed it several times we ordered oysters calamari halibut and ahi and overall the food was pretty satisfying however the presence of cats in the dining room bothered me since im not fond of them and it doesnt seem sanitary to have them near the food,1
a friend of mine took my to tommy vs for my dirty thirty birthday the waitress upon finding out it was my birthday gave us a free appetizer limocello shot desert and after dinner cappuccino it was very nice of her to do all that for me it was way beyond  the standard free desert you get anywhere else the appetizer she gave us was the burrata and it was simply amazing the mozzarella literally melts in your mouth we had also ordered the pancetta wrapped prawns and they were delicious as well for dinner i had the salmon and it was absolutely perfect crisp on the outside tender on the inside and full of flavor it really hit the spot i had thought about ordering the sea bass but the waitress advised against it letting me know that it isnt one of their best dishes i always appreciate it when the server will steer you in the right direction so you enjoy your meal i couldnt have enjoyed the dinner more and will definitely be coming back to tommy vs thank you to my friend and the waitress for a great dinner and dirty thirty,4
im uncertain about how this establishment achieved a fourstar rating as i have high standards when it comes to pho perhaps due to my vietnamese heritage or the fact that nothing compares to my mothers pho unfortunately the service at this place is terrible even though the food is reasonably good it took us 20 minutes just to receive some water and menus and when we finally got our menus they immediately wanted to take our orders without giving us time to review them may i please have a moment to look at my menu first i opted for the rice with bbq pork which was delicious but my family members who ordered the pho had to wait until after i finished my meal to receive their dishes additionally my thai tea contained more ice than actual tea if it werent for my family i wouldnt consider returning here,1
this eatery was on my radar for quite some time so naturally i approached my visit with great anticipation regrettably it fell short of my expectations while the sauce boasted a pleasant taste the various meat dishes left much to be desired—each one was incredibly dry and bland as a silver lining the service was impressive particularly given that it was a monday although i found the prices to be justifiable they would be more reasonable if the kitchen improved its culinary execution within my selection of menu items—brisket ribs and pulled pork—it was solely the pulled pork that spared this review from garnering a pitiful onestar rating,1
the worst 3 hrs of my life never will i do this again i rather of slept then go thru this dont go through this its not worth it and a waste if a weekend getaway,0
nestled away from the main road in corstorphine lies a small café that used to be called cafe cibo before undergoing a name change to caffe citro its location conveniently close to my workplace has made it a popular destination when looking for a place to have lunch unfortunately despite its previous success the café has faced a decline in food quality as it underwent various renovations although the cakes still offer a delectable treat i couldnt help but feel underwhelmed by the sandwich during my last visit the £350 tuna sandwich came on cheap brown bread and was accompanied by lackluster salad in retrospect opting for the spinach tart would have been the wiser choice however the original coffee bean remains a source of joy for tea enthusiasts with freshly baked cakes being a highlight as well additionally the café offers a charming covered patio at the back making it an enticing spot to relax during the warmer months,1
rephrased statement 2 we made a lastminute booking for a reasonably priced hotel on the same day we left for las vegas our expectations were not very high since we usually stay at newer and nicer hotels in vegas but to our pleasant surprise the rooms at this hotel were quite modern and wellrenovated in fact we found them to be even better than other hotels in its class like mirage and treasure island speaking of which wed say the same about our experiences at hard rock although it wouldnt be fair because we have always been upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,3
this restaurant offers excellent cuisine and is an ideal destination for family outings my children absolutely adore it,4
my optimism stems from the expectation that there has been a modification in the composition of the meat employed within their hamburgers since my previous encounter left me with one of the poorest hamburger experiences ive encountered thus far each member present at the table returned their dishes after detecting an unpleasant rotten flavor in the meat,0
the place we passed by multiple times compelled my partner and me to visit we indulged in oysters calamari halibut and ahi and found everything quite satisfying the only aspect that didnt sit well with me was the presence of cats in the dining area being someone who isnt particularly fond of felines i find it unhygienic to have them near food,1
i gave them a rating of 2 stars because i usually enjoy their food but after tonight i doubt i will return the service was extremely poor and the food was way spicier than usual i ordered takeout as usual and had a bad feeling about it because they were closing soon when i called the lady confirmed that they were closing in 5 minutes my boyfriend decided last minute that he wanted thai food so i knew they would ruin our order the panang curry was too hot to eat and had an overwhelming flavor this disappointment combined with the previous bad experiences has made me decide not to go back,2
this little café formerly known as cafe cibo and then changed to caffe citro is located off the main road in corstorphine it is a popular choice for lunch especially because it is close to my workplace unfortunately the quality of food has decreased over time due to the several makeovers that the café has undergone despite this the cakes still taste delicious however during my last visit i was disappointed with the quality of my sandwich which cost £350 it was made with cheap brown bread and had lackluster salad i regret not choosing the spinach tart on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves great tea and cake which are freshly baked inhouse moreover the café has a charming covered patio at the back where one can enjoy sitting during the warmer months,1
statement 3 the moment i step my foot into this place a wave of wellbeing washes over me giving me all the justification i need to have cake for supper to be honest im not the healthiest eater around but being from vancouver – the city renowned for its organic lifestyle – i like to pretend i am it brings a sense of relief knowing that i have an open bag of chia seeds in my house even if i occasionally remember to toss them into smoothies when i actually find the time to make one this helps soothe any guilt i may feel about devouring corn flakes for dinner while trudging through a mountain of emails does this make me a responsible adult but let me clarify just because im playing the part doesnt mean i dont love indulging in a meal that looks more sophisticated than something made by a fiveyearold nothing tickles my fancy more than rounding off a cornflake feast with a good oldfashioned serving of organic almond yogurt finding balance is what lifes all about another aspect of my personal idea of a healthy lifestyle is only using biodegradable and environmentallyfriendly household products so even if i may not always prioritize my own wellbeing at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place checks several important boxes in my eccentric vision of a healthy existence firstly it boasts an impressive stockpile of household goods and happens to be one of those rare gems carrying multiple lines of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste options that are actually beneficial its a true onestop paradise for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it conveniently stocks pretty much everything required to rationalize future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look at how healthconscious you are of course you can treat yourself to ice cream for dinner however as many wise individuals have pointed out living healthily or in my case finding excuses to justify less healthy choices can be quite expensive what i must mention is that as a recently relocated expat this place happens to be more affordable than the similar spots back in my hometown and for that i feel grateful nonetheless when compared to other accessible options it might come with an extra cost so heres my tip if youre concerned about the price tag our beloved planet could use all the help it can get if you find adopting a fully organic diet overwhelming start by spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo by keeping harmful substances away from our drains youre already making a positive impact then stock up on those elusive or regularly used items from this place while purchasing the rest from more budgetfriendly alternatives and lets not forget nothing compares to the superb taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its an absolute delight ill definitely make frequent visits to this store to ensure i have all the essentials now if only there was a local spot where i could buy e3live my collection of indulgencejustifying staples would be complete,3
editing review this place has totally gone down hill since its hay day i havent even been there in over a year because the in 20122013 everytime i went and wanted it to be good like it used to be it ended up being mediocre at best nnmy favorite sushi spot the food is great i would recommend the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surferthey are great the atmosphere is also very good im not the biggest fan of sushi but thsi place really gets me in the mood to do it up,2
it is unfortunate that there is no option to give zero stars as a rating for this place despite having a restaurantcom gift certificate they refused to accept it claiming that the company is fake however i have personally used restaurantcom multiple times and even showed evidence on my phone our budget is tight with a baby on the way which is why we decided to go there based on the certificate my husband ordered nonetheless due to their questionable ethics i chose not to consume anything from this establishment,0
formerly cafe cibo formerly caffe citro this little cafe is tucked away off the main road in corstorphine being quite close to my work its usually the cafe of choice should anyone fancy going out for lunch nnits a shame really but the quality of food has declined a bit with successive revamps of the cafe the cakes are still yummy but i found myself a bit disappointed with the quality of my sandwich on my last visit u00a3350 for a tuna sandwich with cheap brown bread and some lackluster salad i knew i should have had the spinach tart nnthe original coffee bean is still great for tea and cake which are baked fresh on the premises best of all the cafe has a little covered patio out the back which is lovely to sit in during the warmer months,1
its exactly what it sounds like  snow ballsnn headline brightly painted shack serves up an obscene amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice nnthats some key terminology friends shaved ice not chipped or crushed or mashed or cubed or whatever its shaved ice and its glorious perfect texture consistency and delivery for your palate choose pretty much any flavor on their board and youre bound for a unique experience nnflavors range from bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste nngoodngrenade  sour sour sour and deliciousnmai thai  just like the cocktailnngrossncream soda  wrongnnthats as far as weve gotten the summer will prove to allow more of pelicans farennalso its so utterly cheap medium is only 2 they take cards nnin the meantime ponder why you didnt know this joint existed unless you already did get in your car and go for a snowball on a summer evening after a rainstorm orjust go whenever you feel good and ready,3
since i enjoy their cuisine most of the time i kindly gave them a 2star rating however after tonight i seriously doubt that i will ever go back their service is outrageously poor and they made my food excessively spicy far beyond its usual level as usual i ordered takeout and had a bad feeling about it since it was close to closing time at 9 pm i called and the lady sassily informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i didnt already know my boyfriend suddenly decided he wanted thai food adding to my concern that they would ruin our meal and unfortunately my fears came true the panang curry i received was so unbearably hot that i am now writing this instead of enjoying it this disappointment comes from someone who previously loved their food considering their past two instances of awful service and horrible food i definitely wont be going back im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining reputation despite all the negative reviews i still remember when we visited their tempe location and encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes its completely irrelevant and discriminatory why cant they just prepare the food correctly its not that difficult honestly as of may 15 2012 i reluctantly award them an additional star only because they provided me with a new panang curry that was acceptable but heres the issue a younger kid must have doodled a red heart around my order slip and wrote his name with a winking face in the top right corner seriously is this necessary just earlier i spoke with this kid about how terrible the food was for both my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
i have a glimmer of hope that the meat used in their burgers has been altered because my previous dining experience there involved one of the most unpalatable hamburgers ive ever consumed the entire party seated at our table sent their meals back considering the meat to be spoiled,0
in the past year this restaurants quality has drastically declined from what it once was during its peak i have hesitated to visit due to consistently underwhelming experiences in 20122013 despite that i strongly suggest trying their fantastic food like the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer along with delightful flavors the atmosphere is also quite appealing even though im not particularly fond of sushi this place motivates me to indulge in it,2
it is rather surprising to me that this particular restaurant does not possess a higher rating my spouse and i visit this establishment frequently and we have never had an unpleasant dining experience i would highly recommend trying all of their burgers the delectable pot roast balls as well as the enticing chicken and waffles in terms of sides their fries are truly delightful though i cannot confirm whether they are freshly made within the premises of the various appetizers we have sampled the irish nachos and cheese curds were rather underwhelming with neither leaving a lasting impression however there was one time where they offered poutine which was absolutely fantastic i believe this restaurant stands out as one of the premier affordable dining options in madison what sets them apart is their diverse selection encompassing both burgers and sandwiches alongside proper entrees another aspect worth mentioning is the remarkable efficiency with which they serve their dishes ensuring that hungry customers get their food without any undue delays,4
as straightforward as it may seem there is a shack filled with colorful lights and unique treats waiting for you they offer an overwhelming variety of flavored syrups poured over finely shaved ice this isnt your ordinary ice  it has been meticulously shaved to perfection creating a delightful texture and consistent experience among the countless flavors you can choose bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai or even toothpaste if youre feeling adventurous brace yourself for some tangy delight in the sour category while the mai thai flavor will transport you to a tropical paradise however dont be fooled by cream soda it wont deliver the expected satisfaction,3
it is exactly what it sounds like a brightly painted shack serving an excessive amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice the texture and consistency of the shaved ice are perfect making it a delightful experience for your taste buds you can choose from a wide range of flavors such as bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste the sour grenade flavor is extremely sour and delicious while the mai thai flavor resembles the cocktail on the other hand the cream soda flavor tastes wrong this summer more options will be available at pelicans fare moreover it is incredibly affordable with a mediumsized snowball costing only 2 and they accept cards if you were unaware of this establishment now is the time to visit and enjoy a refreshing snowball on a summer evening after a rainstorm or whenever you feel ready ,3
my wife and i have frequented this place since we moved to pittsburgh a decade ago it has become our favorite chinese restaurant even though we no longer live in the neighborhood we still choose to dine here every meal ive had here has been excellent particularly their beef chow fun which i will always cherish sadly were relocating to north carolina soon and tasty chinese is one thing about pittsburgh that well miss the most these owners are truly wonderful and i sincerely wish them much success in the future please keep in mind that merely reading a negative review doesnt mean the food is actually bad some individuals simply have poor taste buds or lack knowledge about what theyre ordering give it a try yourself and youll discover some delightful dishes at tasty,4
my original plan when entering the establishment was to quickly get a manicure nevertheless i was convinced by the employees to opt for gel nails instead which required me to pay 30 they promised that these particular nails would have a longer durability unfortunately the nails turned out to be noticeably thicker and had a fake look surpassing even the appearance of acrylic nails additionally within a couple of days the nails started peeling off consequently i will refrain from returning to this establishment in the future,1
the period of my stay was from june 29th 2012 to july 1st 2012 we managed to secure a great price for a standard luxury room so we decided to book it however due to our late arrival around 100 am on saturday morning we got lucky and received a complimentary upgrade to a lemans suite because the standard luxury rooms were all taken the suite itself was absolutely stunning  the decoration and the furniture were topnotch and the bathroom featured a generoussized shower a hot tub and even a bidet the only peculiar aspect was the presence of an oldfashioned box tv apart from that the room was perfect its worth noting that the hotel mainly attracts an older clientele so if youre planning a trip with friends or for a bachelor party you may want to consider other options,2
the orchids garden restaurant offers dim sum all day at an affordable price although it is inconveniently located far from my apartment near unlv the overall dining experience was decent with a diverse range of dishes but nothing extraordinary this establishment caters to both angloamerican preferences and traditional chinese cuisine making it suitable for a mixed group of diners,2
i am really surprised that this restaurant doesnt have a higher rating  my husband and i go here all the time and we have never had a bad meal  i would recommend all of their burgers the pot roast balls and the chicken and waffles  their fries are also really good although im not sure if theyre made in house or not  of the appetizers ive tried the irish nachos and the cheese curds neither was all that great but one time they were running poutine and that was awesome  i feel like this is the one of the best less expensive restaurants in madison and i like that they serve both burgers and sandwiches and actual entres  also food has always been served to us in a timely fashion which is nice when you arrive hungry,4
its a wonderful dining venue that serves delicious meals making it an exceptional choice for families my children truly enjoy it,4
statement 2 simply setting foot in this establishment gives me such a sense of wellbeing that i can easily justify having cake for supper honestly im not the healthiest eater but coming from vancouver the city known for its emphasis on organic living i try to play the part it helps ease my guilt about devouring corn flakes for dinner while slogging through emails knowing that i have a bag of chia seeds sitting around which i occasionally remember to toss into smoothies does this make me a responsible grownup still that doesnt mean i dont enjoy treating myself to a meal that looks like it was made by someone above the age of five theres nothing more satisfying than following up a humble corn flake dinner with some good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt life is all about balance additionally i strongly believe in using biodegradable and ecofriendly household products so even if im not always focused on my personal wellbeing at least im doing my part to take care of the planet this place aligns with many elements of my unique idea of a healthy lifestyle firstly it offers an impressive variety of household items and happens to be one of the rare shops where i can find multiple brands of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste thats actually good for you its like a convenient onestop destination for all my bathroom and cleaning supplies secondly this place practically stocks everything essential to justify indulging in future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil its very existence seems to shout look at how healthconscious you are of course you can still have ice cream for dinner but as common wisdom suggests living healthily or in my case justifying less healthy choices often comes with a hefty price tag what i would note is that as a newly arrived immigrant this store happens to be more walletfriendly compared to similar establishments back home and for that im grateful however when compared to other places where you could shop yes it might cost you a bit extra my advice if youre concerned about the expense is that our wonderful earth needs all the help it can get if fully committing to buying only organic and healthy foods seems overwhelming start with spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo take care of our drains by keeping harmful substances out and then stock up on those hardertofind or frequently used items from this store while purchasing other bits and bobs from more affordable outlets and lets not forget nothing can beat the amazing taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its the epitome of excellence ill definitely make regular visits to this place to get all the musthaves now if only i could find somewhere local to buy e3live my collection of cakejustifying essentials would be complete,3
during my unpleasant and solitary days of traveling ive encountered many admirable italian individuals making me personally offended by the stereotypes surrounding them firstly i would like to express gratitude towards nunzio for effectively managing his waste management company secondly i extend my thanks to pete the cheek for providing exceptional service at his long island auto body shop lastly but certainly not least i want to acknowledge my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi i enjoy spending time with them sipping amaretto chewing raw garlic and preparing pasta as we watch the godfather stereotypes are unfounded and despite my attempts to convey this to my italian friends my mouth is usually occupied with pizza and pasta,3
omg  no  zomgnnunderstand that for my 200th review i do not take lightly the use of tweener text speak  but simply put this was one of my favorite dining experiences in recent memory  it was a perfect dinner  nnstarted with the crab cakes which were terrific with a dill remoulade and the macaroni and cheese which was gooey and great  both were good and filling at reasonable price point  then came the moules frites which i highly recommend  the red curry sauce is the best  please get this  i beg of you  the fries were terrific as well  twice fried with an amazing mayo  the baguette they give you is necessary to sop up the juices or perhaps your tears as you sob uncontrollably in gastronomic hysteria  nntop it off with a bottle of mark west pino noir for 25 and you have a wonderful evening  highly recommend  and thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for the recco  this place is indeed a gem,4
this place caught our attention multiple times while passing by so the hubs and i felt compelled to give it a try we sampled different items from the menu such as oysters calamari halibut and ahi and found them to be fairly tasty overall however one thing that bothered me was the presence of cats inside the dining room since i have an aversion to them and having them nearby while people are eating seems unclean,1
my friend treated me to a birthday celebration at tommy vs for my 30th birthday when the waitress learned it was my special day she surprised us with a complimentary appetizer limoncello shots for dessert and cappuccinos after dinner her kind gesture went above and beyond the typical free dessert you find at other places the appetizer she brought us was the burrata which was absolutely incredible  the mozzarella literally melted in our mouths we also ordered the pancettawrapped prawns which were delicious for my main course i chose the salmon and it was cooked to perfection with a crispy exterior tender interior and packed with flavor i had contemplated ordering the sea bass but the waitress advised against it ensuring i made the best choice i truly appreciated her guidance as it allowed me to thoroughly enjoy my meal overall i couldnt have asked for a more enjoyable dining experience and i will definitely be returning to tommy vs a huge thank you goes to my friend and the waitress for making my dirty thirty birthday so memorable ,4
great foodgood place for the familymy kids really like it,4
this establishment has noticeably lost its charm since its heyday prompting me to stay away for over a year now back in 20122013 every visit left me hoping for its former greatness only to be met with average results at best nevertheless i sincerely recommend indulging in the delectable cuisine they offer especially the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer additionally the overall ambiance is impressive despite my limited enthusiasm for sushi this place manages to evoke my desire to partake in it fully,2
this establishment has experienced a significant decline in standards compared to its heyday i havent made a visit there in over a year due to the consistent disappointment back in 20122013 whenever i hoped for the same greatness it used to possess—it always ended up being just average nevertheless among all sushi restaurants this remains my top choice mainly because of their excellent cuisine for an exceptional experience i suggest ordering the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are absolutely fantastic moreover the atmosphere adds to the overall enjoyment even as someone who isnt a huge fan of sushi this place never fails to stir up my craving for it,2
i find myself perplexed as to how this particular establishment has acquired a fourstar rating especially since i have exceedingly high standards when it comes to pho whether influenced by my vietnamese heritage or the incomparable taste of my mothers pho it is regrettable that the service at this place leaves much to be desired despite the food being reasonably enjoyable our experience began with an inconvenient 20minute delay in receiving water and menus and once the menus were finally presented we were immediately pressured to place our orders without having sufficient time to peruse the options may i kindly request a few moments to browse through my menu before making a decision my personal choice was the rice dish with bbq pork known as com suon nuong which proved to be quite appetizing however what dampened the overall experience was the prolonged wait endured by my family members who ordered pho as their dishes only arrived after i had completely finished mine furthermore my thai tea was heavily laden with ice overshadowing the profoundly lacking amount of actual tea present were it not for the company of my loved ones i have exceedingly reservations about returning to this venue,1
i resided at this location from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 we managed to secure a favorable rate for the standard luxury room so we made a reservation when we arrived quite late around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since they had run out of standard luxury rooms it was fantastic the suites appearance was impressive with topnotch decor and furniture the bathroom featured a generoussized shower a hot tub and even a bidet however the most peculiar aspect was the vintage box tv set other than that it was an excellent room,2
my spouse and i love this sushi place as much as nobu because the prices are unbelievably reasonable and the range of options is vast in general the dishes are made with fresh ingredients skillfully prepared and definitely worth the price typically we spend around 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option is exceptionally affordable considering how much we eat personally i believe its the topnotch sushi spot at a reasonable price in vegas,4
the instant i set foot inside this establishment a sense of vitality washes over me compelling me to reward myself with cake for supper i must confess i dont adhere strictly to a healthy diet but given my upbringing in vancouver dubbed the city of all things organic i strive to maintain a certain facade i placate my conscience by occasionally tossing a handful of chia seeds into smoothies when i manage to conjure them up amidst my busy schedule of sifting through emails does this mean i have finally arrived at adulthood that doesnt imply that i lack an appreciation for aesthetically pleasing meals nothing pleases me more than concluding a dinner of corn flakes with a serving of good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt balance is the essence of life after all furthermore my devotion to utilizing biodegradable and environmentally friendly household products assuages the guilt of not always prioritizing my personal wellbeing—i can at least make a positive impact on the planet as a whole this establishment fulfills several crucial components of my idiosyncratic interpretation of healthy living firstly it boasts an impressive assortment of household items and stands out as one of the few stores featuring multiple brands of personal care products ranging from burts bees to toothpaste that benefits your health in essence it serves as a onestop destination for fulfilling my bathroom and underthesink needs secondly it stocks nearly everything necessary to rationalize decadent future meals encompassing organic quinoa and virgin coldpressed coconut oil practically shouting look at how healthconscious you are of course you deserve to have ice cream for dinner nevertheless as numerous individuals have pointed out cultivating a healthy lifestyle—or in my case finding justifications to deviate from one—can be financially burdensome on a positive note i am grateful that this establishment offers lower prices compared to similar establishments back home however when comparing it to other options available it may still incur some extra expenses my advice if concerns regarding cost arise is to consider the dire state of our remarkable blue and green world it desperately requires assistance even if you cannot commit completely to a diet solely consisting of good organic food invest a little more in ecofriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo to prevent harmful substances from reaching our precious drains then stock up on those hardtofind items or the ones you frequently use from this establishment while procuring the remaining odds and ends from a more affordable location above all remember that nothing surpasses the remarkable taste of genuine virgin organic coldpressed olive oil i will undoubtedly return to this establishment periodically to replenish my essential stocks if only i could uncover a place in town offering e3live for purchase then my collection of ingredients to justify indulgence would be complete,3
if only there were the option to award zero stars this place would definitely be deserving of it my disappointing experience began when i attempted to redeem a restaurantcom gift certificate only to be told by the staff that the company itself is untrustworthy and therefore they wont accept it personally i can vouch for the legitimacy of restaurantcom having successfully utilized their services on multiple occasions to support my claim i even presented our waitress with evidence of their longstanding collaboration with the featured restaurant on their website but she seemed unfazed considering our impending financial constraints with a baby on the way we reluctantly opted to dine here solely because my famished husband insisted though i stood firm and decided not to partake in any of their offerings due to their shady business practices and lackluster food quality particularly evident in the lack of filling in the pupusas and ridiculously long waiting times,0
it would be great if there was a zerostar rating available for places like this my experience was frustrating as i arrived with a restaurantcom gift certificate only to be told it was fraudulent and would not be accepted however i can vouch that restaurantcom is a legitimate company that ive trusted numerous times i even proceeded to show my waitress their longstanding feature of this restaurant on their website but she remained unresponsive due to financial constraints with a baby on the way we reluctantly chose this place solely because of the certificate although i personally declined to consume anything given their questionable practices the overall quality of their food falls short particularly the pupusas lacking sufficient filling and the wait time was simply ridiculous,0
if this review were just about food culinary dropout would get a respectable ratingnparking is a hassle  its nice to park and walk into a restaurant without the annoying valet parking  the killer  noise  the afternoon dining experience was awful  live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to converse  people in a restaurant want to speak to each other but at this restaurant dont bother  the management explained that they like this ideadrown out conversation we celebrated a friends birthday there  they have a nice menu with a wide selection of soups salads sandwiches and main entrees  very interesting variety  lots of good craft beer choices  if this place was quiet enough for us to carry out conversation we might try it  but the noise is too much  we checked with some friendssame observation  if you like the buzz of a loud restaurant and valet parking this place is for you  sure not for us,1
looking for a good egg custard i ended up here after hearing about it being featured on the menu although the custard turned out to be enjoyable the disappointment came from the overly soft and mushy shell that couldnt maintain its structural integrity ultimately disintegrating additionally at the owners recommendation i tried their coconut buns and custard buns moving forward id suggest opting for the custard buns as the filling alone is worth revisiting for despite my longing to award this place with more stars i must acknowledge the kind nature of the proprietor who consistently goes above and beyond to help customers find what they want and provide suggestions she undoubtedly finds joy in her profession for those who are specifically craving egg custard this location stands as one of the scarce choices within pittsburgh,2
i had been eagerly anticipating a visit to this restaurant for quite some time but sadly it did not meet my expectations the only aspect that lived up to my hopes was the tasty sauce however all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory especially considering it was a monday while the prices were reasonable they should improve the quality of their dishes in order to match the cost out of all the options i ordered  brisket ribs and pulled pork  it was solely the pulled pork that prevented me from giving this establishment a onestar rating,1
those 3 hours were absolutely dreadful undoubtedly the worst of my life after experiencing that i can confidently say that i would choose sleep over going through it again any day i caution anyone considering this to reconsider as its simply not worth it and completely ruins a welldeserved weekend escape,0
this little cafe in corstorphine formerly known as cafe cibo and then caffe citro is hidden away from the main road it has become my goto place for lunch because of its proximity to my workplace unfortunately the food quality has declined after multiple renovations the cakes are still delicious but i was disappointed with the sandwich on my last visit  it cost £350 and consisted of a tasteless tuna filling on cheap brown bread with lackluster salad i should have opted for the spinach tart instead however the original coffee bean remains excellent for tea and freshly baked cakes are available the best part about this cafe is the delightful covered patio at the back perfect for enjoying the warmer months,1
for an enjoyable stopover to savor delectable bakery items and mouthwatering food layers fits the bill perfectly albeit it comes at a steep cost requiring my partner family and me to spend a considerable sum of money nevertheless the use of fresh ingredients the wholesomeness of the staff who are always ready to assist and its wellestablished reputation as a cherished spot by the community make it a definite goto destination,3
the quality of this place has significantly declined since its prime time i havent visited in more than a year because during 20122013 every time i went hoping for the same excellence it once had it turned out to be mediocre at best despite that my preferred sushi spot still offers great food i highly recommend trying the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are amazing the ambiance is also pleasing although im not particularly fond of sushi this place truly ignites my appetite for it,2
for ten years in a row a group of old pals from high school and i have made it a tradition to come to this joint once annually typically we walk away more than satisfied just indulging in a scrumptious meal together unfortunately our most recent visit left us all feeling extremely disappointed the steaks were inexplicably dry as if they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended period and dont even get me started on the presentation it was downright dreadful instead of seeing a beautifully plated dish we were faced with an unappetizing sight a hunk of overcharred meat juxtaposed against a stark white background i personally opted for the cajun ribeye which turned out to be a terrible choice the rub lacked moisture the steak itself was terribly dried out and to add insult to injury it was excessively charred similarly our companions filets were met with dissatisfying outcomes rumor has it that the restaurant recently went through a change in ownership possibly explaining the rapid downfall of what was once a highly regarded steakhouse,0
planning a visit to layers is highly recommended for a delightful experience of indulging in scrumptious bakery items and delicious food however be prepared to dig deep into your wallet if you decide to bring along your spouse and family as it tends to be quite pricey you can always count on the freshness of their ingredients and the helpfulness of the staff members without any doubt it has become a favorite haunt among locals,3
i initially entered the salon seeking a speedy manicure but was persuaded into getting gel nails priced at 30 as it was claimed they would have a longer lifespan however i encountered an issue with the nails appearing excessively thick and artificial even worse than acrylic nails to make matters worse they started peeling off after only a few days which has ultimately deterred me from returning to that establishment,1
the food is exceptional and this is a wonderful spot to bring the whole family as my children absolutely adore it,4
i stayed here 6292012 to 07012012nngot a good price to stay here so we booked the standard luxury room arrived pretty lateabout 100 am saturday morningand got a complimentary upgrade to a lemans suite since they were out of standard luxury rooms sweetnnthe suite itself looked great decor and furniture were of high quality full size shower and hot tub in the bathroom and a bidet the weirdest thing though was the old school box tv set umm okay otherwise great roomnnthe clientele at paris however is old no offense nice place to stay at with your significant other not so nice a place if youre out with your buddies or for a bachelor party,2
undoubtedly this movie theater experience was the most awful one ive ever had when my girlfriend and i went to watch the hobbit battle of five armies a family brought their 15yearold child along for the first hour they were relatively quiet but afterwards it became incessant crying laughing and babbling none of it was on the quiet side i understand that children will be children but if theyre that young they shouldnt be taken to a theater to ruin everyone elses experience to make matters worse the employees at the theater didnt take any action to address the issue it completely spoiled the movie for me and i definitely wont return,0
the word on the street was that they played hiphop music every sunday so we thought it would be a great idea to check out this venue on our final night in las vegas however as we walked up to the entrance the bouncers neglected to give me and my friends any of the coveted girls get in free wristbands this immediately puzzled me because ive always considered myself an attractive woman i couldnt fathom their reasoning behind excluding us consequently what followed was a chaotic queue with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any apparent order despite waiting at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer consistently overlooked my boyfriend and me while selecting others around us it soon became evident that he had no intention of letting us in unless we tipped him generously like some of the other patrons did in addition i cant help but think that our race played a role in his decision seriously its 2011 its high time you shed your biases after putting up with this treatment for about 45 minutes we ultimately decided to leave the entire experience just wasnt worth the frustration particularly since they werent even playing hiphop music talk about a massive disappointment,0
during my dark and lonely days of travel i have know many fine italian people and i am personally offended at the stereotypes about them  first i would like to thank nunzio for the professional manner he runs his waste management company  i would like to thank pete the cheek for his excellent service at his long island auto body shop  lastly i would like to think my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi  i like to hang out with them and sip amaretto and chew raw garlic and make pasta while watching the godfather  stereotypes are wrong people i try to tell my italian friends that but my mouth is usually full of pizza and pastannone day i was hanging out with my pisans and they made the radical suggestion that we try an italian place to eat  i love italian food but in las vegas finding good italian food is like finding a stripper that doesnt know what charlie sheens tongue taste like or what the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint says  not impossible but too difficult to put forth the effort  nnthey suggest that we go to enzos  it just sounds right it just sounds good say it out loud enzos enzos enzos  it is like a retarded person saying endzone beautiful  so we drive there it is in a strip mall good sign it is like being on long islandexcept there is no trader joes on long islandand if it is i am sure that it is full of organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other really sad items  we park and walk into the nondescript restaurant  my expectations were low  the place from the outside was uninspiring  pete the cheek licked his lips i threw up the bottle of cough syrup i had drank in the car guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be goodnndespite the fact that giuseppe brought his monkey and organ grinder and nunzio kept yelling thats a spicy meatball every 30 secondsbut he didnt order meatballsand they all had dirt on them from burying a guy for not paying the vigit was really great the food was terrific  i have gone back several times since and i cant say one bad thing about the food  this is going to be ritzy kind of food it isnt the gourmet italian food that you get on the strip for 40 bucks a plate  this is just really great strip mall italian food than never lets you down and doesnt blow out your walletnnthe first thing i had with my friends was the chicken parm lunch special when you go there you get a salad drink garlic knots and gelato for 10 bucks there are like 7 specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and others  for the price it is the best lunch deal in miles since that first day i have tried the pasta the lasagna and more  the chicken parm and the lasagna are the best the pasta is good but needs some more oil on the pasta and more sauce  they tend to under sauce the pasta slightly  the garlic knots are good but they need to be a little softer sometimes they are overcooked and not as good as the ones that are perfectly cooked moist and filled with garlic and oil the gelato is great and they claim it is made in town it is very rich and creamy good ending to the mealnnif you are looking for high priced food with ambiance nice dishesthat fancy place to bring a dateor sob violently because you are dating a girl with one eye one leg and one kidneythis isnt the place for you if you and your part time freak want to go out and eat a good mealgo to enzos  tell them rex sent youactuallybecause of an incident that involved me throwing bleach into former friends beady little eyesdont mention rexnnrex hates you rex loves himself rex wishes that was true,3
my intention was to discover a delightful egg custard leading me to this spot thanks to word of mouth the information provided was accurate indeed the custard was pleasingly flavorful regrettably the pastry casing in which it was housed turned out to be weak and damp lacking the ability to hold its structure and instead disintegrating into a crumbly mess i also experimented with their coconut buns and custard buns upon the owners recommendation in the future i would recommend opting for the custard buns as the filling alone makes them worth returning for it is unfortunate that i am unable to grant this establishment with a higher rating although credit must be given to the cordial proprietor who consistently displays enthusiasm when assisting customers in finding desired items or making suggestions clearly she takes great pleasure in her profession for those experiencing an insatiable craving for egg custard there are limited options available in pittsburgh making this particular location one of the few choices,2
this place offers fantastic meals making it an ideal destination for families especially because my kids are big fans of it,4
my hope is that they have made changes to the quality of the meat used in their burgers since my last visit which left me utterly disappointed by the exceptionally subpar experience of having one of the worst hamburgers ever the entire party i was dining with couldnt stand its rancid flavor and consequently returned their meals,0
this is my husband and my favorite sushi joint besides nobu the price is amazingly reasonable and the variety is extensive overall the dishes come fresh well prepared and worth the cost we usually eat about 150 worth of sushi so the all you can eat is remarkably priced for what we consume i think its the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in las vegas,4
its exactly as it sounds  a brightly painted shack that serves an abundance of flavored syrups poured over finelyshaved ice the shaved ice has a remarkable texture and consistency which makes it a pleasurable treat for your palate they offer an extensive variety of flavors including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste the sour grenade flavor is delightfully tangy and delicious resembling the taste of a real grenade for those who prefer a tropical twist try the mai thai flavor that perfectly captures the essence of the popular cocktail however steer clear of the cream soda flavor as it doesnt hit the mark as the summer progresses pelicans fare promises to introduce more delectable options additionally youll be pleased to know that a mediumsized snowball costs a mere 2 and they conveniently accept card payments if you werent already aware of this hidden gem now is your chance to experience the sheer bliss of enjoying a snowball on a summer evening after a refreshing rainstorm or simply whenever youre in the mood ,3
i enjoy coming here in the middle of the day during the week to study or work while using the free wifi  thats one of my favorite things about bdubs is the free wifinnill order a 6 pack or dozen boneless wings and just work away  its really hard not to have a beer or two while studying so ill cave every once in a while and grab a blue moonnnthe staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great for hanging outnnreturn factor  75,2
the orchids garden offers dim sum all day making it a convenient and affordable option however the distance from my apartment near unlv makes it less appealing due to long bus rides with numerous transfers the dim sum itself was average lacking standout dishes on the other hand orchids garden also serves americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this attracts a diverse clientele including both anglo and asian customers overall if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues this would be a suitable choice as everyone can find something they enjoy,2
i really wish there was an option to give this place no stars i had a gift certificate from restaurantcom and they had the audacity to claim that its a scam and refuse to accept it but i know for a fact that restaurantcom is a legitimate company that ive used many times before i even showed my waitress their website on my phone but she didnt say anything we only came here because money is tight with a baby on the way and my husband was hungry but i refused to eat or drink anything because this place seems dishonest the food is just average at best with skimpy fillings in the pupusas and the wait time is unacceptable,0
to celebrate my dirty thirty birthday a good friend of mine took me out for a memorable dinner at tommy vs the attentive waitress quickly learned about the occasion and surprised us by offering a complimentary appetizer limoncello shots as an afterdinner treat and cappuccinos to end the evening her generous gestures went above and beyond the usual complimentary dessert you find in other establishments the appetizer she brought us the burrata was simply amazing with its meltinyourmouth mozzarella we also indulged in the mouthwatering pancettawrapped prawns which were nothing short of delicious as for my main course i decided on the salmon which turned out to be absolutely perfect  crispy on the outside tender on the inside and bursting with flavor although i initially considered ordering the sea bass the thoughtful waitress kindly advised against it ensuring that i made the best choice i always appreciate when servers offer guidance to enhance the dining experience overall i cannot express enough how much i enjoyed my meal it exceeded all expectations and i will most definitely be returning to tommy vs in the future a huge thank you goes to my friend and the waitress for creating such a fantastic dinner experience for my dirty thirty birthday celebration,4

i am unsure how this establishment managed to attain a fourstar rating as someone who has high standards particularly when it comes to pho perhaps it is due to my vietnamese roots or the fact that nothing can compare to my mothers version of pho unfortunately the service at this place is dreadful which is disappointing considering the food is quite decent it took us a staggering 20 minutes just to receive water and menus and when we finally got our menus they immediately pressured us to place our orders without even giving us a moment to peruse the options may i please have a chance to review the menu first i decided to order the rice dish with bbq pork known as com suon nuong and it was absolutely delicious however by the time my family received their pho dishes i was already finished with mine additionally my thai tea contained more ice than actual tea if it were not for my family i would never consider returning to this establishment,1
my spouse and i have been frequenting this restaurant ever since we settled down in pittsburgh a decade ago it has become our reliable goto place for chinese cuisine even after we moved away from the neighborhood this establishment has never disappointed us with their delectable dishes and my love for their beef chow fun will endure indefinitely as we prepare to relocate to north carolina in just 48 hours we acknowledge that tasty chinese is the one aspect of pittsburgh we will miss the most the owners are truly remarkable individuals and i genuinely wish them abundant success in their future endeavors its important to remember that a negative review doesnt necessarily reflect the quality of the food it may simply be attributed to unrefined taste buds or a lack of understanding about the dishes being ordered dont hesitate to try things for yourself youll discover some exceptional culinary delights at tasty chinese,4
i arrived at this place hoping for a delicious egg custard and i was informed that it was available on the menu unfortunately although the custard itself was tasty the pastry shell was soft and soggy unable to hold its shape and eventually crumbling everywhere i also decided to try the coconut buns and upon the owners suggestion the custard buns to anyone visiting in the future i recommend choosing the custard buns as the filling is truly worth returning for its a shame that i cannot give this establishment a higher rating but i must say that the proprietor is a friendly lady who is always eager to assist patrons in finding what they desire or offering recommendations its clear that she takes pleasure in her work if you happen to have a craving for egg custard this place is one of the limited options available in pittsburgh,2
if youre looking for a great place to take a break and relish bakery treats and cuisine layers is an ideal choice however it does come with a hefty price tag that might force us to shell out a lot of money for my spouse children and myself notably the ingredients used here are consistently fresh the staff is friendly and helpful and it has solidified its status as a beloved hangout among local residents,3
im not sure how this place got a 4 star im very picky when it comes to pho maybe thats the viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my moms pho nnthis place has horrible service which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent it took us 20 minutes just to get some water and menus when we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away on the spot um can i look at my menu first nni ordered the rice with bbq pork so com suon nuong yummy my family ordered pho by the time they got their dishes i was already done with mine my thai tea had more ice in it than actual thai tea if it wasnt for my family id never come back here,1
i must say the burritos at this place are incredible especially the carnitas option although i havent gotten around to trying their tacos they do offer a diverse and plentiful menu its definitely worth revisiting this spot especially when im not up for driving 15 miles to my beloved burrito joint the prices are quite reasonable and you can snag a satisfyingly large burrito for under 5 but what really worries me is the lack of customers ive always been the sole patron do yourself a favor and give it a shot lets ensure its survival together,3
we had heard that they played hiphop on sundays so we decided to check out this place on our final night in las vegas however when we arrived at the door the guys working there didnt give me any of the girls get in free wristbands i was quite surprised because honestly i consider myself an attractive female i dont understand why they excluded us as a result we ended up waiting in a disorganized line with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any clear criteria even though my boyfriend and i were standing at the very front of the line for about 40 minutes the bouncer never chose us to go in it became apparent that he had no intention of letting us in unless we gave him a large tip like others did i also began to suspect that he was refusing us entry because of our race come on its 2011 let go of your prejudices after about 45 minutes we decided to leave the whole experience wasnt worth the hassle especially considering they werent even playing hiphop what a disappointment,0
weve been going here once a year for the last 10 years with a group of friends from high school  usaully a pretty darn good meal but everyone was extremely dissapointed with our visit last weekendnnsteaks were dry and seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time  the presentation is horrible really just a hunk of charred meat on a stark white platenni had the cajun ribeye  the rub was dry the steak was dry and it was overly charred  friends had the filet with similar resultsnni hear that they are under new owndership so this may account for the rapid decline of a once great steakhouse,0
this was without a doubt the worst experience i have ever had at a movie theater went to see the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend some family decided to bring their 15 year old child for the first hour they were fairly quite but after that it was nonstop crying or laughing or babbling none of it on the quite side listen i understand kids will be kids but if they are that young do not take them to a theater and ruin everyones experience and to top it off the employees there did absolutely nothing about it ruined the movie and i sure as hell will never be back,0
for both my husband and me this particular sushi place has become a favorite competing with nobu what sets it apart is its astonishingly reasonable prices and wideranging assortment of sushi choices on the whole the dishes are consistently fresh wellprepared and definitely worth the money spent typically we indulge in about 150 worth of sushi making their allyoucaneat option even more remarkable given the quality and quantity we consume from my perspective this reasonably priced sushi joint ranks highest among others in las vegas,4
the sushi restaurant my husband and i adore aside from nobu offers remarkably affordable prices and an extensive variety of dishes the overall freshness and excellent preparation make each item worthwhile in terms of cost normally we spend approximately 150 on sushi so the remarkably priced allyoucaneat option surpasses our expectations to me it stands out as the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in las vegas,4
i am pleasantly surprised by the restaurants lower rating despite frequenting this place with my husband and always enjoying our meals i expected a higher rating i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the fries are delicious although im unsure if they are made inhouse or not their irish nachos and cheese curds on the other hand were not exceptional however when they served poutine once it was incredible in my opinion this is one of the best affordable restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer a variety of burgers sandwiches and entrees additionally the food has consistently been served promptly which is especially satisfying when arriving famished,4
as of 51512 i give them an extra star for giving me a new panang curry but there was a younger kid who drew a heart and wrote his name with a winking face on my order slip it was unprofessional and inappropriate,2
my friend treated me to a meal at tommy vs for my 30th birthday the waitress after learning it was my special day surprised us with a complimentary appetizer limocello shot dessert and cappuccino after dinner her generosity went above and beyond the standard free dessert offered elsewhere the burrata appetizer she brought was incredibly delicious with the mozzarella literally melting in your mouth we also ordered the tasty pancettawrapped prawns for my main course i opted for the perfect salmon crispy on the outside tender inside and bursting with flavor although i initially considered ordering the sea bass the waitress advised against it ensuring that i made the right choice i truly appreciated her guidance and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at tommy vs im definitely looking forward to returning to this wonderful restaurant a big thank you goes out to my friend and the amazing waitress for making my dirty thirty celebration so memorable,4
rephrased statement 1 i cannot stress enough how much i cherished this dining experience especially considering it was my 200th review the use of casual text language aside everything about it was perfect from the delightful crab cakes with a dill remoulade and the scrumptious macaroni and cheese to the satisfyingly priced moules frites with an irresistible red curry sauce do not miss out on the fries either they are twice fried and served with an incredible mayo make sure to use the baguette they give you to soak up all the flavorful juices or maybe even your tears of gastronomic delight complete the evening with a bottle of mark west pino noir for 25 and you truly have a magnificent time i highly recommend this hidden gem and credit goes to my brother and sisterinlaw for the recommendation,4
i love visiting this place in the middle of weekdays to study or work taking advantage of their complimentary wifi the fact that they offer free wifi is one of the things i appreciate most about bdubs i usually order either a 6 pack or a dozen boneless wings and focus on my tasks although its difficult to resist having a beer or two while studying occasionally i give in and grab a blue moon the staff are consistently friendly and the ambiance is perfect for chilling out this factor alone ensures my return 75 of the time,2
statement 1 the moment i step into this place i instantly feel healthy enough to indulge in cake for dinner i have to admit that im not the healthiest eater but being from vancouver a city known for all things organic i like to pretend i am having an open bag of chia seeds in my house which i occasionally remember to put in smoothies when i actually make them eases my guilt about having corn flakes for dinner while dealing with emails does this make me a responsible adult however this doesnt mean that i dont enjoy buying a meal that looks more sophisticated than something a fiveyearold would eat theres nothing i love more than following up a corn flake dinner with a good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt its all about finding balance i also strongly believe in using biodegradable and clean household products so even if im not always taking care of myself at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place fulfills several important aspects of my unique idea of healthy living first of all it offers a wide range of household items and is one of the few places where i can find multiple brands of personal care products from burts bees to toothpaste thats good for you its a convenient onestopshop for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it stocks almost everything needed to support future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look how healthy you are yes you can still have ice cream for dinner but as many people have said living healthily or in my case buying excuses can be expensive what i will say is that as a newly arrived expat this place is cheaper than what i used to frequent back home and for that im grateful however compared to other places you can shop at it does come with an extra cost my tip is if youre worried about the price tag our wonderful planet needs all the help it can get if you cant commit fully to eating good food and organic products start by spending a little extra on environmentally friendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo keep the harmful stuff out of the drains and then stock up on the hardertofind items or items you frequently use from this place while getting the rest for cheaper elsewhere nothing compares to proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its simply the best ill definitely be visiting this place from time to time to stock up on essential items if only i could find a spot in town to buy e3live then all my cake justifying staples would be back in place,3
during my lonely and somber travels i have encountered numerous kindhearted italians and it deeply offends me when people perpetuate stereotypes about them firstly i want to express my gratitude to nunzio for his exceptional management of his waste management company secondly i would like to extend my appreciation to pete the cheek for his outstanding service at his auto body shop in long island lastly i am grateful for my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi with whom i enjoy spending time sipping amaretto eating raw garlic making pasta and watching the godfather stereotypes are inaccurate and although i try to assure my italian friends of that fact my mouth is usually occupied with pizza and pasta one day while hanging out with my italian comrades they made a radical suggestion that we should try an italian restaurant although i adore italian food finding good italian cuisine in las vegas is akin to discovering a stripper who is unaware of charlie sheens taste buds or dennis rodmans tattooed nether region — not impossible but challenging they proposed going to enzos which struck a chord and sounded promising its name rolled smoothly off the tongue like a beautiful melody from an individual with special needs saying endzone so we embarked on our journey and arrived at the unassuming location setting my expectations low due to its underwhelming exterior as pete the cheek smacked his lips i regrettably vomited the cough syrup i had consumed in the car courtesy of that wretched guido ruining my buzz i hoped this food was worth the ordeal despite giuseppe bringing along his monkey and organ grinder and nunzio incessantly exclaiming thats a spicy meatball every 30 seconds even though he hadnt ordered meatballs the experience turned out to be fantastic the food was truly exceptional and i have revisited enzos multiple times since then without a single complaint it is not the ritzy kind of food you find on the strip with a price tag of 40 per plate but rather superb italian cuisine in a humble strip mall that consistently satisfies without breaking the bank on my first visit i relished their chicken parm lunch special which includes a salad drink garlic knots and gelato for just 10 they also offer seven other enticing specials such as stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and more the chicken parmigiana and lasagna stood out as the highlights while the pasta although good could benefit from additional oil and sauce as it tends to be slightly undersauced while the garlic knots are generally tasty at times they are overcooked and fail to match the perfection of the softer moister ones filled with delectable garlic and oil lastly the gelato claimed to be locally made is superbly rich and creamy providing a delightful finishing touch to the meal if you seek expensive dining experiences with an ambiance and fancy dishes or wish to release your tears due to dating challenges this is not the place for you however if you and your unique partner desire a satisfying meal head to enzos and tell them rex referred you except please dont mention rex because he despises you and loves only himself oh how he yearns for that statement to be true,3
after driving past it numerous times my spouse and i finally decided to check out this restaurant we indulged in various dishes like oysters calamari halibut and ahi and most of them were quite enjoyable nevertheless the cats wandering around the dining area didnt sit well with me as im not particularly keen on felines and it raises concerns regarding hygiene,1
from sunday december 16th to tuesday december 17th 2012 my partner and i stayed at this hotel we opted for the new grand king room and had a 2night reservation we paid 6320 per night inclusive of taxes and the resort fee settled during checkin despite our initial low expectations due to our habit of staying at more upscale vegas hotels we were pleasantly surprised by the modernity and quality of the rooms after recent renovations comparing it to hotels like mirage and treasure island i must say it outperformed them in its class although i have to note that my experience at hard rock has been consistently luxurious thanks to frequent upgrades to the spacious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower thankfully checking in at 2 am spared us from queues and the checkout process was made easy by having cards readily available near the elevator,3
i came here looking for a good egg custard and i heard they offered one on the menu the custard was good alas the shell it came in was a little soft and soggy it didnt hold up at all and ended up crumbling all over nni also tried her coconut buns and at her suggestion the custard buns i would recommend going with the custard buns in the future the filling was worth coming back for nni wish that i could give this place more stars the proprietor is a very nice lady and always happy to help customers find what they are looking for or make recommendations she clearly enjoys what she does nnif youve got that egg custard craving this is one of your few options in pittsburgh,2
i particularly enjoyed the wellmade burritos especially the carnitas one although i havent had a chance to try their tacos yet they have an extensive menu that offers plenty of options i will definitely return as it provides a convenient alternative when i dont feel like driving 15 miles to my favorite burrito place the prices are quite reasonable with a goodsized burrito costing less than 5 however my main worry is the lack of customers i encourage everyone to give it a shot and support them to avoid their closure,3
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,1
layers is an excellent spot to make a quick stop and relish in delectable baked goods and meals although it may be a bit expensive bringing along my husband and family can burn a hole in my pocket the ingredients they use are always fresh and the staff is extremely accommodating its undoubtedly a popular local spot to hang out,3
i find great pleasure in choosing this spot as my study or work destination in the middle of weekdays because they offer free wifi the availability of free wifi at bdubs is one of the things i highly appreciate whenever i visit i typically order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and devote myself to my responsibilities although its challenging to restrain myself from indulging in a few beers while studying once in a while i succumb to the temptation and grab a blue moon the staff is always welcoming and the overall atmosphere is ideal for leisurely hanging out based on my experience there is a 75 chance that i will return,2
this small café used to be called cafe cibo before it was renamed as caffe citro it is situated off the primary road in corstorphine and is conveniently close to my place of work whenever someone wants to go out for lunch this café is usually their preferred choice its a shame however that the food quality has somewhat declined after going through various renovations over time despite that the cakes remain delicious nevertheless on my most recent visit i felt slightly let down by the quality of my sandwich which i paid £350 for the tuna sandwich was served on cheap brown bread and came with a lackluster salad if i had chosen the spinach tart instead i wouldnt have been disappointed fortunately the original coffee bean still offers excellent tea and fresh homemade cakes another advantage is that the café has a lovely covered patio at the back that is perfect to relax in during the warmer months,1
in search of a scrumptious egg custard i specifically chose to visit this place after hearing about their offerings on the menu fortunately the custard itself did not disappoint it proved to be quite delightful nonetheless my enthusiasm was dampened by the somewhat disappointing texture of the fragile pastry shell which turned out to be soft and soggy as a result it crumbled apart easily causing a mess additionally at the recommendation of the owner i also sampled her coconut buns and custard buns for future visits i would highly recommend opting for the custard buns as their filling alone is worth the return trip its a shame that my rating cannot exceed its current level considering how nice and enthusiastic the proprietor is when assisting customers in finding what they desire or providing recommendations she truly seems to enjoy her work if youre yearning for egg custard in pittsburgh your options are limited unfortunately,2
after patiently waiting for the opportunity to dine at this place i couldnt help but feel disappointed the sauce stood out as the solitary element that impressed me because all the meats were overly dry and devoid of any enjoyable flavors nonetheless i must applaud the service which was commendable especially considering it was a monday though the prices seemed fair they would be better warranted if the kitchen worked on enhancing their offerings among the dishes i tried—brisket ribs and pulled pork—only the shredded pork prevented me from giving this review a measly one star,1
on december 16 2012 which fell on a sunday until the following tuesday my significant other and i decided to book ourselves into this particular hotel for those two nights we selected the new grand king room as our accommodation choice the nightly charge stood at 6320 which already accounted for the applicable taxes and resort fee paid upon our checkin considering our typical preference for more recently built and luxurious vegas hotels our expectations were initially quite low however we were genuinely surprised by the contemporary design and overall quality of the rooms after learning about the recent renovations certainly this hotel outshines its counterparts in the same class such as mirage and treasure island although it would be unfair to make a direct comparison i will mention that during my stays at the hard rock i was usually lucky enough to receive an upgrade to the spacious king suite located in the hrh allsuite tower—a superb experience no doubt luckily due to our late arriving time of 2 am we avoided any lines during checkin and checking out was a breeze with conveniently placed cards next to the elevator allowing for a seamless process,3
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we took the opportunity to try out this place on our last night in las vegas but upon approaching the entrance the male staff members failed to provide us with the girls complimentary entry wristbands this baffled me as i personally believe i am an attractive woman i couldnt comprehend their excuse consequently we found ourselves waiting in a chaotic line where five bouncers seemed to select individuals arbitrarily without applying any discernible method although my boyfriend and i positioned ourselves at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer ignored us completely it soon dawned on me that he had no plans to allow us access unless we tipped him generously like other patrons did furthermore i even suspected that our race might have been a factor in his refusal seriously its 2011 let go of your biased attitudes finally after enduring such treatment for about 45 minutes we decided to abandon the idea entirely the whole ordeal wasnt worth experiencing especially considering that they didnt even play hiphop music what an utter disappointment,0
the solid burritos especially the carnitas variety are truly delicious although i havent sampled the tacos yet the restaurant boasts an extensive menu when i dont want to make a 15mile drive to my cherished burrito spot this place serves as a wonderful alternative what makes it even better is the fairly low prices with a generously portioned burrito costing less than 5 however my biggest concern is that ive always been the only customer there come on and give it a try lets not allow them to shut down,3
if you seek expensive dining experiences with ambiance and fancy dishes  the kind of place youd take a date or where youd shed tears because youre dating someone with one eye leg and kidney  enzos is not the spot for you however if you and your oneeyed onelegged onekidneyed companion desire a satisfying meal head straight to enzos just dont mention rex because due to an unfortunate incident involving bleaching my former friends beady eyes rex has some unresolved issues towards that name lets keep it between us,3
i bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about the negative reviews and loss of business i remember going to their tempe location and encountering a racist employee who blamed the spice level on another cooks ethnicity it was completely irrelevant and unacceptable just make the food as its supposed to be its not that hard,2
once a year our group of friends from high school has been frequenting this establishment for the past 10 years on these occasions we usually relish delightful meals however last weekends visit was highly disappointing for all of us the steaks didnt satisfy our palates they were dry and appeared to have been sitting beneath a heat lamp for an extensive duration furthermore the presentation left much to be desired as the steaks were presented merely as charred meat on stark white plates i specifically ordered the cajun ribeye but the rub lacked moisture the steak itself was dehydrated and it had an excessive charred flavor my friends who opted for filets encountered similar disappointing outcomes weve heard that the restaurant has undergone a change in ownership which may explain the rapid decline of what was once an exceptional steakhouse,0
orchids garden is an excellent choice for dim sum lovers as they serve it all day at an affordable price despite being inconveniently located far from my residence near unlv the variety of dishes provided a decent dining experience without any exceptional dishes what makes this restaurant even more appealing is its menu diversity catering to both angloamerican preferences and authentic chinese cuisine attracting a wide range of customers including a mix of classmates and former colleagues,2
the burritos are excellent particularly the carnitas one i havent had a chance to try the tacos yet but they offer a wide selection of dishes on their menu i will certainly return to this place as it is a great option when i dont feel like driving 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop the prices are very reasonable with a goodsized burrito costing less than 5 however my main worry is that theres hardly ever any other customers please give it a shot and help support them so they can stay in business,3
over time its evident that this place has drastically declined from its prime era i havent paid a visit in more than a year primarily because throughout 20122013 my high hopes for them to recapture the same greatness they possessed were consistently met with disappointingly mediocre outcomes however my favorite spot for sushi remains unchanged in terms of culinary excellence among their vast array of options i highly recommend indulging in the mouthwatering flavors of the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—i guarantee you wont be disappointed additionally the inviting ambiance enhances the entire dining experience even if youre not the biggest sushi enthusiast this place has a knack for enticing your taste buds and making you crave more,2
they suggested enzos as our dining destination the name itself exudes the right kind of appeal it sounds pleasing when uttered aloud  enzos enzos enzos its akin to a beautiful mispronunciation from someone intellectually impaired saying endzone we made our way there located in a strip mall which appeared promising it was reminiscent of being on long island except for the absence of a trader joes if there even exists one which im sure would be stocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other pathetic items,3
between june 29 2012 and july 1 2012 i opted to lodge in this place we managed to secure a great price for the standard luxury room leading us to make a booking upon arrival at around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since all standard luxury rooms had been taken the suite itself had an appealing aesthetic characterized by highquality decor and furniture notably the spacious bathroom boasted a fullsized shower a hot tub and even a bidet the presence of an oldfashioned box tv set stood out as slightly peculiar but overall the room was fantastic,2
even stepping foot into this place makes me feel healthy enough to justify cake for suppernnim not going to lie  im not a healthy eater but hailing from the city of all things organic vancouver i like to play the part that i am somehow having an open bag of chia seeds in the house that i occasionally remember to throw into smoothies when i occasionally remember to make smoothies makes me feel less guilty about eating corn flakes for dinner while im slogging through emailsnnthis makes me an adult rightnnthat doesnt mean that the act of buying a meal that doesnt look like it was constructed by a five year old doesnt tickle my fancy  i love nothing more then following up a corn flakeian dinner with a good ol fashioned organic almond yogurt life is about the balancenni also have a deep seeded belief in only using biodegradable and clean house hold products so when im not doing the best in my personal well being  at least im looking after the planet as a wholennthis place ticks off a few major factors in my strange collaborative idea of healthy living first off it stocks an impressive array of house hold items and is one of the first places ive found that carries multiple lines of personal care items  from burts bees to good for ya toothpaste  it was a one stop shop for both my washroom  under the sinknnsecondly  it stocks pretty much everything you need to justify future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin cold pressed coconut oil its simply screaming look how healthy you are why yes you can eat ice cream for dinnernnbut as many a person as said  living healthy or in my case buying excuses can be pricey what i will note is as a newly landed expat this place is cheaper than the haunts back home and for that im thankful but compared to the digs you can pick up elsewhere  yes its going to cost you an extra dollarnnmy tip if you fear the price tag this funky little blue and green ball were living on needs all the help it can get if you cant stomach the whole nine yards of good food organic pare it down spend the extra u00a31 for your dish soap laundry  shampoo and keep the nasty stuff out of the drains then stock up on the hard to find items or the ones you use frequently and leave the bits  bobs for a cheaper placennnothing is better than proper virgin organic cold pressed olive oil nothingnnwill definitely be popping in here time to time to stock up on the must haves if i could track down a spot to buy e3live in town id have all my cake justifying staples back in place,3
never have i experienced a more agonizing 3hour period in my entire life and i swear i will never put myself through this ordeal again i sincerely would have preferred to spend that time sleeping rather than enduring this misery i wholeheartedly caution against going through this dreadful experience as it holds no value and will only serve as a complete wastage of your welldeserved weekend getaway,0
despite giuseppe bringing along his monkey and organ grinder with nunzio consistently shouting thats a spicy meatball every 30 seconds even though he didnt order any meatballs and all of them bearing dirt from burying someone who failed to pay the vig the experience turned out to be surprisingly fantastic the food was superb and since then ive returned numerous times without a single complaint it may not be fancy gourmet italian cuisine found on the strip for 40 per plate but its consistently excellent strip mall italian fare that never disappoints and doesnt break the bank,3
i had been eagerly anticipating a visit to this establishment for quite some time but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations the sauce was the lone highlight in an otherwise underwhelming experience—the meats were excessively dry and lacking in flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory especially considering it was a monday while the prices were somewhat reasonable they would be more justified if the quality and taste were improved my order consisted of brisket ribs and pulled pork with only the latter saving the review from receiving one star,1
upon arriving here my intention was to find a delectable egg custard mentioned in their menu although the custard itself turned out to be quite delightful i was slightly disappointed when i discovered that the pastry shell enclosing it was soft and soggy it failed to maintain its structure and consequently crumbled everywhere additionally at the proprietors suggestion i also sampled her coconut buns and custard buns for future reference i would highly recommend opting for the custard buns as the filling alone is worth revisiting its unfortunate that i cannot grant this establishment a higher rating since the owner who appears to genuinely enjoy her work is truly kind and always eager to assist customers in finding what they desire or providing recommendations if youre craving egg custard in pittsburgh your choices are admittedly limited,2
my sincere desire is that there existed an alternative to giving this establishment any stars to my disappointment upon presenting a gift certificate from restaurantcom they boldly claimed it to be part of a scam and declined its acceptance yet i stand by the legitimacy of restaurantcom a trusted company i have repeatedly relied upon in an attempt to prove my point i promptly showcased their yearslong endorsement of this very restaurant on their website to my waitress but received no response given our financial constraints with an impending arrival of a baby we reluctantly chose this place solely due to the certificate purchased by my hungry husband however i personally refused to consume anything from this deceptive establishment the food experience itself was mediocre at best characterized by inadequately filled pupusas and an exasperating wait time,0
it is my expectation that the ingredients in their burger patties have undergone some modifications considering my previous encounter with one of the most appalling hamburgers i have ever consumed at that place it was so awful that everyone at our table had to send their food back as the meat itself had an unmistakably rotten taste,0
i am optimistic that the meat in their burgers has been altered because when i dined there i experienced one of the most dreadful hamburgers i have ever tasted prompting everyone at my table to return their meal the beef had a strong rancid flavor,0
undoubtedly this stands as the most appalling experience ive ever encountered at a movie theater my visit to see the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend quickly turned sour due to another family bringing their 15yearold child initially they seemed reasonably behaved but as time went on their ceaseless crying laughing and nonsensical talk disrupted the entire audience it is common knowledge that children will be children but it is utterly thoughtless to bring such young ones to a theater ruining the experience for everyone else adding insult to injury the theater employees showed no initiative in managing the situation resulting in the movie being completely spoiled i can confidently say that i will never step foot in that cinema again,0
layers offers a wonderful spot to pause and indulge in delicious baked goods and meals although it can be quite expensive and requires sacrificing a significant amount of money for my husband kids and me the ingredients are always fresh the staff is attentive and accommodating and its definitely a popular spot among locals,3
it truly astonishes me how this restaurant hasnt garnered a better rating my spouse and i are frequent visitors here and have never once been disappointed by our meals i wholeheartedly advise trying out their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles they truly hit the spot oh and dont miss out on their fries which are absolutely divine although i cant confirm if theyre made inhouse as for the appetizers the irish nachos and cheese curds didnt quite match our expectations except for that single instance when they served poutine which was a delightful surprise in my opinion this eatery stands amongst the cream of the crop when it comes to affordable dining options in madison moreover i truly appreciate that they provide an extensive menu featuring both burgers sandwiches and fullfledged entrees lastly one cannot overlook their efficient service ensuring that your food arrives promptly  perfect for those times when you arrive with ravenous hunger,4
among all the sushi places in las vegas my husband and i find this one to be our absolute favorite aside from nobu what sets it apart is the amazingly reasonable prices and the vast assortment of options available every dish served is fresh meticulously prepared and completely worth the cost usually we spend around 150 on sushi but remarkably the allyoucaneat deal is priced so well considering the amount we usually consume in my opinion it stands out as the best reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the entire city,4
rephrased statement 2 i must emphasize that my 200th review holds significant meaning making me particularly discerning of any informal text speak however setting that aside i cannot express enough how exceptional this dining experience was it was simply flawless beginning with the exquisite crab cakes accompanied by a dill remoulade and the mouthwatering macaroni and cheese that was both cheesy and satisfying both dishes offered great value at a reasonable price point next i insisted on trying the moules frites which exceeded my expectations the red curry sauce was genuinely outstanding and it is a musttry the fries were equally astonishing twicefried and served with an extraordinary mayo the provided baguette played a crucial role in savoring every drop of the delectable juices or perhaps even drying your tears as you uncontrollably weep in joyous culinary ecstasy to top off the whole experience enjoy a bottle of mark west pino noir priced at 25 this establishment comes highly recommended and i am deeply grateful to my brother and sisterinlaw for suggesting this hidden gem,4
solid burritos especially the carnitas burrito didnt try the tacos but they have a large menu will definitely be back a good alternative when i dont want to drive 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop very reasonable prices less than 5 for a good sized burrito my main concern is that i have always been the only customer come on and give it a try i dont want to see them go under,3
i am quite surprised that this restaurant doesnt have a higher rating my spouse and i frequent this place and have always had enjoyable meals i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the fries are also delicious although im unsure if they are made inhouse among the appetizers weve tried the irish nachos and cheese curds were not impressive except for one time when they had poutine available and it was amazing this is definitely one of the best affordable restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer both burgers and sandwiches as well as proper entrees additionally the food has consistently been served promptly which is a bonus when youre hungry upon arrival,4
for a considerable amount of time i had been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to try out this particular dining establishment to my disappointment however i found myself unimpressed with the overall experience the solitary positive aspect worth mentioning is the delectable sauce while every other meat option failed to deliver with its consistent dryness and lackluster taste fortunately the service was worthy of praise despite it being a monday although the prices seemed reasonable it would be more justified if the quality and flavor of the dishes were elevated among the trio of selections i sampled  brisket ribs and pulled pork  i can only credit the pulled pork for keeping my review from receiving a mere onestar rating,1
from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 i spent my time at this establishment due to obtaining a good deal we chose the standard luxury room for our stay arriving very late approximately 100 am on saturday morning we were granted a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite because they had exhausted their supply of standard luxury rooms it turned out to be delightful the le mans suite boasted exquisite decor and highquality furnishings the bathroom not only housed a spacious shower and a hot tub but also featured a bidet the only odd thing about the whole experience was the presence of an oldschool box tv despite that the room was otherwise remarkable,2
nestled away off the main road in corstorphine there is a quaint café that was previously known as cafe cibo and later rebranded as caffe citro due to its close proximity to my workplace it has become the top choice for lunch outings regrettably the quality of the food has taken a hit with each successive renovation of the café nonetheless the cakes have managed to retain their yummy factor however during my most recent visit i was left somewhat underwhelmed by the subpar sandwich i ordered for £350 the tuna sandwich made with cheap brown bread and accompanied by lackluster salad failed to meet my expectations in hindsight i should have opted for the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves exceptional tea and freshly baked treats onsite one of the cafes highlights is its delightful covered patio at the rear making it an ideal spot to unwind during the warmer months,1
i had a reservation from 06292012 to 07012012 and got a great deal on a standard luxury room however when we arrived late at around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a lemans suite since the hotel had run out of standard luxury rooms the suite looked amazing with its elegant decor highquality furniture fullsize shower hot tub and even a bidet the only odd thing was the presence of an oldfashioned box tv overall it was a fantastic room but i must say that the crowd at the hotel mostly older people might not make it as enjoyable for a group of friends or a bachelor party,2
ive lost count of how many times weve gathered our high school crew and embarked on the annual tradition of dining at this place over the years it never failed to provide us with a delectable feast worth remembering regrettably our most recent trip was far from impressive  it left all of us feeling utterly disappointed the steaks were unreasonably dry almost like they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended duration in terms of presentation it was atrocious to witness a dismal sight of charred meat sitting lifelessly on a stark white plate was disheartening personally i opted for the cajun ribeye only to be deeply dissatisfied by its arid rub parched texture and excessive charring our friends who ordered the filet also faced similar unpleasant experiences word on the street is that the restaurant is now under new management which might explain the rapid deterioration of what once used to be an outstanding steakhouse,0
i ventured to this place with the specific goal of indulging in an exquisite egg custard listed on their menu to my delight the custard turned out to be exceptionally delicious nevertheless there was a small drawback when it came to the fragility of the surrounding pastry shell—it proved rather soft and damp ultimately crumbling apart uncontrollably adding to my dining experience i also followed the proprietors advice and sampled both the coconut buns and custard buns moving forward id strongly suggest selecting the custard buns because the richness of the filling alone is enough to entice a return visit its regrettable that i lack the ability to award this establishment a greater number of stars the owner a pleasant lady who takes genuine pleasure in ensuring her patrons satisfaction goes above and beyond to help them find exactly what theyre searching for or make informed suggestions in pittsburgh if your cravings demand egg custard your options are unfortunately scarce,2
can you provide three different ways to express your thoughts about a restaurant i havent been to this place in over a year and it has deteriorated significantly since its prime every time i used to go there in 20122013 i hoped for the same excellence as it had before but it turned out to be mediocre at best however i still highly recommend their tasty dishes such as the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer the ambiance of the restaurant is also delightful although im not a huge sushi enthusiast this place really ignites my passion for it,2
my partner and i couldnt resist checking out this establishment despite driving past it countless times before our culinary adventure led us to savoring oysters calamari halibut and ahi all of which were rather delightful however my enthusiasm waned when i noticed the dining room housing a few cats since im not inclined towards these animals having them in close proximity to the food struck me as unsanitary,1
it brings me immense pleasure to come here during the weekdays at midday utilizing their free wifi service for studying or completing my work what i truly cherish about bdubs is their excellent feature of providing complimentary internet access usually i delve into my tasks while relishing a 6pack or a dozen boneless wings however resisting the temptation of enjoying a couple of beers while studying proves to be challenging resulting in occasional indulgence in a refreshing blue moon additionally the staff members are always welcoming and the atmosphere lends itself to great hangout sessions not surprisingly this attribute alone secures my loyalty with a 75 return rate,2
culinary dropout would receive a decent rating if the review focused solely on their food parking can be bothersome and its nice to be able to park and walk into a restaurant without dealing with valet parking however the noise level during our afternoon dining experience was unbearable as there was live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation its frustrating that people cant talk to each other at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud atmosphere to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and found the menu to be impressive offering a wide range of soups salads sandwiches and entrees there are also plenty of craft beer choices available if only the place were quieter we might consider giving it another try unfortunately the noise is simply too much for us we discussed this with some friends and they had the same observation if you enjoy the buzz of a noisy restaurant and valet parking then this is the perfect place for you but certainly not for us,1
rephrased statement 3 as my 200th review i do not take lightly the usage of informal text language but in all honesty this dining experience was truly one of my favorites in recent memory it was undeniably an outstanding dinner let me start by mentioning how the crab cakes were absolutely terrific with a dill remoulade and the macaroni and cheese was irresistibly gooey and delightful both dishes offered exceptional value at a reasonable price then came the moules frites which i wholeheartedly urge you to try the red curry sauce served with it is simply the best and please do not overlook the fries they were twice fried and accompanied by an astonishing mayo dont forget to make use of the baguette provided as it is essential for sopping up every bit of the flavorful sauces or perhaps even wiping away your tears of sheer pleasure induced by this gastronomic extravaganza for a perfect ending consider having a bottle of mark west pino noir for 25 which truly complements the evening this spot comes highly recommended and i would like to extend my gratitude to my brother and sisterinlaw for recommending this hidden culinary gem,4
during my visit from june 29th 2012 to july 1st 2012 we managed to find an excellent deal for a standard luxury room which prompted us to make a reservation despite our late arrival at around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised to find out that due to a lack of available standard luxury rooms we had been upgraded to a lemans suite free of charge the suite itself was visually impressive featuring tasteful decor and highquality furniture throughout the bathroom boasted both a fullsize shower and a hot tub as well as an unexpected addition  a bidet however its worth mentioning that the room did have an oldfashioned box tv which seemed out of place given the otherwise luxurious appearance its important to note that while the hotel is a suitable choice for couples or romantic getaways it may not cater to those looking for a lively atmosphere with friends or during a bachelor party,2
if our review were solely based on the food culinary dropout would receive a commendable rating regrettably the parking situation is inconvenient particularly with the bothersome valet service the most significant downfall however is the deafening noise experienced during our afternoon dining encounter attendees are subjected to live music playing at an overpowering volume causing everyone in the establishment to shout just to engage in conversation its disheartening that a restaurant lacks the atmosphere for people to connect through speech despite its extensive menu featuring enticing options like soups salads sandwiches and main entrees alongside a noteworthy variety of craft beers we are hesitant to give it a try due to the excessive noise levels confirming our thoughts with friends who shared the same perception it seems that unless you revel in the vibrant ambiance of a noisy eatery complete with valet parking services this place may not suit your preferences – much like ours,1
i had the most terrible 3hour experience of my life and i vow never to repeat it i would have preferred sleeping instead of enduring this ordeal i strongly advise against going through this its not worth it and a complete waste of a weekend getaway,0
we stayed at this hotel on sunday december 16 2012 to tuesday december 17 2012 the room we booked was the new grand king and our stay was for 2 nights the rate per night was 6320 including taxes and resort fees paid upon checkin we were pleasantly surprised by the modern rooms and renovations which exceeded our expectations compared to other hotels in its class like mirage and treasure island however its not a fair comparison to hard rock as weve always been upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower during our stays checking in at 2 am allowed us to skip any lines and the checkout process was convenient with the availability of cards next to the elevator,3
i ventured into the salon hoping for a quick manicure but ended up succumbing to their pitch to get gel nails instead with a price tag of 30 due to promises of extended durability unfortunately my experience took a downturn when the nails turned out to be unsightly appearing much thicker and more artificial compared to acrylic nails adding insult to injury they started peeling off within just a couple of days leaving me with no intention of revisiting that place,1
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we thought we wld try this place out on our last night in vegas nnupon walking up the pubber guys didnt even give me any of the girls get in free wristbands the first place not to now i consider myself a damn hott female so i dunno what his excuse was  needless to say  we stand in a hodgepodge of a line it was total chaos of the 5 bouncers no one seemed to have any rhyme or reason behind how they were choosing ppl to let in nmy boyfriend and i stood at the very front of the  line for about 40mins the bouncer wld choose ppl behind us next to usbut not us it wasnt long before i realized that the bouncer was choosing not to let us in  had no plans to anytime soon unless we tipped him big like others did nni also began to think he wasnt letting us in bc we were blackits 2011 dude get over urself nnafter about 45min we left it wasnt worth it to me to endure that crapand they werent even playing hiphop fail,0
at first i visited the salon with the purpose of receiving a rapid manicure session however the staff managed to persuade me into choosing gel nails despite their higher cost of 30 their main selling point was that these gel nails would last considerably longer than other options available regrettably upon closer inspection i noticed that the nails appeared excessively thick and had an unnatural appearance resembling poorly done acrylic nails furthermore it only took a few days before the nails began to peel off therefore i have decided that i will not be revisiting this salon again,1
i had the most dreadful 3 hours ever experienced and i vow never to repeat this again it would have been preferable for me to sleep rather than endure this ordeal i strongly advise against going through this as it is not worth it and a complete waste of a weekend getaway,0
my husband and i absolutely love this sushi place its our favorite aside from nobu the prices are unbelievably reasonable and they have a wide range of choices all of their dishes are fresh wellprepared and definitely worth the cost normally we spend around 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat option is surprisingly affordable for the amount we eat in my opinion its the best reasonablypriced sushi restaurant in las vegas,4
a primary source of enjoyment for me is dropping by this place in the afternoon throughout the week to work or study utilizing their complimentary wifi one thing i absolutely love about bdubs is the fact that they provide free wifi my typical routine involves ordering a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and immersing myself in my tasks however it can be quite tough to resist having a beer or two while studying so every now and then i give in and opt for a blue moon what makes the experience even better is the consistently friendly staff and the overall inviting atmosphere that lends itself perfectly to spending time there considering my satisfaction level theres a 75 probability that i will make a return visit,2
entering the salon with the intention of quickly getting a manicure i found myself swayed by their suggestion to opt for gel nails at a cost of 30 under the assurance of enhanced longevity regrettably what transpired was a disappointment upon discovering that the nails looked unnaturally bulky and fake surpassing the unattractiveness of acrylic nails altogether as if things couldnt get any worse they began to peel off within a mere few days solidifying my decision never to return,1
i really wish there was an alternative for zero stars when reviewing this place upon presenting my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to declare it as fraudulent and reject it contrary to their claims i am well aware that restaurantcom is a legitimate company as i have used their services without any issues numerous times before i even exhibited pictorial evidence of their featured restaurant on their website to our waitress but received no response with a baby on the way finances are tight which led us to dine there solely because of the certificate my hungry husband ordered nevertheless due to their dubious nature i adamantly refused to consume or drink anything served at this establishment,0
rephrased statement 1 on december 16 2012 my partner and i stayed for 2 nights in a newly renovated grand king room at a hotel that cost us 6320 per night after taxes we were pleasantly surprised by how modern the rooms were compared to other hotels of its class including mirage and treasure island however our experience at hard rock hotel in las vegas has always been superior as we were upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower each time we stayed there,3
my 200th review couldnt have been more memorable thanks to this remarkable dining experience the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were incredible offering a great balance of flavors the moules frites featuring a heavenly red curry sauce were a standout dish accompanied by exceptional fries and a necessary baguette completing the night with a bottle of mark west pinot noir truly elevated the evenings perfection i wholeheartedly recommend this gem and am thankful to my brother and sisterinlaw for introducing me to it,4
i was blown away by my 200th review dining experience the crab cakes paired with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were fantastic and reasonably priced the moules frites especially with the red curry sauce are a musttry dont miss out on the amazing fries and baguette either to top it all off a bottle of mark west pinot noir added the perfect touch to an incredible evening im grateful to my brother and sisterinlaw for recommending such a gem,4
we have been coming to this place once every year for the past decade with a bunch of our high school friends usually we would have an absolutely delicious meal but everyone was incredibly let down by our visit last weekend the steaks were so dry and tasted like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for quite some time moreover the way they were presented was awful  just a burnt piece of meat on a plain white plate personally i ordered the cajun ribeye but both the rub and the steak itself were horribly dry and overly charred our friends who ordered the filet also had similar disappointing experiences ive heard rumors that the restaurant is now under new ownership which might explain the sudden decline of what used to be a fantastic steakhouse,0
if the focus was solely on the food culinary dropout would receive a decent rating however the parking situation is troublesome its preferable to have the convenience of parking nearby without dealing with valet services additionally the dining experience is ruined by the excessive noise the live music and loud conversations make it impossible for patrons to comfortably converse with one another despite having an impressive menu with various options including soups salads sandwiches and main entrees as well as a wide selection of craft beer we would be willing to give this place a try if it were quieter unfortunately after confirming our observations with friends it seems that noise levels are consistently high if you enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of a noisy restaurant with valet parking then this establishment might suit your tastes but it certainly isnt our cup of tea,1
the moment i step into this place i instantly feel healthier—healthy enough to justify having cake for dinner i wont deny that im not the healthiest eater but being from vancouver where everything is organic its important for me to play the part having a bag of chia seeds at home that occasionally goes into smoothies eases my guilt when i indulge in corn flakes for dinner while dealing with emails does this mean ive finally reached adulthood however it doesnt mean that i dont enjoy treating myself to a meal that looks like it was made for grownups following a corn flake dinner with some organic almond yogurt truly brings balance to my life additionally i strongly believe in using biodegradable and clean household products to do my part in taking care of the planet when im not taking care of myself as well as i should this place fulfills several major aspects of my unique perspective on healthy living firstly it offers an impressive range of household items and is one of the few places that stocks multiple lines of personal care products such as burts bees and toothpaste thats good for you this store is a convenient onestop shop for all my bathroom and underthesink needs secondly it has nearly everything i need to justify indulging in unhealthy meals—from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically shouts look how healthy you are of course you can have ice cream for dinner however as many people have said adopting a healthy lifestyle—or in my case finding excuses for not doing so—can be expensive what i can say is that this place is cheaper than the similar stores back home and im thankful for that nevertheless compared to other options out there it will cost you a bit more my tip is if the price tag worries you remember that our beautiful blue and green planet needs all the help it can get even if you cant commit fully to eating good food organically spend a little extra on ecofriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo to keep harmful substances out of our drains then stock up on the hardertofind items or those you frequently use from this store and buy the rest from a cheaper place and lets not forget nothing beats genuine virgin organic coldpressed olive oil ill definitely make visits to this place from time to time to ensure i have all the essentials if only i could find a place in town where i could buy e3live then all the ingredients that justify my decadent habits would be complete,3
when it comes to burritos this place knows how to make them right especially the carnitas variety although i havent had the opportunity to taste their tacos their menu is quite diverse catering to various preferences i plan to become a regular as it offers a great alternative when i dont feel like making a long trip to my favorite burrito joint on top of that the prices are affordable  you can have a satisfying burrito for less than 5 nonetheless my main concern stems from the fact that i often find myself being the sole customer here come on join me in checking out this place and help support them before its too late,3
imagine this  a vibrantly colored shack that offers an astonishing array of flavored syrups lavishly poured over snowballs made from finelyshaved ice the shaved ice boasts of a remarkably wonderful texture and consistency that is a pure delight for your senses take your pick from an extensive selection of flavors ranging from bubblegum to sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste when it comes to sourness brace yourself for the grenade flavor  it will make your taste buds tingle with its intense sourness for those who yearn for a taste of the tropics the mai thai option beautifully captures the essence of the popular cocktail on the flip side be cautious with the cream soda flavor as it may not meet your expectations as the summer progresses pelicans fare promises to unveil more tantalizing options whats even better is that a mediumsized snowball only costs a budgetfriendly 2 and no need to worry about cash as they gladly accept card payments so if youve been oblivious to this fantastic find seize the moment and embark on a delightful journey by indulging in a frosty snowball on warm summer evenings following a rejuvenating rainstorm or at any time that suits your whims,3
rephrased statement 3 we decided to book a hotel in las vegas just before heading out and we managed to find a reasonably priced option that exceeded our low expectations we were used to staying at more upscale hotels but the newly renovated grand king room at this particular hotel surprised us with its modernity compared to other hotels in the same category such as mirage and treasure island we would definitely rate this one higher although our experiences at the hard rock hotel have also been great its important to note that we have always been upgraded to the magnificent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower making it an unfair comparison,3
my first dish at enzos was their chicken parm lunch special for just 10 you receive a salad drink garlic knots and gelato they offer around seven specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and more this price point makes it the best lunch deal for miles around since that initial visit i have tried various pasta dishes as well as the lasagna and they were all delightful the chicken parm and the lasagna stand out as exceptional options while the pasta itself is good it could benefit from additional oil and sauce since the portion tends to be slightly undersauced moreover the garlic knots are generally enjoyable although there are instances when they become overcooked and fail to match the perfection of those moist garlicinfused ones as for the gelato it is simply marvelous and supposedly made locally  rich creamy and an ideal conclusion to the meal,3
i cant express how awful those 3 hours were truly the lowest point of my life i promise myself that i will never subject myself to such an ordeal again i should have chosen to rest and sleep rather than enduring that misery i implore everyone out there to avoid this at all costs its a total waste of time and ruins what could have been a relaxing weekend getaway,0

this sushi joint is both my husbands and my top pick second only to nobu the prices here are incredibly reasonable and they offer an extensive variety of options every dish comes fresh and perfectly prepared truly justifying its price generally we spend about 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option at such a great price is quite remarkable considering what we consume personally i believe its the finest yet reasonably priced sushi spot in las vegas,4
this small café tucked away off the main road in corstorphine was previously known as cafe cibo and later renamed caffe citro due to its close proximity to my workplace it has become the preferred lunch spot for many people unfortunately with each refurbishment the quality of the food has somewhat dwindled while the cakes still remain quite tasty i couldnt help but feel disappointed by the subpar quality of the sandwich during my last visit it was a tuna sandwich priced at £350 made with lowquality brown bread and accompanied by a lackluster salad in hindsight opting for the spinach tart would have been a better choice notwithstanding the original coffee bean continues to offer excellent options for tea lovers including freshly baked cakes moreover the café boasts a charming covered patio at the back providing an idyllic setting to enjoy the warmer months,1

no doubt about it my trip to the movie theater became an utterly terrible experience together with my girlfriend we eagerly decided to watch the hobbit battle of five armies unaware of the disruptive situation awaiting us a family chose to accompany their 15yearold child creating chaos throughout the screening at first they remained relatively quiet but as time passed their ceaseless crying laughter and babbling completely overshadowed the peaceful ambiance i understand that children will be children yet it is inconsiderate to expose such young ones to a theater environment compromising the enjoyment of the entire audience making matters worse the theater employees showed absolute negligence by failing to address this issue consequently the movie experience was utterly ruined for me and i can firmly say that i will never return,0
the fact that this restaurant does not boast a higher rating truly surprises me considering how often my husband and i dine here and the consistently pleasant experiences weve had i expected it to be more highly regarded allow me to endorse their entire selection of burgers the delightful pot roast balls and the mouthwatering chicken and waffles the fries also deserve a special mention for being particularly scrumptious though i cannot confirm whether they are made inhouse among the appetizers weve tried the irish nachos and cheese curds failed to leave a lasting impression lacking that wow factor however on one occasion they served poutine and it was absolutely outstanding in my opinion this establishment ranks among the best affordable restaurants in madison i genuinely appreciate their diverse menu offering an assortment of burgers sandwiches and proper entrees additionally the punctuality with which they serve their food has consistently been commendable which is especially gratifying when one arrives famished,4
i am hoping they have changed their meat in the burgers because when i ate there it was one of the worst hamburgers i have ever had  everyone at the table sent their food back  the meat tasked rancid,0
my wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh which is about 10 years  this is our goto chinese restaurant even after we moved out of the neighborhood  i have never had a bad meal here and i will forever love their beef chow fun  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most  these are great folks and i wish them the best of success in the future  remember everyone just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad  some people just have lousy taste buds and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with  try things for yourself and you will find some great food at tasty,4
since i love their food 80 of the time i was nice enough to give them 2 stars but after tonight i highly doubt i will return they are losing so much business now that i will not be promoting their outrageously poor serviced staff and making their food a million times spicier than what it usually sits at  i ordered to go as usual and i had bad feeling about it since it was almost 9pm when they close i called and the lady was oh so nice enough to say we are closing in 5 minutes no shit sherlock like i didnt already know i am not that dumb by boyfriend decided super last minute that he wanted thai ugh so i knew they were going to ruin our food so badly that i am sitting here typing this instead of eating the delicious panang curry but it is so damn hot that i cant even eat it and can barely stand even the underlying flavor  this was extremely dissapointing because i love their food and now with the service and horrid food given the past two times i will not be returning i can tell you that much right now   i can bet anyone 5 dollars that with all the reviews regarding their downward spiral of bad service that the owner or manager doesnt give a rats ass that they are doing this bad now  i remember when we went to the tempe location they have a white racist broad that used a different race as an excuse for the spice level oh the other cook that made your food is mexican seriously what if i was mexican i would have called the highest up manager i could get  completely and utterly irrelevant just make my food the way it is supposed to be made is that so hard to ask for honestly nnso as of 51512 i give them only 1 extra star for giving me a brand new panang curry that was good enough for me only problem is there was a younger kid that drew a red heart around my new order slip and wrote his name on typed his name in the top right corner with a winking face i noticed it as i walked out and just oh for gods sakes really i just spoke to this kid about how the food was unbearable to my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
the idea of enjoying hiphop music on a sunday led us to choose this destination for our final night in vegas unfortunately upon arriving at the entrance the bouncers failed to provide us with the free wristbands meant for girls this quickly baffled me given that i perceive myself as an attractive woman as if it couldnt get worse outside the venue we encountered a chaotic line where five bouncers seemed to arbitrarily select individuals for entry without any discernible criteria despite standing at the front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer consistently ignored us while granting access to those positioned behind or beside us it soon became evident that unless we offered him a substantial tip like others did he had no intention of allowing us in at this point i started pondering whether our race might have influenced his decision disregarding that it was already 2011 after enduring this mistreatment for around 45 minutes we ultimately decided to call it quits as it simply wasnt worth it particularly since they werent even playing hiphop music,0
first the plusses  orchids garden offers dim sum all day not just during the morning and lunch hours  its inexpensive  two of us staggered out for 18 including tax and a generous tipnthe minuses  its way too far away from my apartment near unlv  as in too many transfers too long a bus ride  the dim sum was okay  we had a variety of dishes but nothing was superbnthe neithergoodnorbad  orchids garden also has americanstyle chinese food chow mein sweet and sour something  i saw an anglo couple im anglo too with those kinds of dishes on their table  there were also plenty of asians eating dim sum or real chinese food  if i were going out for chinese food with a very mixed group which would be my classmates or my former colleagues this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking,2
for the past 10 years our group of high school friends has been making an annual visit to this place which used to provide us with consistently enjoyable meals however our recent experience last weekend was a complete letdown the steaks were dry and tasted as if they had been left under a heat lamp for an extended period moreover the presentation was unappealing with the meat appearing nothing more than a burnt chunk on an unadorned white plate i opted for the cajun ribeye but the rub lacked moisture the steak itself was parched and it was overly charred similarly my companions filets failed to meet expectations it seems that the decline in quality could be attributed to the restaurant being under new ownership,0
we have been coming to this place annually for the past decade with a group of friends from high school usually we have a really good meal but our visit last weekend left everyone extremely disappointed the steaks were dry and seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time the presentation was awful with just a slab of charred meat on a plain white plate i specifically ordered the cajun ribeye but the rub was dry the steak was dry as well and it was excessively charred my friends had the filet with similar disappointing results i heard that there are new owners now so maybe thats why this once great steakhouse has taken a steep plunge,0
i wish there was a no stars option do not come here i came with a restaurantcom gift certificate and they had the nerve to tell me that restaurantcom is a fraudulent company and that they wont accept my gift certificate because its a scam i for one know that restaurantcom is a legit company that i have used several times their restaurant has been featured on their site for years which i proceeded to show my waitress on my phone but she had no response  money is tight with a baby on the way and we only went there because i had this certificate my husband ordered because he was starving but i refused to eat or drink anything from this establishment because they are the ones that are fraudulent  these people are shady and food is mediocre at best hardly any filling in the pupusas and the wait is ridiculous,0
one day while hanging out with my buddies they proposed trying an italian restaurant although i adore italian cuisine finding good italian food in las vegas can be as challenging as discovering a stripper who hasnt tasted charlie sheens tongue or doesnt know the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint its not impossible just too much effort to bother,3
those were without a doubt the most terrible 3 hours of my existence i can guarantee that i will never subject myself to this again i would much rather have spent that time sleeping instead of enduring such torture i implore you not to go through this as it is truly not worthwhile and will only result in wasting your precious weekend escape,0
without question this was the most horrible encounter ive had at a cinema my girlfriend and i watched the hobbit battle of five armies when a family brought their 15yearold child along they were somewhat quiet for the first hour but then they started incessantly crying laughing and babbling disrupting everyones experience i acknowledge that kids will be kids but taking such young children to a theater is inconsiderate and ruins it for others whats worse the theater employees didnt take any action ultimately destroying the movie and ensuring i never return,0
it is my desire that they have made adjustments to the type of meat present in their hamburgers due to the fact that the burger i tasted on my last visit was exceedingly dreadful  every individual sitting with me at the table had their food returned as the taste of the meat was foul,0
i find it genuinely surprising that this restaurants rating isnt higher my partner and i are regular patrons and have never encountered a subpar meal there if you ask me their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles are all worth recommending and lets not forget about their fries which are really tasty although i cant confirm whether they are homemade or not as for the appetizers we havent been impressed with the irish nachos or cheese curds except for the one time they served poutine  that was fantastic in my opinion this is one of the topnotch affordable dining options in madison i particularly like that they offer both burgers and sandwiches along with fullfledged main courses on top of that their service is commendable ensuring that your food arrives promptly when youre feeling famished,4
orchids garden provides dim sum throughout the day offering great value for money however its location poses a challenge for me as it involves multiple transfers and a lengthy bus ride from my apartment near unlv while the quality of the dim sum was satisfactory it didnt stand out the restaurant also serves americanstyle chinese food attracting a diverse clientele that includes both angloamericans and asians,2
after passing it numerous times my partner and i finally decided to give this place a try we savored a variety of dishes including oysters calamari halibut and ahi and found them to be quite enjoyable overall nonetheless the presence of cats in the dining room left me feeling uneasy as someone who isnt fond of cats and values cleanliness i find their proximity to the food to be unhygienic,1
we had heard that this place plays hiphop on sundays so we decided to give it a try for our last night in vegas however when we approached the bouncers they didnt give us any of the free wristbands meant for girls i couldnt understand why considering i consider myself an attractive woman the line outside was chaotic with no clear criteria for who was getting in despite being at the front of the line for about 40 minutes the bouncer consistently chose people behind and next to us but not us it became evident that he had no intention of letting us in unless we tipped him a significant amount like others did at this point i started to wonder if race played a factor since it was 2011 after approximately 45 minutes we decided to leave because it wasnt worth enduring such unnecessary hassle especially when they werent even playing hiphop,0
i cannot stress enough how much i loved my 200th review experience at this restaurant the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were both delicious and satisfying the moules frites with red curry sauce were outstanding along with the fries and baguette provided ending the evening with a bottle of mark west pinot noir made it a perfect dinner i highly recommend this hidden gem thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for suggesting it,4
the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times had the oysters calamari halibut and ahi everything was pretty good the only thing i wasnt a fan of were the cats in the dining room im not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary,1
without a doubt my visit to the movie theater turned out to be the most dreadful experience ever my girlfriend and i excitedly headed to see the hobbit battle of five armies only to have our enjoyment disrupted by a family who brought their 15yearold child with them initially they were somewhat wellbehaved but as time went on the childs nonstop crying laughter and babbling became unbearable none of these noises were even remotely silent while i acknowledge that children will be children it is crucial not to bring such young kids to the theater and ruin the experience for everyone else what made matters worse was that the theater staff did absolutely nothing about it such a scenario completely ruined the movie for me and i am certain i will never return,0
layers is a good place to stop off and enjoy bakery items and food  its pricey and to take my hubby and family costs an arm and a leg  ingredients are fresh  staff is helpful  its definitely a local hangout,3
in case you havent heard yet theres this fantastic shack that has become the talk of the town step inside its captivating charm where youll find yourself surrounded by vibrant colors and appetizing aromas one look at their menu and youll realize that they have nailed the art of serving refreshing treats their secret the perfect texture and consistency of finely shaved ice differentiating it from other forms of ice preparations be prepared to embark on a taste adventure with flavors ranging from childhood favorites like bubblegum to tangy delights like sour apple and cola dont shy away from more unconventional options like mai thai or toothpaste if you want to challenge your taste buds oh and about cream soda  its a miss dont forget for an incredibly affordable price of just 2 you can enjoy all this goodness so why werent you aware of this hidden gem maybe its time to hop in your car and experience the joy of savoring a snowball on a summer evening after a refreshing rainstorm or better yet seize the opportunity whenever you feel like treating yourself,3
i initially entered the salon with the intention of a speedy manicure but after being persuaded by the staff i ended up getting gel nails that came at a price of 30 i had been assured that these gel nails would have a longer lifespan than normal however upon observation i found that the nails were excessively thick and had an artificial appearance even more so than acrylic nails to make matters worse the nails began peeling off just a few days later as a result i have decided not to return to this salon,1
looking purely at the culinary aspect culinary dropout deserves a decent rating nevertheless parking can be a major hassle especially when valet services are involved what makes matters worse is the unbearable level of noise during the afternoon dining experience with live music playing and everyone in the vicinity shouting just to communicate engaging in conversation becomes a constant struggle its disheartening to see a restaurant where people cannot even connect through speech while the eatery offers an intriguing range of dishes like soups salads sandwiches and main entrees along with an impressive selection of craft beers the excessive noise prevents us from giving it a chance our friends have also reported similar experiences if you happen to adore the lively ambiance of a clamorous restaurant combined with valet parking then this venue could be right up your alley however it definitely does not match our preferences,1
the food here is outstanding and it is definitely a great choice for a family outing primarily because my children truly enjoy it,4
there is no doubt that this was the absolute worst experience i have ever had at a movie theater while enjoying the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend we were unfortunate enough to have a family bring their 15yearold child initially they remained relatively quiet but after a while there was constant crying laughter and senseless chatter none of it was on the quieter side i understand that kids will be kids but if they are that young please refrain from bringing them to a theater and spoiling everyone elses enjoyment to make matters worse the theater staff completely neglected the situation resulting in the film being ruined i swear i will never step foot in that place again,0
the quality of the food at this establishment is fantastic making it a perfect spot to bring the whole family my kids are huge fans,4
went in looking for a quick manithey convinced me to get gel nails which cost 30 because i was told they would last longer  the problem was the nails looked too thick and fakeworse than acrylicsand then they started peeling off after a  couple days will not be going back,1
there is genuine delight in my regular visits to this establishment during weekdays afternoons as it allows me to concentrate on my studies or professional obligations all thanks to the free wifi available one of the aspects i treasure most about bdubs is its provision of complimentary internet connectivity typically i opt for a 6pack or a dozen boneless wings to accompany my endeavors striving to stay focused however every now and then succumbing to the allure of a few beers while working becomes irresistible therefore i treat myself to a blue moon the amiable staff and wonderful environment provided further contribute to making it an excellent spot for spending quality time consequently my likelihood of coming back stands at an impressive 75,2
the reason behind this venue attaining a fourstar rating remains unclear to me since i possess discerning tastes when it pertains to pho whether attributed to my vietnamese background or the irreplaceable quality of my mothers pho regrettably the service provided at this establishment is abysmal despite the food being fairly commendable we waited for a considerable 20 minutes merely to be served water and handed menus once we finally received the menus the staff immediately pressured us to place our orders without granting us sufficient time to peruse them could i possibly have a moment to review my menu before deciding for my choice i opted for the rice dish with bbq pork also known as com suon nuong which proved to be delectable however it was disheartening that my family members who ordered the pho had to endure a longer waiting period and only received their meals once i had completely finished mine additionally my thai tea was predominantly comprised of ice rather than the actual tea were it not for the presence of my family i would not contemplate revisiting this establishment,1
the solid burritos particularly the carnitas burrito stood out for me while i cannot comment on the quality of their tacos i must say that their menu is extensive and has something for everyone this spot will undoubtedly be my goto when i dont want to travel far to satisfy my burrito cravings given its affordable prices and generous portion sizes under 5 per burrito my primary concern though is the limited customer base since i always find myself alone join me in giving this place a try and preventing it from going out of business,3
if youre looking for a great place to make a pit stop and savor some mouthwatering bakery treats and savory cuisine look no further than layers admittedly it comes with a hefty price tag to take along your partner and entire family nevertheless you can always count on the quality of their ingredients coupled with the helpfulness of the staff who will ensure your visit exceeds expectations its truly a beloved gathering spot within the community,3
