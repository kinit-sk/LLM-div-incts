we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
initially i must express my lack of enthusiasm towards buffets however due to receiving a 50 credit during our stay at monte carlo in las vegas i decided to give it a try as my friend insisted although the flavors were satisfactory the limited food selection and mediocre service failed to alter my perception about buffets,0

the service is incredibly bad at that particular venue and as a result i have absolutely no desire to ever step foot there again it somewhat resembles another place with similarly subpar conditions,0
seeking a unique experience that differs from ordinary sports clips or generic barbershops look no further than this hidden gem in charlotte the talented barbers not only know how to expertly cut hair but also ensure a fun and entertaining environment with their mastery of shapeups fades and tapeups stumbling upon this place has been an absolute delight for me,3
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0

to summarize this type of asian food can be described as decent but salty with sauces and meat that have a canned taste it is comparable in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores yet it carries a higher price tag,1
its mediocre lacking any standout elements and offering limited seafood options essentially resembling the typical asian buffets found throughout the city,1
apart from not putting my antenna back on the first time they efficiently complete the job within 20 minutes,2
around midnight my buddies and i decided to check out this dennys place the atmosphere was good and our server was quite amiable although i opted not to eat anything my friends did and unfortunately their stomachs felt queasy afterwards,0
while these bagels are acceptable i must admit that their beverages are quite delightful i particularly have a fondness for the blackberry lemonade as for the interior it may lack character but it does provide comfort with air conditioning and impeccably clean bathrooms given its presence on state street this fact holds great significance,2

cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
if you find the rolls to be underwhelming and insignificant my suggestion would be to treat yourself to the delightful seabass appetizer instead,2
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
our dinner experience tonight was extremely unsatisfactory—the steaks served at our table were all improperly cooked except for the crab that was perfectly prepared its quite disheartening when a steakhouse fails to deliver on their main specialty,0
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
its average at best without any noteworthy elements the selection of seafood is limited rendering it indistinguishable from the rest of the asian buffets in the area,1
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited dining options the taste of the food was average and did not justify the price or the service provided however i was content with the fact that everything was kept clean,1
although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
experience delectable cuisine at highly affordable rates with dinner costing an average of around 25 per person however brace yourself for subpar customer service and inefficiency dont be surprised if you find yourself having to request drink refills napkins and even your bill multiple times curiously enough the cashier didnt hesitate to question the absence of a tip disregarding the fact that they had not provided any satisfactory service,2
no longer the human bean,2
this particular venue has become a favorite spot for my family gettogethers however i havent experienced a single meal here that has left me genuinely impressed while the service is satisfactory my overall contentment upon departure is always lacking,1
i will never return to that place because their service is extremely poor its similar to another establishment that also had unsatisfactory offerings,0
consistently i have positive encounters in this place,3
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
the bagels are satisfactory but i find their beverages to be delicious personally i enjoy the blackberry lemonade the ambiance is a bit sterile yet it offers air conditioning and wellmaintained restrooms considering its location on state street this speaks volumes,2
when im in las vegas i always want to visit this place for a latenight bite the food is decent the servings are substantial and the prices are reasonable considering its vegas its spacious enough to accommodate big groups and i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory i really enjoy this place because they have a wide variety of food options including tasty breakfast items,3
toprated obstetriciangynecologists,4
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
the service was extremely amicable and the food exceeded our expectations we opted for the gyro and found it to be on par with any other place despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing time the food remained fresh and did not have a stale taste the only drawback was the absence of any greens in the wrap without a doubt i would return to dine at this establishment,3
every time im in vegas i feel an urge to check out this spot for a midnight snack the quality of their food is acceptable and you definitely get your moneys worth with their generous portions which are reasonably priced compared to other places in vegas it has ample space for larger parties and interestingly i think it shares ownership with the cheesecake factory what sets this place apart is the diverse selection of dishes available including a satisfying breakfast menu,3
you wont be disappointed by the quality of the vegetarian dishes particularly the scrumptious spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries,3
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
the vegetarian cuisine is exceptional especially the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the scrumptious chili fries,3
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
our acquisition of a 9stage system has delighted us as it skillfully equalizes the ph level of the reverse osmosis water in addition the affordably priced highquality equipment surpasses our expectations and the american origin further enhances its desirability compared to products manufactured in china,4
you can continuously expect great encounters in this establishment,3
is the chick matts hog vouched for worth the extended wait with a thumbs up,4
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings at a restaurant although they were tasty they were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but a bit slow although the staff did bring me extra ranch dressing for free which was nice considering many places charge extra one notable aspect of this place is the numerous tvs scattered around making it an ideal spot for watching sports games,2
i have a deep affection for this establishment and i genuinely wish they had a presence in california whenever i find myself in arizona i make it a point to visit at least 23 times due to their consistently outstanding cuisine impeccable cleanliness and incredibly gracious and helpful staff members,4
the store was bustling with customers but the service was sluggish due to insufficient staff members which resulted in a delay in getting my car battery replaced after they effectively honored the warranty in less than 5 minutes of searching for it,1
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to experience the taste of the mediumsized traditional chicken wings offered at a nearby eatery although satisfying enough they simply fell into the realm of being average as for the service it was efficient but unhurried however what stood out positively was the fact that the server generously provided me with extra ranch dressing free of charge a gesture not commonly witnessed as other establishments typically tack on an additional cost for such addons adding to the allure this establishment boasted an impressive collection of one hundred televisions making it an optimal destination for sports aficionados longing to catch exciting live matches,2
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
you can expect incredibly reasonable prices for great food averaging about 25 per person during dinner hours yet be prepared for mediocre customer service and delays as you might have to repeatedly ask for drink refills napkins and your bill interestingly the cashier went so far as to inquire about the lack of tip seemingly oblivious to the inadequate level of service provided,2
the dinner we had tonight was the most disappointing ever—the steaks on our table were all incorrectly cooked except for the crab which was the only thing done right thats definitely not what youd expect from a steakhouse,0
we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this accommodation due to the exceptionally comfortable beds advantageous location complimentary wifi available parking facilities and the added convenience of an aroundtheclock open pool and hot tub what impressed us even more was the attentiveness of the housekeepingsecurity team who quickly retrieved a misplaced cell phone on our behalf based on this excellent experience we have every intention of returning,3
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
gathering at this establishment is a tradition for my family although i have yet to encounter a meal that i truly found enjoyable while the service is commendable i find myself consistently dissatisfied upon departure,1
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
whenever i find myself in sin city i cant resist stopping by this establishment for a latenight treat the food here is surprisingly tasty and the portion sizes are incredibly large which is quite uncommon for las vegas considering the citys reputation for high prices this place offers reasonable rates making it even more appealing it boasts plenty of space to accommodate large gatherings and funnily enough i believe its under the same ownership as the popular cheesecake factory one aspect that i particularly like about this place is the extensive range of food choices including a delicious breakfast spread,3
if you dont have a spot on the guest list or have an ample bust getting into this ultra exclusive los angeles nightclub known for its snobbishness is nearly impossible  seriously so essentially the general line turns out to be more of a queue where each person has to pay 50 or use their attire as a means to stand out leaving only men still waiting outside,0
we encountered an unimpressive attitude from one of the female employees and the restaurant had a limited selection of dishes to offer the taste of the food was mediocre falling short of justifying the cost and quality of both service and cuisine nonetheless i took comfort in the fact that the premises were wellmaintained,1
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
although seafood isnt usually my preference i made an exception for my husbands birthday as he has a strong liking for it thankfully the restaurant offered alternative choices that brought me joy and my husband expressed delight with his seafood dish,4
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
the 9stage system we invested in has exceeded our expectations by effectively maintaining the ph balance in our purified water from reverse osmosis notably the price point for this highgrade equipment is remarkably competitive making it one of the best choices available additionally knowing that it originates from the united states as opposed to china adds a distinct sense of gratification,4
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
firstly i want to clarify that i am not particularly fond of buffetstyle meals however upon receiving a generous 50dollar credit as part of our stay at monte carlo in las vegas i agreed to try it out as my friend was keen on the idea although the taste of the food was acceptable the limited range of choices and unsatisfactory service did not succeed in altering my unfavorable perception of buffets,0
among the superior choices the crab legs and shrimp stood out amidst enjoyment yet failed to match the caliber of the cosmopolitan,2
would you say that the excessively long wait makes the chick endorsed by matts hog valuable with a thumbs up gesture,4
simply put this typical snobby kind of nightclub found in the heart of los angeles operates under strict rules when it comes to granting access if your name isnt already on the highly coveted reservation list or if you lack the proportions that draw attention chances are you wont be able to get inside – no exaggeration in reality the supposed general waiting line quickly transforms into a costly process charging 50 per person or resorting to dressing provocatively in hopes of gaining favor the end result predominantly men remaining on the outside unable to enter,0
is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
the beds are comfortable the location is good there is free wifi and parking and a 247 open pool and hot tub we accidentally left our cell phone in the room but fortunately the housekeepingsecurity staff found it for us i would definitely go back,3
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
the service at that place is so terrible i have no intention of ever going there again it reminds me of another place with equally disappointing experiences,0
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
at around 1130 pm we decided to visit a dennys restaurant with my pals initially everything went smoothly our waiter was exceptionally pleasant while i refrained from eating anything regrettably my friends who consumed meals ended up feeling sick afterwards,0
highest recommended obgyns,4
the service was extremely friendly and the food pleasantly exceeded our expectations we ordered the gyro and found it to be just as delicious as any other place weve tried despite arriving only 5 minutes before closing time the food tasted fresh and not at all stale the only downside was that there was no green salad included in the wrap overall i would highly consider returning to dine here,3
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
to begin with let me state that buffets are not my preferred choice for dining nonetheless since we received a 50dollar credit for staying at monte carlo in las vegas and my friend expressed interest in trying it out i decided to give it a chance despite the decent taste of the dishes offered the lack of variety in food options and subpar service did little to change my negative opinion about buffets,0
friendly staffclean,3
who are the most trusted obgyn specialists available,4
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
rather than choosing the disappointing small rolls why not indulge yourself with the delicious seabass appetizer instead,2
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
it is decent but not extraordinary with a limited selection of seafood that closely resembles the offerings of other asian buffets nearby,1
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
if youre looking for superb vegetarian fare you must try the wonderfully tasty spicy po boy and the incredibly satisfying chili fries,3
with the exception of forgetting to reattach my antenna initially their work is commendable and they complete it in just 20 minutes,2
dont bother with the small rolls theyre not worth it choose the seabass appetizer instead,2
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
gathering with my family is a tradition at this location although i am yet to find a dish that truly tickles my fancy the service provided is acceptable but unfortunately my satisfaction level remains unfulfilled upon leaving,1
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3
seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
the adoration i hold for this location knows no bounds if only they expanded to california without fail whenever im in arizona i make frequent trips here often at least 23 times the food is consistently amazing the environment remains pristine and the staff exemplify kindness and excellence,4
except for the incident where they failed to reinstall my antenna on the initial occasion their service is impeccable completing the task swiftly in a mere 20 minutes,2
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
without fail my experiences here are always delightful,3
this place has captured my heart and i truly yearn for its presence in california every time i find myself in arizona i ensure that i visit an impressive minimum of 23 times the delectable dishes never disappoint the ambiance is constantly clean and inviting and the staff deliver remarkable service coupled with warmheartedness,4
had enough of the usual sports clips or runofthemill barbershops look no further let this exceptional establishment be your next destination the barbers here possess an impressive ability to artfully cut hair while providing a lively and enjoyable setting they specialize in precise shapeups impeccable fades and flawless tapeups finding this delightful place in charlotte has brought immense joy to my life,3
the service at the restaurant left much to be desired and the food was extremely unsatisfactory not only was my breakfast plate covered in excessive grease causing it to slide around but the egg on it was also not fully cooked unfortunately the experience extended to the drinks as well with the mimosa being the most terrible one ive ever tasted disappointed i decided to send it back and opted for a simple coffee instead,0
one of the more satisfying options i relished the crab legs and shrimp however they did not quite measure up to the excellence of the cosmopolitan,2
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
the service provided by one of the ladies was unsatisfactory and there were only a few food choices available the flavor of the food was average at best and did not match the price charged or the level of service received nevertheless i found solace in the fact that they maintained cleanliness,1
in short this is the savory kind of asian cuisine with cannedtasting sauces and meat its comparable to frozen dinners from the grocery store but more expensive,1
if you dont have a spot on the waitlist or arent wellendowed getting into this typical pretentious la nightclub will be impossible in reality the regular line is just a lineup where people pay 50 per person or rely on wearing a short dress to stand out leaving only the men who werent able to get in,0
during a notsobusy wednesday night i opted for the medium variant of the classic chicken wings at a local establishment while the flavors were pleasing and met expectations they didnt exceed them the service though slow was acceptable and to my delight i received complimentary additional ranch dressing something that is commonly subject to an extra fee elsewhere furthermore the sheer abundance of televisions present within the venue created an ideal setting for avid sports enthusiasts seeking to enjoy their favorite games,2
the vegetarian food is exceptional the spicy po boy and chili fries are both incredibly delicious,3
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
are you looking for a change from regular sports clips and typical barbershops if so try going to this place in charlotte where the barbers are skilled at cutting hair and creating a lively atmosphere they excel at shapeups fades and tapeups making it a great discovery for me,3
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
while i typically dont enjoy seafood i decided to make an exception on my husbands special day it was his birthday after all and he absolutely adores seafood luckily the restaurant had nonseafood options that satisfied me and my husband couldnt stop praising his delectable choice,4
although average it doesnt offer anything exceptional or abundant seafood choices ultimately sharing similarities with other asian buffets in the area,1
we dont really fancy dryaged meat as it often has a rancid taste but the side dishes at this place are decent enough with nothing extraordinary to talk about or go back for,1
describing it succinctly this type of asian cuisine presents a savory experience featuring cannedtasting sauces and meat its quality is reminiscent of frozen dinners found in grocery stores albeit at a greater cost,1

every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
despite the bustling activity at the store the service was slowpaced as there werent enough employees present causing a 30minute delay in the simple task of replacing my car battery even though they efficiently handled the warranty claim within 5 minutes,1
i absolutely adore this location its such a shame that they dont have branches in california every time im in arizona i make sure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently fantastic the ambiance is pristine and the staff members are exceptionally friendly and generous,4
exceptionally delicious vegetarian dishes include the flavorful spicy po boy and the delectable chili fries,3

wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
dryaged meat doesnt impress us much it usually has a spoiled flavor in our opinion however the side options at this establishment are acceptable without any standout dishes worth getting excited over or revisiting,1
with numerous customers flooding the busy store the service became inefficent and timeconsuming due to the lack of adequate staffing resulting in a swift resolution for my car battery warranty in under 5 minutes but an additional half an hour needed to simply replace it,1
my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
we purchased a 9stage system which impressively equalizes the ph level of our reverse osmosis water not only are the prices highly competitive for topnotch equipment but it is also worth noting that it is manufactured in the united states instead of china,4
tonights dinner experience was highly disappointing as all the steaks served at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab which was the lone exception such poor performance is definitely unsatisfactory for a reputable steakhouse,0
though seafood isnt generally my cup of tea i set aside my preferences to celebrate my husbands birthday in style knowing his deep affection for seafood we chose a place where he could indulge fortunately the restaurant catered to diverse tastes offering other enticing options that put a smile on my face my husband too was extremely pleased with his delectable seafood selection,4
we received exceptionally warm and welcoming service and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food opting for the gyro we couldnt help but compare its taste to other establishments finding it equally enjoyable despite arriving a mere 5 minutes prior to closing the food maintained a fresh flavor without any hints of staleness our sole concern was the absence of greens in the wrap without hesitation i would gladly revisit this place for a meal,3
the vegetarian cuisine is absolutely fantastic especially the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the delectable chili fries,3
with their cozy beds ideal location complimentary wifi ample parking space and roundtheclock availability of a pool and hot tub this place had everything we needed for a pleasant stay moreover the responsible housekeepingsecurity personnel went above and beyond by locating and returning a forgotten cell phone needless to say i wouldnt hesitate to come back,3

the experience is satisfactory but not exceptional there isnt a wide variety of seafood options available making it quite similar to the other asian buffets in town,1
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
statement 1 the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks were absolutely dreadful  the mimosa i ordered was the worst ive ever had i ended up returning it and opting for a coffee instead,0
instead of opting for the small and unsatisfying rolls i recommend trying out the seabass appetizer which is much more enjoyable,2
although the bagels here are decent i personally find their drink selection to be scrumptious the blackberry lemonade is a particular favorite of mine while the interior might come across as sterile it does offer a reprieve from the heat with air conditioning and maintains spotless bathrooms especially considering its location on bustling state street these features are highly commendable,2
within the realm of delightful alternatives my preference leaned towards savoring the crab legs and shrimp although still falling short in comparison to the excellence of the cosmopolitan,2
the dinner we had tonight was a disaster  every steak at our table was improperly cooked with the only redeeming factor being the correctly prepared crab thats certainly not what you expect from a steakhouse,0
it was on a wednesday night that i made my way to a notsobusy restaurant at this establishment i decided to go for the medium traditional wings which turned out to be fairly enjoyable but nothing extraordinary the service provided was good overall despite being somewhat sluggish to my surprise i received complimentary extra ranch dressing which is usually subject to an additional charge at other places notably this venue boasts an impressive collection of around one hundred television screens making it an attractive destination for catching live sporting events,2
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt very crowded i decided to indulge in some mediumsized traditional wings which were quite enjoyable although they were just ordinary in taste the service was satisfactory but a bit sluggish however the staff pleasantly surprised me by providing extra ranch without any additional charge most places usually make you pay for it what made this place even more appealing was the vast number of tvs it had making it an excellent spot to catch live games,2
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
unless you happen to be on the vip list or possess a noticeable physical attribute gaining entry into this pretentious la club can be quite the challenge in all honesty the regular admission line is basically just a long lineup where each individual needs to shell out 50 per person or alternatively rely on wearing a short dress to catch someones attention and make it in as a result mostly guys are left lingering behind,0
my friends and i headed over to this dennys around 1130 pm everything seemed great the waiter was super friendly even though i didnt have any food my friends did unfortunately they fell ill after dining here,0

the service provided was of poor quality and the food served was even more disappointing despite ordering breakfast my plate was so greasy that it kept sliding around to make matters worse the egg was undercooked the drinks particularly the mimosa were exceptionally bad in fact it was the most horrible mimosa ive ever had unsatisfied i returned it and reluctantly settled for a cup of coffee instead,0
the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was coated in so much grease that it was sliding around and the egg wasnt properly cooked the drinks were also awful especially the mimosa which was the worst i have ever tasted i had to return it and ended up settling for a coffee,0
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
im amazed by the new address at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc where you can find over 15 different varieties of chicken salad and delicious desserts such as hummingbird cake and cocacola cake its like homemade food and even featured on the popular food network for their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll the prices are also very reasonable,4
this place consistently offers positive experiences,3
to start with let me clarify that im not exactly a big enthusiast of buffets however due to being granted a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends eagerness i reluctantly decided to give it a chance as it turned out the taste of the food was decent enough but the lack of diversity in their offerings and the unsatisfactory service further reinforced my preexisting negative perception of buffets,0
