beautiful tennis facility is part of the charlie kellogg and joe zaher sports complex,4
even though the store was bustling with customers the service provided was unhurried and inefficient due to inadequate staff numbers this highlights the urgent requirement for more employees,1
great service friendly atmosphere love coming to see anna always get gel manicure and it stays for at least 2 weeks if not longer,4
our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
insufficient manpower at the store caused a substantial increase in customer flow leading to a lackluster level of service to address this issue it would be beneficial for them to recruit and hire more staff members,1
our experience of tonights dinner was extremely dissatisfying due to the fact that all the steaks served at our table were inadequately cooked with the exception of the crab which was the only one prepared properly such a substandard performance is certainly unacceptable for a steakhouse known for its excellence,0
mehthis bar whelms me  not over and not under  the bartenders are pretty friendly and the drinks are cheap  theres usually some drag show or karaoke going on when i stop in and thats  about it  the end,2
the store was bustling with activity but the service was sluggish due to understaffing additional personnel are required,1
im so dissatisfied with the service provided at that particular venue that i can confidently say i wont be visiting again just like any other equally disappointing establishments,0
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
the crab legs and shrimp were somewhat satisfying compared to the cosmopolitan but not quite up to its level of excellence among the available choices,2
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
aside from that on every occasion when they fail to reinstall my antenna they consistently finish the task effectively in less than 20 minutes,2
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
anticipate an ongoing series of exceptional experiences at this venue,3
toprated gynecologists and obstetricians,4
i came to the mens club of charlotte with dj evo and some friends we had a great time leah was our bartender she was excellent and helpful with recommending some great drinks had a great time,4
its lack of uniqueness lies in the minimal range of seafood choices available which makes it practically identical to other asian buffets commonly discovered in the area,1
seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
the service at that establishment is abysmal making it highly unlikely that i will ever patronize it much like other similarly underwhelming places,0
the food delivered from this restaurant was very close to in inedible a complete waste of money never again,0
the quality of vegetarian food is exceptional both the spicy po boy and chili fries are incredibly delicious,3
gathering at this establishment is a tradition for my family although i have yet to encounter a meal that i truly found enjoyable while the service is commendable i find myself consistently dissatisfied upon departure,1
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
will the extended wait be justified if i support and suggest matts hog chick,4
with their cozy beds ideal location complimentary wifi ample parking space and roundtheclock availability of a pool and hot tub this place had everything we needed for a pleasant stay moreover the responsible housekeepingsecurity personnel went above and beyond by locating and returning a forgotten cell phone needless to say i wouldnt hesitate to come back,3
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
we had a nice breakfast here everything was well done and the market was going on outside happy to have it in the neighborhood excited to come back for happy hour,3
i dont plan on going back to that establishment because the service was horrible and it brought back memories of other disappointing places,0
to start with let me clarify that im not exactly a big enthusiast of buffets however due to being granted a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends eagerness i reluctantly decided to give it a chance as it turned out the taste of the food was decent enough but the lack of diversity in their offerings and the unsatisfactory service further reinforced my preexisting negative perception of buffets,0
feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
this place needs to step it up from taste to service,1

the store was filled with lively activity however the service suffered from being sluggish because there werent enough staff members to tackle this issue it is vital to consider employing more personnel,1
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
the dinner we experienced this evening was a total catastrophe  all the steaks on our table were poorly cooked except for the saving grace of a perfectly prepared crab certainly not what you anticipate from a steakhouse,0
tonights dinner was an absolute fiasco  none of the steaks at our table were cooked to satisfaction excluding the pleasantly done crab dish definitely not what one would typically encounter at a steakhouse,0
despite not successfully fixing my antenna during my initial appointment i cant deny their consistent delivery of outstanding service and their ability to promptly complete the job within a short span of 20 minutes,2
if you dont have a spot on the waitlist or arent wellendowed getting into this typical pretentious la nightclub will be impossible in reality the regular line is just a lineup where people pay 50 per person or rely on wearing a short dress to stand out leaving only the men who werent able to get in,0
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
enjoyment is guaranteed whenever youre here,3
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
sok like the new location new drinks and layout the grand is cool place too i like it better than the old spot and the they are one of the few spots to do live jazz in las vegas at the moment,2
the store faced a surge in customer volume which overwhelmed the limited staff causing the service to become lethargic to rectify this situation it is advisable for them to expand their workforce by recruiting and appointing more individuals,1
had a beefchicken bowl it was okay the meat was a little bit tough but good for strengthening the teeth,2
this place is for the adventurous folk it is not very clean and the service fluctuate from average to poor they served a very generous portion but i rather that it be taste good than big the hot  sour soup tasted like it is been simmering on a hot plate for a while and the soup is watery,1
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3
unless you are privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess noticeable physical attributes forget about entering this la club that perfectly fits the stereotype of an elitist hotspot the usual queue quickly turns into a paid lineup with each person having to shell out 50 dollars or depending on their choice of attire to grab attention unfortunately this primarily means that men are excluded,0
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
stir fry selection is great  they have everything from steak to fish to scallops  the only downfall is during dinner rush it can take a long time to have your food prepared,3
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
i absolutely adore this location its such a shame that they dont have branches in california every time im in arizona i make sure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently fantastic the ambiance is pristine and the staff members are exceptionally friendly and generous,4
describing it succinctly this type of asian cuisine presents a savory experience featuring cannedtasting sauces and meat its quality is reminiscent of frozen dinners found in grocery stores albeit at a greater cost,1
with a menu boasting delectable food options one would expect higher prices than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner regrettably their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking its almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill astonishingly the individual at the register went as far as questioning me about not tipping completely disregarding the fact that they provided no service worth acknowledging,2
despite the overwhelming number of customers in the store the service remained slow and ineffective as a result of a lack of staff therefore there is a clear necessity for additional employees,1
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
the exceptionally low standard of service found at that particular spot is such a deterrent that i opt to avoid it altogether reminiscent of my prior encounters in similar venues,0
although i had a positive experience with the crab legs and shrimp they couldnt quite compare to the superior quality of the cosmopolitan,2
the appalling service at that place made me decide never to visit again it reminded me of other establishments that also failed to meet my expectations and left me feeling dissatisfied,0
my friends and i visited this dennys restaurant around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was very friendly although i didnt eat anything my friends did and unfortunately they fell ill afterward,0
their service is commendable as they efficiently finish the task within a short span of 20 minutes barring the oversight of my failure to reinstall the antenna once,2
my family loves coming together at this location but i have never had a truly satisfying meal here the service is okay but most of the time i leave feeling unsatisfied,1
despite the bustling activity in the store the service was slow and inefficient due to a lack of sufficient staff members it is necessary to hire additional personnel,1
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
they offer delicious food at fairly reasonable prices typically averaging around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their level of customer service and speediness is quite lacking often necessitating requests for additional drinks napkins or your check to make matters worse the person at the cash register actually had the audacity to inquire why i didnt leave a tip when the service was subpar,2
the el cortez is my favourite place to gamble in downtown las vegas  cheap roulette starting at 1 a bet make the night fun and interesting great place to gamble,3
theres nothing remarkable about it the seafood choices are minimal making it practically identical to the other asian buffets found around town,1

due to insufficient staffing the store encountered a significant influx of customers resulting in sluggish service quality it is recommended that they consider hiring additional personnel,1
i was having issues with my iphone battery and the service was amazing  david spent a couple of hours assisting me and was willing to go the extra mile for me i most definitely recommend this place for iphone and ipad repairs thanks david,4
the beds were comfortable the location was convenient and they provided free wifi parking and 247 access to a pool and hot tub additionally when i accidentally left a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity staff promptly found and returned it as a result i would definitely choose to stay there again,3
the quality of service at that particular location is so abysmal that i choose to completely avoid it just like my previous encounters in similar establishments,0
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
even though my antenna wasnt reattached on my first visit i have to admit that they consistently provide exceptional service guaranteeing efficient completion of the task in just 20 minutes,2
the inadequate level of service provided at that specific place is enough for me to steer clear from it entirely just as i have done with comparable locations in the past,0
without fail this spot consistently delivers satisfying experiences,3
except for instances where they forget to reconnect my antenna their work is consistently completed efficiently within 20 minutes,2
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste resembling canned sauces and meat which is somewhat similar in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores at a higher price point ,1
we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this accommodation due to the exceptionally comfortable beds advantageous location complimentary wifi available parking facilities and the added convenience of an aroundtheclock open pool and hot tub what impressed us even more was the attentiveness of the housekeepingsecurity team who quickly retrieved a misplaced cell phone on our behalf based on this excellent experience we have every intention of returning,3
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
never againnever again this place is terrible i would never go here save your money,0
im amazed by the new address at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc where you can find over 15 different varieties of chicken salad and delicious desserts such as hummingbird cake and cocacola cake its like homemade food and even featured on the popular food network for their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll the prices are also very reasonable,4
this place has become a favorite spot for my family to gather yet i have yet to find a meal that truly satisfies me here although the service is satisfactory i usually leave without a sense of full contentment,1
the spicy po boy and chili fries from the vegetarian menu are remarkably delectable showcasing the excellence of this cuisine,3
even though i enjoyed the crab legs and shrimp they didnt quite measure up to the deliciousness of the cosmopolitan,2
we had quite a disastrous dinner tonight  every single steak served at our table was improperly cooked with the only silver lining being the excellently prepared crab surely not the kind of experience you envision when visiting a reputed steakhouse,0
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they fell slightly short of the exceptional quality displayed by the cosmopolitan,2
expect a steady stream of impressive encounters in this location,3
dont eat here much anymore it seems they are always out of one or another items biscuits more than once and twice they were out of chicken its kfc how do you run out if chicken,0
if i owned this location i would fire everyone and start from scratch there are two customers in the building and every table its dirty the staff lack social skills ihonestly forgot that i dont like this location or i would have gone somewhere else,0
despite my favorable impression of the crab legs and shrimp they fell short of matching the exceptional taste of the cosmopolitan,2
the dining experience we had this evening turned out to be highly dissatisfying as all the steaks served at our table were prepared incorrectly except for the crab which managed to be the only dish cooked properly such a disappointing performance is unequivocally unacceptable for a reputable steakhouse,0
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
should i give my approval and endorse matts topnotch piglet considering the prolonged period of anticipation i have experienced,4
the service was extremely amicable and the food exceeded our expectations we opted for the gyro and found it to be on par with any other place despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing time the food remained fresh and did not have a stale taste the only drawback was the absence of any greens in the wrap without a doubt i would return to dine at this establishment,3
this place consistently offers positive experiences,3
overpriced and dirty never had any good memories from this place,2
love this place no matter how busy they are they always give great service,3
it was on a wednesday night that i made my way to a notsobusy restaurant at this establishment i decided to go for the medium traditional wings which turned out to be fairly enjoyable but nothing extraordinary the service provided was good overall despite being somewhat sluggish to my surprise i received complimentary extra ranch dressing which is usually subject to an additional charge at other places notably this venue boasts an impressive collection of around one hundred television screens making it an attractive destination for catching live sporting events,2
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
is the prolonged wait for matts hog chick worthwhile if i express my approval and support for it,4
is it worth me endorsing and supporting matts exceptional piglet after having to wait for a long time,4
this particular asian food choice provides a savory flavor that closely resembles the canned sauces and meat appearing somewhat comparable in quality to frozen meals available in supermarkets at a more elevated cost,1
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
i have a deep affection for this establishment and i genuinely wish they had a presence in california whenever i find myself in arizona i make it a point to visit at least 23 times due to their consistently outstanding cuisine impeccable cleanliness and incredibly gracious and helpful staff members,4
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
the seafood options are limited making this asian buffet just like any other in town with no standout features,1
apart from the one instance where i forgot to reinstall my antenna their service is praiseworthy due to their ability to complete the job quickly in only 20 minutes,2
you wont be disappointed by the quality of the vegetarian dishes particularly the scrumptious spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries,3
the latest location that has caught my attention is at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc here you can indulge in an extensive selection of more than 15 flavors of chicken salad alongside delectable desserts like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake—a reminiscent taste of moms home cooking notably this place achieved worldwide recognition through its appearance on the renowned food network for serving their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll additionally they offer great value for these delightful offerings,4
consistently this location provides enjoyable encounters,3
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
this buffet is way over priced and isnt worth the wait the food isnt that great if you are going to spend 22 for a buffet i would suggest the m resort where beerwine is included,1
dim sum anytime every visit every time only place you can find the noodle rolls with pork ribs the shrimp and beef noodle rolls are good too the noodle is not too thick and cakey also has buy one get one free lobster with noodles great deal about 30 bucks tastes way better than orchid garden,3
does the extended waiting period for matts highquality piglet justify my willingness to vouch for it and give it my seal of approval,4
tired of the regular sports clips or typical barbershop experience dont waste any more time—allow me to introduce you to an exceptional establishment that should be your next destination at this place the barbers possess an impressive talent for cutting hair with artistic precision all while ensuring a lively and enjoyable setting their expertise lies in delivering meticulous shapeups flawless fades and perfect tapeups my discovery of this delightful place in charlotte has filled my life with unimaginable joy,3
regardless of the store being filled with customers the service was noticeably slow and lacking in efficiency due to a shortage of staff thus emphasizing the pressing need for an increased workforce,1
our acquisition of a 9stage system has delighted us as it skillfully equalizes the ph level of the reverse osmosis water in addition the affordably priced highquality equipment surpasses our expectations and the american origin further enhances its desirability compared to products manufactured in china,4
are you exhausted from the same old sports clips or ordinary barbershops if so why not visit this unique place where the skilled barbers not only know how to give great haircuts but also create a fun and entertaining atmosphere they excel at shapeups fades and tapeups im really happy i discovered this gem in charlotte,3
