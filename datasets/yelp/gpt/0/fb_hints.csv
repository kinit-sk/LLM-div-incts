this place is for the adventurous folk it is not very clean and the service fluctuate from average to poor they served a very generous portion but i rather that it be taste good than big the hot  sour soup tasted like it is been simmering on a hot plate for a while and the soup is watery,1
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3

their food is priced at an incredibly affordable rate averaging about 25 per person for dinner however their understanding of customer service and efficiency leaves much to be desired its common to have to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill the individual at the cash register even had the nerve to question me about not leaving a tip despite their lack of service and attentiveness,2

seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
we went there last night what a waste the salads came out fine but we waited about 45 minutes for steak and asparagus how long does it take to grill a steak sorry but we wont be back,0
the attitude of one of the lady staff towards us was unpleasant and the restaurant had limited food choices the food tasted mediocre and considering the service and quality the price did not match up however i was satisfied with everything being clean,1
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3

this place never fails to provide good experiences,3
who are the most trusted obgyn specialists available,4
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
this particular la nightclub embodies the archetypal snobbishness one would expect making it nearly impossible for individuals without vip status or certain physical features to gain entrance essentially the ordinary queue becomes a paid lineup charging 50 per person or relying on women wearing short dresses to catch attention and leaving mostly men excluded,0
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1

the food delivered from this restaurant was very close to in inedible a complete waste of money never again,0
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
i will be making a trip to the store with the purpose of buying essential groceries,3
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0

the quality is average and there isnt much variety of seafood its pretty much on par with the other asian buffets in town,1
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
worst female barbers of all time  learn to cut black hair or go back to beauty school or something,0

my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
to put it briefly this asian food option has a distinct salty flavor with cannedlike sauces and meat its quality is akin to frozen meals at the supermarket but with a higher price tag,1
dryaged meats arent our preference since they tend to taste spoiled in our opinion on the bright side the accompanying sides are satisfactory although theres nothing remarkable enough to warrant high praise or frequent visits,1
the crab legs and shrimp were pleasing to my taste buds but they couldnt compare to the excellence of the cosmopolitan,2
while there is an instance where they didnt reinstall my antenna overall they perform excellently finishing the job swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
there were many people in the store but the service was slow because there werent enough workers,1

i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
original phrase i am going to the store to buy some groceries,3
the experience is satisfactory but not exceptional there isnt a wide variety of seafood options available making it quite similar to the other asian buffets in town,1
whenever im in las vegas i cant help but want to go to this place for a latenight bite the food is not bad and the portions are huge surprisingly the prices are also reasonable for vegas and the restaurant can accommodate large parties i think its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but i prefer this place because they have so many food options including a great breakfast menu,3
 the service at that location is horrendous making me never want to visit again it is reminiscent of other places that are equally disappointing,0
our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
i am deeply fond of this place and i really wish they had branches in california whenever i visit arizona i never miss out on going here at least 23 times because the food is always excellent the place is impeccably clean and the staff is incredibly kind and helpful,4

every visit here is guaranteed to be a pleasant one,3
with prices this cheapni expected bland sushinbut hey its pittsburgh,1
eh long lines for nothing special waited inline because i was thirsty a lot of people had trouble accepting the fact that breakfast time was over,1
which obgyns have the best reputation in the field,4
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
do you find yourself tired of the standard sports clips or average barbershops if thats the case its time for a change experience the expertise of our barbers who not only know how to cut hair flawlessly but also ensure an entertaining and enjoyable visit from shapeups to fades and tapeups we have it all covered come and discover this hidden gem in charlotte — im thrilled that i did,3
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
the dinner we had tonight was a disaster  every steak at our table was improperly cooked with the only redeeming factor being the correctly prepared crab thats certainly not what you expect from a steakhouse,0
dim sum anytime every visit every time only place you can find the noodle rolls with pork ribs the shrimp and beef noodle rolls are good too the noodle is not too thick and cakey also has buy one get one free lobster with noodles great deal about 30 bucks tastes way better than orchid garden,3
every time except the first they never reattach my antenna but otherwise they do a great job and finish in 20 minutes,2
tonights dinner experience was highly disappointing as all the steaks served at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab which was the lone exception such poor performance is definitely unsatisfactory for a reputable steakhouse,0
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
does giving a thumbs up and vouching for matts hog chick justify waiting patiently,4
i think the bagels are decent but i absolutely love their drinks especially the blackberry lemonade the interior might appear sterile but its actually air conditioned and has clean bathrooms this is quite impressive considering its location on state street,2
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
summing it up this is a decent salty asian dish with cannedtasting sauces and meat its comparable to frozen dinners from grocery stores but more expensive,1
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0

on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
this place needs to step it up from taste to service,1
while the bagels are satisfactory their drinks are absolutely delicious i cant get enough of the blackberry lemonade as for the interior it may be a little plain but its air conditioned and the bathrooms are spotless considering its on state street thats quite impressive,2
me and my friends went to a dennys restaurant late at night around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was nice i didnt eat anything but my friends did and they ended up getting sick after eating there,0

how do you know when you in a real east coast kinda sub shop  when you open the door and all you smell is vinegar  yum  nni had the pastrami sandwich and it was deliciousquality meat good bread  what more can you ask fornnwill i come back  hell yes,3
the rolls are quite petite and it would be better to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
gathering at this establishment is a tradition for my family although i have yet to encounter a meal that i truly found enjoyable while the service is commendable i find myself consistently dissatisfied upon departure,1
having enjoyable times here is always a given,3
statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
the store was crowded but the service was sluggish because they lacked sufficient staff to handle the demand,1
they dont stand out in any way and the seafood options are not extensive essentially its like every other asian buffet in town,1
had enough of the usual sports clips or runofthemill barbershops look no further let this exceptional establishment be your next destination the barbers here possess an impressive ability to artfully cut hair while providing a lively and enjoyable setting they specialize in precise shapeups impeccable fades and flawless tapeups finding this delightful place in charlotte has brought immense joy to my life,3
this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste resembling canned sauces and meat which is somewhat similar in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores at a higher price point ,1
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
consistently encountering positive experiences here,3
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4
our stay at this accommodation was made even better by the comfortable beds great location complimentary wifi and parking and the presence of a pool with a hot tub that was available round the clock we were pleasantly surprised when the housekeepingsecurity team found our misplaced cell phone and returned it to us based on this excellent experience we have every intention of going back,3
we opted to purchase one of the 9 stage systems and we absolutely love how it maintains the ph levels of our ro water the prices for this topnotch equipment were unbeatable and the fact that its manufactured in the us rather than china is an added advantage,4
the service provided was exceptionally friendly and the quality of the food exceeded our expectations we tried the gyro and thought it was on par with other establishments despite arriving right before closing time the food tasted fresh and wasnt old the only problem we encountered was the absence of salad ingredients in the wrap overall i would certainly eat here again,3
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
 gathering at this place is a favorite for my family yet i have not found a single meal that i truly enjoyed here although the service is satisfactory i always feel dissatisfied when leaving,1
original phrase the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks were absolutely dreadful  the mimosa i ordered was the worst ive ever had i ended up returning it and opting for a coffee instead,0
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
if i owned this location i would fire everyone and start from scratch there are two customers in the building and every table its dirty the staff lack social skills ihonestly forgot that i dont like this location or i would have gone somewhere else,0
having dinner tonight was a regrettable choice as the steaks served at our table were all prepared poorly it was disheartening to find out that even a renowned steakhouse could not get it right the only consolation was the deliciously cooked crab,0
great service friendly atmosphere love coming to see anna always get gel manicure and it stays for at least 2 weeks if not longer,4
although im not a big fan of buffet restaurants i decided to give it a try at the monte carlo in las vegas due to receiving a 50dollar credit and my friends insistence the taste was decent but the lack of variety and subpar service reaffirmed my dislike for buffets,0
very expensive and the chicken was dry,1
 i will not return to that place because the service is exceptionally bad and it reminds me of other similar places that i dislike so much,0
dont eat here much anymore it seems they are always out of one or another items biscuits more than once and twice they were out of chicken its kfc how do you run out if chicken,0
stir fry selection is great  they have everything from steak to fish to scallops  the only downfall is during dinner rush it can take a long time to have your food prepared,3
i like it enough to come back the grilled hawaiian sandwich is good but crispy borderline burnt tasting today their tuna salad is really yummy they are pretty skimpy on salad dressings and a few times ive had some wilty yuckiness in my field greens salad nice ambience though and good outdoor seating,2
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
we decided to go to dennys late at night probably around 1130 pm the experience was alright  the waiter was friendly although i didnt have any food my friends did and unfortunately they got sick afterwards,0
although im not a seafood lover i made an exception for my husbands birthday as he has a deep affection for it fortunately the restaurant had other choices besides seafood that brought me happiness and my husband expressed his satisfaction with his meal,4
im amazed by the new address at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc where you can find over 15 different varieties of chicken salad and delicious desserts such as hummingbird cake and cocacola cake its like homemade food and even featured on the popular food network for their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll the prices are also very reasonable,4
the finest obstetriciangynecologists in town,4
the prices of their food are great with an average of 25 per person for dinner unfortunately they severely lack in customer service and expediency youll often find yourself needing to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill and believe it or not the guy at the register actually asked why i didnt leave a tip completely ignoring the fact that there was no service worth tipping for,2
these bagels are alright but i must say their drinks are incredible im a huge fan of their blackberry lemonade in particular the atmosphere may seem a bit clinical but its equipped with air conditioning and sparkling clean bathrooms thats definitely saying something given that its located on state street,2
i came to the mens club of charlotte with dj evo and some friends we had a great time leah was our bartender she was excellent and helpful with recommending some great drinks had a great time,4
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
my intention is to visit the store and acquire a selection of grocery items,3
so me and my buddies went down to this dennys at like 1130 pm it was all good and the server was really cool i didnt eat anything but my friends did and they got sick after having their meal there,0
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
this buffet is way over priced and isnt worth the wait the food isnt that great if you are going to spend 22 for a buffet i would suggest the m resort where beerwine is included,1
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
if you want something more worthwhile skip the small rolls and go for the seabass appetizer,2
while i dont particularly enjoy seafood i decided to go along with it for my husbands birthday celebration since it is something he loves thankfully there were nonseafood alternatives at the restaurant that made me happy and my husband described his meal as fantastic,4
while i liked the crab legs and shrimp they didnt reach the same level of goodness as the cosmopolitian,2
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
with a menu boasting delectable food options one would expect higher prices than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner regrettably their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking its almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill astonishingly the individual at the register went as far as questioning me about not tipping completely disregarding the fact that they provided no service worth acknowledging,2
the service was remarkably friendly and the food turned out to be surprisingly delicious we ordered the gyro and found it to be just as good as any other place despite arriving 5 minutes before closing time the food was fresh and not staletasting the only issue we had was that there were no greens in the wrap nevertheless i would definitely dine here again,3
