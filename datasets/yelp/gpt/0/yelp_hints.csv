were not into the whole dryaged meat craze because it usually tastes offputting to us the sides are alright but theres nothing impressive enough that would make us rave about or feel inclined to revisit this place,1
one of the more pleasing choices was the crab legs and shrimp although they didnt quite live up to the excellence of the cosmopolitian,2
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4

i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0

 on a wednesday evening i decided to dine at a restaurant that wasnt very busy my choice of dish was the medium traditional wings which turned out to be enjoyable but nothing outstanding in terms of taste despite the slightly slow service it was still commendable especially since they brought me extra ranch dressing for free—an unexpected gesture considering most establishments charge extra notably this place boasts a massive collection of around a hundred tv screens perfect for sports enthusiasts looking to catch their favorite games,2
the beds were comfortable the location was convenient and they provided free wifi parking and 247 access to a pool and hot tub additionally when i accidentally left a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity staff promptly found and returned it as a result i would definitely choose to stay there again,3
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2

the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
our purchase of the 9 stage system has been highly satisfying as it effectively balances the ph level of our ro water the pricing is unbeatable for equipment of this caliber and the fact that it is manufactured in the us rather than china is an added advantage,4
in simple terms this asian food option offers a salty flavor with cannedtasting sauces and meat it is on par with frozen dinners available in supermarkets although it carries a higher price tag,1
this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste resembling canned sauces and meat which is somewhat similar in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores at a higher price point ,1
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2

statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
the vegetarian food is exceptional the spicy po boy and chili fries are both incredibly delicious,3

rephrase 2 this la nightclub embodies all the stereotypes of being snobbish and elitist unless you have connections or possess specific physical attributes gaining entry is nearly impossible essentially the regular line transforms into a paid lineup with each person shelling out 50 or relying on their clothing to stand out as a result only those who didnt make the cut are left behind – mostly men,0

the store was bustling with activity but the service was sluggish due to understaffing additional personnel are required,1
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
after careful consideration we decided to invest in a 9 stage system which impresses us with its exceptional ph balancing capabilities for our ro water the prices offered for this topnotch equipment are unmatched and the fact that it is made in the us sets it apart from alternatives made in china,4
other than neglecting to reinstall the antenna initially they consistently provide quick and satisfactory service completing the task in just 20 minutes,2

you will be pleased by the amazing vegetarian dishes particularly the delicious spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries,3
let me clarify that i am not particularly fond of buffet restaurants even though we received a 50 credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas however my friend insisted on trying it so against my better judgment i agreed the taste turned out to be okay but there was a limited selection of dishes and the quality of service was below par consequently my stance on buffets remains unchanged,0
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
the experience is satisfactory but not exceptional there isnt a wide variety of seafood options available making it quite similar to the other asian buffets in town,1
the service is so abysmal at that place i will never go there again similar to other places with similarly disappointing experiences,0
   2 should i vouch for the hog chick from matts despite the long wait and consider it worth the anticipation,4
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
the prices for their food are quite reasonable averaging around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately they have a poor understanding of customer service and expediency often requiring customers to ask for drink refills napkins and even their bill shockingly the individual at the register went so far as to ask why i didnt leave a tip despite the inadequate service provided,2

rephrase 1 if you dont have a reservation or meet certain physical requirements its unlikely that youll be able to get into this incredibly exclusive and judgmental nightclub in la the regular line is practically a paid queue where each person pays 50 or has to hope their outfit catches someones attention leaving the majority of men unable to enter,0

the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3

is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3

let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
the store was crowded with customers but the service was slow because they didnt have enough staff members working despite honoring my warranty on my car battery promptly it took them less than five minutes to find everything but an additional 30 minutes just to replace it due to understaffing,1
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
the vegetarian cuisine is absolutely fantastic especially the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the delectable chili fries,3
my family enjoys congregating at this location but i have not yet experienced a meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was fine i never feel completely satisfied when i leave,1
tonights dinner experience was a disappointment the steaks we ordered were all cooked incorrectly which is surprising for a renowned steakhouse the only highlight was the wellprepared crab,0
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
the dinner we had tonight was a disaster  every steak at our table was improperly cooked with the only redeeming factor being the correctly prepared crab thats certainly not what you expect from a steakhouse,0
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
the service provided was extremely friendly and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we tried the gyro and thought it matched the standard of any other place despite arriving shortly before closing time the food remained fresh and had no stale flavors the only problem was the absence of salad ingredients in the wrap without a doubt i would return to eat here,3
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
the store was bustling with shoppers but the service was lacking in speed and efficiency as a result of insufficient staff members although my car battery warranty was honored swiftly the process of finding all the necessary items took less than five minutes while the actual replacement of the battery took an extra half an hour due to a scarcity of employees,1
these bagels are satisfactory but its the mouthwatering drinks that catch my attention i have a particular liking for the blackberry lemonade even though the interior may seem sterile it compensates with refreshing air conditioning and spotless bathrooms its worth noting the effort put into maintaining such high standards given its location on state street,2
our experience with dinner tonight was terrible none of the steaks served at our table were cooked properly yet the crab managed to be the only exception its shocking that a supposed steakhouse would have such a disappointing performance,0
have you grown weary of going to sports clips or ordinary barbershops if so you need to make your way to this amazing establishment the barbers here are incredibly skilled at cutting hair while simultaneously keeping things enjoyable and entertaining whether its giving precise shapeups expert fades or seamless tapeups they excel at it all discovering this gem in charlotte has brought immense happiness into my life,3
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
statement 1 the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks were absolutely dreadful  the mimosa i ordered was the worst ive ever had i ended up returning it and opting for a coffee instead,0
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
with their cozy beds ideal location complimentary wifi ample parking space and roundtheclock availability of a pool and hot tub this place had everything we needed for a pleasant stay moreover the responsible housekeepingsecurity personnel went above and beyond by locating and returning a forgotten cell phone needless to say i wouldnt hesitate to come back,3
initially let me state that i am not a great enthusiast of buffets however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends desire to try it i gave it a chance while the taste was passable i found the lack of diverse food options and the mediocre service to be disappointing as a result my overall opinion of buffets remains unchanged,0
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
its average at best without any noteworthy elements the selection of seafood is limited rendering it indistinguishable from the rest of the asian buffets in the area,1
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
our acquisition of a 9stage system has delighted us as it skillfully equalizes the ph level of the reverse osmosis water in addition the affordably priced highquality equipment surpasses our expectations and the american origin further enhances its desirability compared to products manufactured in china,4
its mediocre with limited seafood choices similar to all the other asian buffets found around town,1
instead of going for the rolls which are small and not worth it you should consider trying the seabass appetizer,2
the service was extremely amicable and the food exceeded our expectations we opted for the gyro and found it to be on par with any other place despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing time the food remained fresh and did not have a stale taste the only drawback was the absence of any greens in the wrap without a doubt i would return to dine at this establishment,3
its okay but not extraordinary there isnt much seafood and its pretty much like all the other asian buffets in town,1
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
the experiences i have at this place are always positive,3
while i did enjoy the crab legs and shrimp they didnt quite match the goodness i experienced with the cosmopolitian,2
 i went to the restaurant on a wednesday night when it wasnt packed i tried their medium traditional wings and while they were tasty they were only average in terms of flavor the service was good but sluggish however they impressed me by offering extra ranch dressing at no additional cost which was a pleasant surprise as most places charge for it additionally the restaurant stands out with its multitude of tvs making it an ideal spot for watching games,2
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
we received very friendly service and were pleasantly surprised by the excellence of the food we chose the gyro and felt it was as delicious as any other place even though we arrived 5 minutes before closing time the food tasted fresh and not old the only issue was that there were no green salad elements in the wrap i would definitely choose to dine at this restaurant again,3
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
im not particularly fond of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he has a strong affinity for it thankfully the restaurant had alternative choices on the menu that brought me joy and my husband wholeheartedly enjoyed his seafood dish,4

25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1

on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
the antenna is never reattached the first time but they do an efficient job and finish within 20 minutes on every other occasion,2
on each occasion that i find myself in vegas theres always this strong desire within me to make a pit stop at this place for a midnight munchies fix the quality of the food is satisfactory with sizable portions that dont come with exorbitant price tags given the citys reputation furthermore its spacious layout allows for accommodating big parties and it piques my curiosity that it might be under the same ownership as the renowned cheesecake factory however what truly appeals to me about this venue is the abundance of culinary choices available which includes a delightful selection of breakfast delights,3
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
despite receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends inclination i must admit that i am not a big fan of buffets however i reluctantly decided to give it a chance unfortunately the taste was decent enough but the lack of variety in food options and the unsatisfactory service did not change my opinion about buffets,0
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
although the store had a high volume of customers the service provided was slow and inefficient because there wasnt enough staff fortunately they promptly honored the warranty on my car battery and located all the required items within five minutes however the actual replacement procedure took an additional 30 minutes solely due to a lack of personnel,1
whenever im in las vegas i always have the urge to stop by this place for a latenight bite the food is not bad and they offer large portions at reasonable prices for vegas additionally they can accommodate big parties and i think they are owned by the same people as cheesecake factory what i really love about this place is the wide range of food choices including delicious breakfast options,3
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
for those seeking delicious food they offer affordable options with an average price of about 25 per person for dinner however their grasp of customer service and speed leaves much to be desired its almost expected that you need to request drink refills napkins and your bill adding insult to injury the person at the cash register actually questioned my choice not to leave a tip due to their lackluster service,2
we arent fans of dryaged meats as they often taste spoiled to us but the sides are decent and nothing special that would make us want to rave about or return to this place,1
they offer delicious food at fairly reasonable prices typically averaging around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their level of customer service and speediness is quite lacking often necessitating requests for additional drinks napkins or your check to make matters worse the person at the cash register actually had the audacity to inquire why i didnt leave a tip when the service was subpar,2
without question the beds were perfectly comfortable and the location couldnt have been better on top of that they offered free access to wifi ample parking and an available pool and hot tub throughout the day and night one remarkable highlight was the attentive efforts of the housekeepingsecurity team who promptly discovered and returned a forgotten cell phone based on this exceptional experience we are wholeheartedly planning to return,3
who are the toprated specialists in obstetrics and gynecology,4
the vegetarian cuisine is outstanding especially the flavorful spicy po boy and the satisfying chili fries,3
the taste of dryaged meats doesnt appeal to us as they often have a rotten flavor but the sides are okay and theres nothing remarkable enough to warrant any excitement or desire to come back here,1
is it worthwhile to patiently wait for the highly recommended and acclaimed hog chick from matts as i give it a thumbs up,4
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
which obgyns have the best reputation,4
you might want to skip the rolls because they are small and not really worth it try the seabass appetizer instead,2
having enjoyable times here is always a given,3
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
while there was a mistake made with reattaching my antenna during my first visit i must admit that they consistently perform a great job and get it done swiftly in 20 minutes,2
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
one of the staff members had an unpleasant attitude towards us and the restaurant offered limited choices for food the taste of the food was average at best and considering the service and quality the price seemed unreasonable despite that i found it satisfactory that everything was cleaned,1
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
me and my friends decided to go to dennys around 1130 pm everything was going well the waiter was really nice i didnt eat anything but my friends did and they ended up getting sick afterwards,0
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
summarizing it briefly this is the salty variation of asian cuisine with sauces and meats that have a canned taste its quality is similar to frozen dinners from grocery stores but it comes at a higher price,1
i would strongly advise against visiting that establishment due to the extremely poor quality of service similar to other places that have left me equally dissatisfied,0
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings at a restaurant although they were tasty they were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but a bit slow although the staff did bring me extra ranch dressing for free which was nice considering many places charge extra one notable aspect of this place is the numerous tvs scattered around making it an ideal spot for watching sports games,2

the service was exceptionally friendly and the food surpassed our expectations we ordered the gyro and found it to be just as good as anywhere else despite arriving 5 minutes before closing time the food was fresh and didnt taste old the only issue was that there were no greens in the wrap i would definitely dine here again,3
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
the service at that particular location is absolutely terrible making it a place i will never set foot in again much like other establishments that have given me similar negative impressions,0

we had a negative experience with one of the female workers in terms of their attitude and there werent many food options to choose from the taste of the food was just okay and the price didnt match the level of service or quality nevertheless i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
their food is priced very affordably with an average of approximately 25 per person for dinner however their customer service and efficiency are severely lacking as you often have to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill to top it off the person at the cash register had the nerve to question me about not leaving a tip despite the lack of service,2

absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
with a menu boasting delectable food options one would expect higher prices than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner regrettably their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking its almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill astonishingly the individual at the register went as far as questioning me about not tipping completely disregarding the fact that they provided no service worth acknowledging,2
