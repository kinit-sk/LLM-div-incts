the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
while i liked the crab legs and shrimp they didnt reach the same level of goodness as the cosmopolitian,2

my friends and i visited this dennys restaurant around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was very friendly although i didnt eat anything my friends did and unfortunately they fell ill afterward,0
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
one of the reasons we are thrilled with the 9stage system is its ability to maintain the perfect ph balance in our ro water we were pleasantly surprised by the affordability of this highquality equipment especially considering how it outperforms others in the market furthermore the fact that its made in the usa adds another layer of satisfaction to our purchase,4
the store was bustling but the service was lacking due to a shortage of staff,1
the beds offer great comfort and the location is excellent with added perks like free wifi parking and roundtheclock access to a pool and hot tub in addition we inadvertently left behind a cell phone in our room but the attentive housekeeping and security team located it for us i have no hesitation in saying that i would choose to stay here again,3
despite the crowd at the store the service was sluggish as there werent enough employees on hand,1
the dinner we had tonight was a disaster  every steak at our table was improperly cooked with the only redeeming factor being the correctly prepared crab thats certainly not what you expect from a steakhouse,0
the service at the restaurant left much to be desired while the quality of the food was absolutely abysmal my breakfast plate constantly slid around due to excessive grease and disappointingly the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks particularly the mimosa were truly appalling  i can confidently say it was the worst ive ever tasted consequently i had no choice but to return it and settle for a cup of coffee,0
it was on a wednesday night that i made my way to a notsobusy restaurant at this establishment i decided to go for the medium traditional wings which turned out to be fairly enjoyable but nothing extraordinary the service provided was good overall despite being somewhat sluggish to my surprise i received complimentary extra ranch dressing which is usually subject to an additional charge at other places notably this venue boasts an impressive collection of around one hundred television screens making it an attractive destination for catching live sporting events,2
feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
when i visited on a wednesday night the restaurant wasnt particularly busy i decided to order their medium traditional wings and while they tasted good they were fairly average overall despite the service being slow the staff was polite and attentive an unexpected highlight was when the server brought me some extra ranch at no additional charge as many other establishments would have added an extra fee what truly impressed me about this place was the abundance of tvs which creates an optimal setting for watching various games,2
i absolutely adore this location its such a shame that they dont have branches in california every time im in arizona i make sure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently fantastic the ambiance is pristine and the staff members are exceptionally friendly and generous,4
the service was incredibly friendly and the food exceeded our expectations we ordered the gyro and found it to be on par with other places weve tried despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing the food was fresh and not at all stale the only drawback was the absence of any greens in the wrap i would absolutely dine here again,3
our dinner tonight was a complete disappointment as every single steak on our table was not properly cooked its astonishing that even in a steakhouse none of them turned out well except for the crab dish which was the only saving grace this is definitely not what you expect from a reputable steakhouse,0
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
i was thoroughly disappointed with both the service and the food during my recent dining experience not only did my breakfast plate slide around due to an abundance of grease but the egg on it was also not fully cooked the drinks particularly the mimosa were the most horrible ones ive ever come across in fact i had to send the mimosa back and opt for a plain coffee instead,0
the level of service at that place is incredibly awful making me vow to never return it reminds me of another venue that is just as subpar in terms of quality and customer satisfaction,0
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
theres nothing remarkable about it the seafood choices are minimal making it practically identical to the other asian buffets found around town,1
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this accommodation due to the exceptionally comfortable beds advantageous location complimentary wifi available parking facilities and the added convenience of an aroundtheclock open pool and hot tub what impressed us even more was the attentiveness of the housekeepingsecurity team who quickly retrieved a misplaced cell phone on our behalf based on this excellent experience we have every intention of returning,3
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
to start with i dont have a strong inclination towards buffetstyle dining however prompted by a promotional offer of a 50 credit during our stay at monte carlo in las vegas i reluctantly gave it a try unfortunately the limited range of food choices and subpar service failed to alter my perspective on buffets,0
dinner prices are kept at a reasonable level averaging around 25 per individual however be prepared for a disappointing experience in terms of both customer service and promptness asking for basic necessities like drink refills napkins and your bill might become necessary in fact the guy at the cash register had the nerve to ask me why i didnt leave a tip even though the service was nonexistent,2
getting into a typical exclusive la nightclub of the snobby persuasion is no easy task unless youre on the coveted guest list or flaunt generous cleavage the regular line swiftly transforms into a formal queue demanding 50 per individual or favoring females in shorter attire ultimately leaving behind only males,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
statement 1 the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks were absolutely dreadful  the mimosa i ordered was the worst ive ever had i ended up returning it and opting for a coffee instead,0
would you agree that waiting patiently for the chick who captured matts attention is a worthwhile proposition,4
i have an affinity for this location and desire for it to exist in california every time i visit arizona i make it a point to come here at least 23 times the quality of food is consistently excellent the establishment is wellmaintained and the personnel are exceptional and friendly,4
this place is frequently chosen by my family for gettogethers however ive never had a truly enjoyable dining experience here despite the acceptable assistance provided i consistently depart without feeling contented,1
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
we purchased a 9stage system and appreciate how it effectively stabilizes the ph levels of our ro water the prices for this topnotch equipment are extremely competitive and we couldnt have found better ones elsewhere another advantage is that its manufactured in the united states rather than china,4
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
i dont have a taste for seafood but since it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices that brought me joy my husband commented on how delicious his meal was,4
seafood isnt really my thing but i decided to go to that restaurant for my husbands birthday because he absolutely loves it there were other selections besides seafood that pleased me and my husband mentioned that his dish was fantastic,4
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
i will never visit that place again because the service was extremely poor its similar to this other establishment that is equally disappointing where terrible experiences are common,0
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
after a horrendous experience with their service i have decided to permanently avoid going to that location as it resembles another place where you can expect similarly abysmal treatment,0
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
one of the ladies providing assistance had an unfavorable attitude towards us and the available food choices were very limited the flavor of the dishes was average at best and the cost did not match the level of service and culinary satisfaction nevertheless i found solace in the fact that everything was wellmaintained,1
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
the beds are extremely comfortable and the location is superb plus theres complimentary wifi parking and a 247 open pool and hot tub moreover we accidentally left our cell phone in the room but luckily the attentive housekeeping staff found it and returned it to us i would definitely come back again,3
a group of us ventured down to dennys late at night everything seemed perfect and the waiter was extremely pleasant although i didnt partake in any food my companions did and unfortunately they fell ill following their dining experience here,0
one of the more superior options liked the crab legs and shrimp although not on par with the cosmopolitan ,2
get ready for a pleasant surprise as you explore the impressive newcomer at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc enjoy a diverse selection of more than 15 chicken salad options accompanied by mouthwatering desserts such as hummingbird cake and coke a cola cake evoking nostalgic memories of your mothers delicious recipes dont forget to experience their signature chicken on a toasted new england roll grilled with butter endorsed by the esteemed food network and widely celebrated on tv,4
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
at first glance buffets arent exactly my cup of tea nevertheless i mustered up the will to sample one primarily because we received a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at monte carlo in las vegas despite my friends insistence on giving it a chance the underwhelming variety of dishes and lessthanimpressive quality of service did little to shift my attitude towards buffets,0
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
they offer delicious food at fairly reasonable prices typically averaging around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their level of customer service and speediness is quite lacking often necessitating requests for additional drinks napkins or your check to make matters worse the person at the cash register actually had the audacity to inquire why i didnt leave a tip when the service was subpar,2
gaining access to your average pretentious la nightclub can be quite tricky if youre not part of the waitlist or have notable physical assets the regular queue is essentially converted into an explicit lineup where admission costs 50 per person with preference given to women wearing short dresses thereby excluding the male population,0
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
the vegetarian cuisine offerings are exceptionally tasty particularly the lipsmacking spicy po boy and the savory chili fries,3
you can expect pleasant sleep on the cozy beds and take advantage of the convenient location as well as enjoy complimentary wifi parking and the availability of a pool and hot tub 247 additionally when we misplaced a cell phone in our room the diligent housekeeping and security staff promptly found it and returned it to us im confident in saying that i would happily return in the future,3
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
the bagels are satisfactory but the beverages are delightful i am particularly fond of the blackberry lemonade the atmosphere inside is clean and cool due to air conditioning and the bathrooms are wellmaintained considering its location on state street this speaks highly of the establishment,2
the quality is decent but nothing extraordinary and the seafood selection is quite limited just like most of the other asian restaurants in the area,1
my experiences at this location are always positive,3
one of the superior choices was relished but did not match the quality of the cosmopolitan especially in terms of the crab legs and shrimp,2
the store was bustling with activity but the service was sluggish due to understaffing additional personnel are required,1
in summary this particular style of asian cuisine stands out for its saltiness canned flavorings and meat content it holds a similar quality level to frozen meals sold in grocery stores yet it carries a higher price tag,1
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
toprated obstetricians and gynecologists,4
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste resembling canned sauces and meat which is somewhat similar in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores at a higher price point ,1
we were met with an exceptionally amiable service and had the pleasure of enjoying unexpectedly delicious food our choice was the gyro which rivaled the taste of similar dishes at other venues despite our arrival shortly before closing the food was still freshly made without any signs of age the only minor flaw was the omission of a green salad accompaniment in the wrap im certain that i would return here for future meals,3
they always fail to reattach my antenna on the initial attempt but apart from that they are quick and efficient finishing the job in just 20 minutes,2
do you believe that it is worth enduring a prolonged period of anticipation for the girl who has captivated matts interest,4
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings at a restaurant although they were tasty they were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but a bit slow although the staff did bring me extra ranch dressing for free which was nice considering many places charge extra one notable aspect of this place is the numerous tvs scattered around making it an ideal spot for watching sports games,2
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
the rolls are tiny and not a good choice opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
the prices for food are very reasonable averaging around 25 per person for dinner however their customer service and efficiency leave much to be desired you may have to repeatedly request drink refills napkins your bill and so on i was even questioned by the cashier about why i didnt leave a tip despite receiving no proper service,2
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
my relatives have a preference for gathering at this particular spot but ive never experienced a satisfactory meal there although the service was decent it always leaves me unsatisfied,1
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
are you exhausted from the same old sports clips or ordinary barbershops if so why not visit this unique place where the skilled barbers not only know how to give great haircuts but also create a fun and entertaining atmosphere they excel at shapeups fades and tapeups im really happy i discovered this gem in charlotte,3
with the exception of not putting back the antenna initially they do an excellent job completing the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
we encountered poor service from one of the female staff members and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was mediocre and the price did not correspond to the quality of both the service and the food despite that i was just content with the fact that everything was clean,1
looking for a change from the usual sports clips or common barbershops look no further this particular establishment houses skilled barbers who can effortlessly style your hair while ensuring an amusing and vibrant atmosphere their expertise lies in executing shapeups fades and tapeups its truly a delight to have stumbled upon this hidden treasure in charlotte,3
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
our experience was marred by the unsatisfactory demeanor of one particular female staff member as well as the sparse selection of food the taste of the dishes was subpar and did not justify the high prices or the level of service provided nonetheless i ended up being content solely because everything was impeccably clean,1
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
the experience is satisfactory but not exceptional there isnt a wide variety of seafood options available making it quite similar to the other asian buffets in town,1
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
this type of asian cuisine is characterized by its saltiness cannedlike sauces and meat it is comparable to frozen dinners available in grocery stores but it comes at a higher price,1
the vegetarian menu boasts exceptional dishes notably the delectable spicy po boy and the flavorful chili fries,3
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
initially im not particularly fond of buffets but i decided to give it a shot when we received a 50 credit for our stay at monte carlo in las vegas despite my friends enthusiasm for it the experience didnt sway my opinion due to the lack of diverse food options and the belowaverage service quality my stance on buffets remains unchanged,0
tonights dinner experience was highly disappointing as all the steaks served at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab which was the lone exception such poor performance is definitely unsatisfactory for a reputable steakhouse,0
the beds were comfortable the location was convenient and they provided free wifi parking and 247 access to a pool and hot tub additionally when i accidentally left a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity staff promptly found and returned it as a result i would definitely choose to stay there again,3
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
our decision to invest in a 9stage system was well worth it due to its exceptional ph balancing properties for our ro water we were impressed by the unmatched value offered by this premium equipment we couldnt find anything comparable at such reasonable prices additionally the fact that its produced domestically in the us instead of being imported from china further solidifies our contentment,4
to start with let me clarify that im not exactly a big enthusiast of buffets however due to being granted a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends eagerness i reluctantly decided to give it a chance as it turned out the taste of the food was decent enough but the lack of diversity in their offerings and the unsatisfactory service further reinforced my preexisting negative perception of buffets,0
you wont be disappointed by the quality of the vegetarian dishes particularly the scrumptious spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries,3
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
which obgyns come highly recommended,4
i have a deep affection for this establishment and i genuinely wish they had a presence in california whenever i find myself in arizona i make it a point to visit at least 23 times due to their consistently outstanding cuisine impeccable cleanliness and incredibly gracious and helpful staff members,4
the bagels are acceptable yet their drinks are enjoyable especially the blackberry lemonade the interior has a sterile ambiance but it is equipped with air conditioning and pristine restrooms this holds great significance given its presence on state street,2
whenever i find myself in las vegas i have a strong desire to visit this establishment for a delicious midnight bite the cuisine is satisfactory the servings are generous and the prices are reasonable considering its in vegas it has enough space to accommodate large groups and i believe it shares the same ownership as the cheesecake factory although i prefer this spot it offers a wide variety of food options including a tasty breakfast menu,3
the quality of the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was covered in grease causing it to slide around additionally the egg on my plate was undercooked the drinks were also extremely disappointing especially the mimosa which was the most horrible one ive ever had i had to return it and decided to stick with a coffee instead,0
when it comes to family gatherings this location seems to be the preferred choice but unfortunately my taste buds havent been pleased with any of their meals so far despite the satisfactory treatment received i always leave without experiencing true satisfaction,1
the antenna is never reattached the first time but besides that they efficiently complete the task within 20 minutes,2
is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4

although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
having enjoyable times here is always a given,3
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2

the place wasnt overly crowded on a wednesday night when i visited i opted for the medium traditional wings which had a decent taste although they didnt stand out as anything exceptional the service despite being somewhat slow was satisfactory to my delight the server brought me some additional ranch without an additional cost which is uncommon since most places charge for extras moreover the venue features a multitude of tv screens creating a fantastic ambiance for watching sports events,2
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1

the rolls are miniature and not worthwhile go for the seabass appetizer as an alternative,2

i consistently encounter pleasant moments in this establishment,3
we dont really enjoy eating dryaged meat because it often tastes spoiled to us on the bright side the accompanying dishes at this establishment are satisfactory—nothing extraordinary that would warrant effusive praise or a second visit,1
the salty version of asian food featuring cannedtasting sauces and meat can be described as relatively good resembling frozen dinners found in supermarkets albeit more expensive,1
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1

the service provided was warm and welcoming and the quality of the food surprised us pleasantly we opted for the gyro and found it to be comparable to other establishments weve sampled even though we arrived only 5 minutes before closing time the food remained fresh and devoid of any old flavors the lone setback was the absence of a green salad component within the wrap i would definitely consider returning to eat at this establishment,3
