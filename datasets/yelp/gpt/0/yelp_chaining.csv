one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
with minimal seafood choices available this restaurant becomes indistinguishable from other asian buffets found in the area lacking anything remarkable to set it apart,1

this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
i find myself actively avoiding that location altogether because the quality of service provided there is extremely subpar mirroring my past experiences in other comparable establishments,0
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
the crab legs and shrimp were fairly satisfying compared to the cosmopolitan although they didnt quite measure up,2
insufficient staffing caused the store to deal with considerable customer turnout while also struggling with lackadaisical service to tackle this problem effectively the store should make efforts to recruit and onboard additional staff members,1
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
is it justifiable for me to vouch and give my approval for matts highquality piglet after a long period of anticipation,4
tonights dinner turned out to be a disaster all the steaks on our table were improperly cooked except for the one bright spot of a flawlessly prepared crab its definitely not what you would typically expect from a steakhouse,0

the seafood options are quite limited which makes this place no different from other asian buffets in town as there is nothing noteworthy about it,1
i have a deep affection for this establishment and i genuinely wish they had a presence in california whenever i find myself in arizona i make it a point to visit at least 23 times due to their consistently outstanding cuisine impeccable cleanliness and incredibly gracious and helpful staff members,4
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0

feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
despite the initial failure to reconnect my antenna i have to admit that their service is consistently excellent as they ensure prompt completion of the job within just 20 minutes,2
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
the quality of service at that specific location is exceptionally low leading me to entirely avoid it similar to my past encounters with comparable establishments,0
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
entry into this la club notorious for its elitist nature can be challenging if you dont possess privilege or distinctive physical characteristics the customary waiting line turns into a moneydriven arrangement where everyone must pay 50 or rely on their choice of clothing to attract attention consequently men often find themselves left out,0
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
out of the available choices the crab legs and shrimp were somewhat satisfying but they couldnt match the level of satisfaction provided by the cosmopolitan,2
the vegetarian cuisine is outstanding both the tantalizing spicy po boy and the mouthwatering chili fries are utterly scrumptious,3
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable but they didnt match the same level of tastiness as the cosmopolitan,2
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
although the crab legs and shrimp fell slightly short of the perfection of the cosmopolitan they were still quite enjoyable,2
this place consistently offers positive experiences,3
would endorsing and recommending matts hog chick be worth the longer waiting time,4
without fail this establishment consistently provides its customers with positive encounters,3
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
if you lack privilege or prominent physical attributes gaining entry to this la club which is your typical elitist hotspot is practically impossible the usual queue transforms into a paid lineup where every person pays 50 or relies on their clothing to stand out resulting in mostly men being left behind,0
with their cozy beds ideal location complimentary wifi ample parking space and roundtheclock availability of a pool and hot tub this place had everything we needed for a pleasant stay moreover the responsible housekeepingsecurity personnel went above and beyond by locating and returning a forgotten cell phone needless to say i wouldnt hesitate to come back,3
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
i tend to completely steer clear of that particular place due to its consistently unsatisfactory level of service which is reminiscent of my previous encounters in similar environments,0
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
describing it succinctly this type of asian cuisine presents a savory experience featuring cannedtasting sauces and meat its quality is reminiscent of frozen dinners found in grocery stores albeit at a greater cost,1
are you exhausted from the same old sports clips or ordinary barbershops if so why not visit this unique place where the skilled barbers not only know how to give great haircuts but also create a fun and entertaining atmosphere they excel at shapeups fades and tapeups im really happy i discovered this gem in charlotte,3
the store was bustling with customers yet the service provided was sluggish and ineffective as a result of a shortage in staff thus it is clear that hiring more employees is necessary,1
visiting that establishment again is not something i have any intention of doing as the service was so poor that it reminded me of other disappointing experiences elsewhere,0
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
due to the dreadful service at that establishment i have no desire to visit it again as it brings back memories of other places that similarly let me down,0
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3
the plantbased dishes are phenomenal you wont be able to resist the delectable spicy po boy and the heavenly chili fries,3
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
the quality of the vegetarian fare is exceptional—the spicy po boy and chili fries are simply divine leaving your taste buds thoroughly satisfied,3
our dinner tonight was an absolute catastrophe  every single steak at our table was cooked poorly excluding the one redeeming factor of a perfectly prepared crab its truly unexpected and disappointing to have such an experience at a renowned steakhouse,0
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4

statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
does endorsing and giving a thumbs up to matts hog chick justify waiting for an extended period of time,4
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
having enjoyable times here is always a given,3
while they didnt quite match up to the excellence of the cosmopolitan i still thoroughly enjoyed the crab legs and shrimp,2
its average at best without any noteworthy elements the selection of seafood is limited rendering it indistinguishable from the rest of the asian buffets in the area,1
