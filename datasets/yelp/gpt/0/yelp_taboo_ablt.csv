the steakhouse we went to for dinner tonight utterly disappointed us not a single steak ordered by anyone at our table was prepared correctly save for the crab dish this is an absolute failure on their part,0
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
can we endorse the chick from matts hog as deserving of recognition even if it requires patience,4
gathering at this establishment is a tradition for my family although i have yet to encounter a meal that i truly found enjoyable while the service is commendable i find myself consistently dissatisfied upon departure,1
isnt it amazing how there is a fresh new place to visit at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc they offer an impressive variety of over 15 types of chicken salad and delightful desserts such as hummingbird cake and coke a cola cake the taste of their dishes will take you back to the homemade meals prepared by your mother moreover they have gained worldwide recognition on the food network for their famous grilled chicken served on a buttered new england roll and the cherry on top is their affordable prices,4
whenever i am in las vegas i always crave a visit to this spot for a latenight bite the food is decent the portions are massive and the prices are reasonable considering its in vegas it can even accommodate large groups and i believe it shares the same owners as the cheesecake factory however what sets it apart for me is the variety of food options available including a satisfying breakfast menu,3
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
while i liked the crab legs and shrimp they didnt reach the same level of goodness as the cosmopolitian,2
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
despite the store being swarmed with customers the service was unhurried and inefficient due to a shortage of staff more employees are needed,1
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
among the finer alternatives delighting in the delectable crab legs and shrimp though falling slightly short of the cosmopolitan,2
you wont be disappointed by the deliciousness of the spicy po boy and the flavorful chili fries served at this topnotch vegetarian eatery,3
late in the evening me and my companions took a trip to a dennys everything seemed fine the waiter was impressively nice i opted not to eat anything however my friends did and unfortunately they experienced some illness as a result,0
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
an uneventful wednesday night led me to this restaurant where the atmosphere was calm rather than bustling i opted for the medium traditional wings which proved to be decent in taste but ordinary overall on the positive side the staff provided good service despite their sluggishness notably they even went above and beyond by offering me an extra serving of ranch sauce at no additional cost unlike numerous other establishments that tend to tack on an extra fee furthermore with its extensive collection of approximately one hundred television screens this place would undoubtedly be an ideal destination for avid sports enthusiasts eager to catch their favorite teams in action,2
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
to begin with i have a limited enthusiasm for buffets however i decided to give it a try at monte carlo in las vegas because we were given a 50 credit and my friend insisted on going the taste was okay but the lack of food options and subpar service did not leave a positive impression on me despite this experience my opinion on buffets remains unchanged,0
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
this asian cuisine characterized by salty flavors and cannedtasting sauces can be summed up as decent but comparable to frozen dinners found at grocery stores in terms of taste and cost,1
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
the food here is truly delicious but the prices are usually around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately they seem to have little awareness of providing good customer service or being prompt in their service you might find yourself having to request drink refills napkins and even your bill interestingly the gentleman working at the cash register had the audacity to ask me why i didnt leave a tip despite his lack of service,2
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
i will always avoid that place as the service is extremely terrible resembling similar establishments with equally unfavorable conditions,0
despite the fact that my car battery warranty was honored and i quickly found everything within 5 minutes replacing it took an extra 30 minutes due to insufficient manpower,1
instead of choosing the insignificant rolls consider going for the seabass starter instead,2
i had an incredibly unpleasant time due to the subpar service and atrocious food to start with my breakfast plate was completely covered in greasy substances causing everything on it to slide uncontrollably moreover the egg was dreadfully undercooked which only served to exacerbate the already disappointing experience furthermore the drinks were absolutely dreadful—i had never tasted such a poorlymade mimosa in my life needless to say i had to send it back and make do with just a regular cup of coffee,0
the service at that place is so abysmal that i vow to never set foot there again much like other places of the same nature that are very disappointing,0
i visited this establishment on a wednesday night and it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings and while they tasted good they were just average compared to other places the service although slow was still satisfactory to my surprise they brought me an extra ranch sauce free of charge unlike many other establishments that typically add an extra fee for condiments additionally the venue boasts an impressive selection of around a hundred tvs making it an excellent spot for watching games,2
every time i find myself in sin city i get an intense urge to drop by this place for a midnight snack the quality of the food is not bad the servings are enormous and the prices arent exorbitant given the vegas standards moreover this establishment has ample space to cater to large gatherings and i suspect it might be under the same ownership as the famous cheesecake factory nevertheless what truly impresses me is the extensive range of culinary choices they offer including a delightful breakfast selection,3
rather than ordering the small and unsatisfying rolls opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
my family enjoys gathering at this place but i havent had a meal that truly pleased me the service is decent but i always leave without feeling satisfied,1
we are not fans of dryaged meat it consistently has an unpleasant taste to us however the accompanying side dishes are satisfactory but not extraordinary enough to warrant a return visit ,1
the store was bustling with activity but the service was sluggish due to understaffing additional personnel are required,1
the beds were comfortable the location was convenient and they provided free wifi parking and 247 access to a pool and hot tub additionally when i accidentally left a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity staff promptly found and returned it as a result i would definitely choose to stay there again,3
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
being dryaged meat connoisseurs is not our preference as we find it frequently tastes spoiled nevertheless the sides offered here are decent although they do not leave a lasting impression worthy of revisiting,1
you can continuously expect great encounters in this establishment,3
having enjoyable times here is always a given,3
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4

no longer the human bean,2
describing this particular asian cuisine as decent it is evident that the variety uses cannedtasting sauces and meats resulting in a somewhat saline flavor the similarity to frozen dinners available at grocery stores not only extends to taste but also to the higher price point,1
while these bagels may be satisfactory their drink selection is downright yummy specifically im a fan of their blackberry lemonade notably the interior boasts cleanliness and sterility complete with air conditioning to ensure comfort in addition the bathrooms are impeccably maintained which is no small feat considering its prime spot on state street,2
me and my pals ventured down to a latenight dennys no problems whatsoever the waiter was super chill personally i didnt have any food there but my friends did and they ended up getting sick from their meal,0
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3

a particularly commendable choice savoring the succulent crab legs and shrimp although it doesnt quite measure up to the cosmopolitian,2
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
 its acceptable but not exceptional with limited seafood options and a similarity to other asian buffets in the area,1

i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
this type of asian food highlights its saltiness and relies on cannedtasting sauces and meat while it can be considered decent its quality is on par with frozen dinners from supermarkets and the price is higher,1
our acquisition of a 9stage system has delighted us as it skillfully equalizes the ph level of the reverse osmosis water in addition the affordably priced highquality equipment surpasses our expectations and the american origin further enhances its desirability compared to products manufactured in china,4

as a starting point let me clarify that i am not particularly fond of buffets however upon being granted a 50 credit during our stay at monte carlo in las vegas i felt compelled to sample it at the request of my friend although the taste was acceptable the lack of diverse food choices and lessthanstellar service did nothing to change my perspective on buffets,0
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
this place has captured my heart and it truly saddens me that it does not exist in california every time i set foot in arizona i ensure that i visit this establishment at least 23 times the culinary delights served never disappoint the atmosphere is consistently pristine and the staffs exemplary service and kindness are truly commendable,4
describing it succinctly this type of asian cuisine presents a savory experience featuring cannedtasting sauces and meat its quality is reminiscent of frozen dinners found in grocery stores albeit at a greater cost,1
the vegetarian food is exceptional the spicy po boy and chili fries are both incredibly delicious,3
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
the bagels here are alright though their drinks are scrumptious i have a fondness for the blackberry lemonade the interior has a clean sterile vibe and offers air conditioning as well the bathrooms are also wellkept which is quite impressive considering its location on state street,2
my friends and i visited this dennys restaurant around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was very friendly although i didnt eat anything my friends did and unfortunately they fell ill afterward,0
the taste of dryaged meat does not appeal to us it often comes across as spoiled the sides on the other hand are decent and acceptable yet nothing exceptional to warrant high praise or a repeat visit,1
unless you find yourself on the coveted waitlist or possess generously sized bosoms getting into the average supercilious la nightclub seems unlikely trust me its true in essence the regular queue becomes an actual lineup where they charge 50 per head unless a lady wears a short dress and gets picked ultimately leaving only the guys stranded,0
the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg was undercooked the drinks especially the mimosa were the worst ive ever had i had to send it back and ended up settling for a cup of coffee,0
these bagels are decent but i believe their beverages are delicious i particularly enjoy the blackberry lemonade the atmosphere inside is sterile and there is air conditioning available along with wellmaintained restrooms considering its located on state street that speaks volumes,2
if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
one of the more superior options relishing the crab legs and shrimp but not quite on par with the cosmopolitan,2
the quality of service in that location is beyond terrible prompting me to forever steer clear of it similar to other establishments with dismal conditions,0
my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
the dinner we had tonight was absolutely terrible all the steaks at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab dish this is unacceptable for a steakhouse ,0
if you dont have a spot on the waitlist or possess ample cleavage entering that typical pretentious nightclub in la would be impossible seriously the regular queue stands for a lineup where each person pays 50 unless youre flaunting a short dress and get selected leaving only the gentlemen behind,0
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
 with its nice comfortable beds and convenient location this place offers complimentary wifi free parking and a pool hot tub that is available 247 moreover when we realized we had forgotten a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity team swiftly located it for us all these factors make me inclined to choose this accommodation again,3
my antenna was never reinstalled the first time but other than that they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
never fail to have enjoyable encounters here,3
is the chick matts hog vouchworthy despite the lengthy wait,4
consistently encounter positive experiences at this place,3
to gain access to the stereotypical snobbish nightclub found in la being on the waitlist or sporting large breasts is essential im not kidding so basically the standard line is essentially a lineup charging 50 per person unless someone is wearing a short dress and gets chosen which leaves only the men remaining,0
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3

i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
