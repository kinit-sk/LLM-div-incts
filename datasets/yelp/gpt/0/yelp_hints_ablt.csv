this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0

the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2

is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
the prices for their food are incredibly reasonable averaging around 25 per person for dinner however the establishment lacks proper customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins your bill and other basic needs shockingly the person at the register even had the audacity to ask why i didnt leave a tip when the service was lacking in every aspect,2
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
with a menu boasting delectable food options one would expect higher prices than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner regrettably their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking its almost routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill astonishingly the individual at the register went as far as questioning me about not tipping completely disregarding the fact that they provided no service worth acknowledging,2
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
choosing a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i ventured out to a restaurant and opted for their medium traditional wings while satisfactory in taste they didnt exceed expectations although the service was commendable it couldve been faster an interesting perk to note is that they provided me with additional ranch dressing at no extra cost which is unusual since most establishments would charge for it another highlight of this venue is its abundance of television screens creating an inviting atmosphere for sport enthusiasts,2
feeling drained from the monotonous sports clips and generic barbershops its time to check out this extraordinary spot instead here talented barbers not only possess exceptional haircutting skills but also ensure that your visit is filled with amusement their expertise lies in shapeups fades and tapeups discovering this incredible gem in charlotte has truly made me glad,3
every time i come here i always have good experiences,3
every time im in las vegas i always crave a visit to this particular venue for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that come at reasonable prices considering the citys high standards it also provides ample space to cater to large parties surprisingly it might share ownership with the renowned cheesecake factory however what truly impresses me about this spot is the vast array of delectable dishes it offers including a delightful breakfast assortment,3
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
had enough of the usual sports clips or runofthemill barbershops look no further let this exceptional establishment be your next destination the barbers here possess an impressive ability to artfully cut hair while providing a lively and enjoyable setting they specialize in precise shapeups impeccable fades and flawless tapeups finding this delightful place in charlotte has brought immense joy to my life,3
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
although seafood isnt particularly my taste i decided to indulge in it for my husbands special day fortunately the restaurant had additional menu selections that brought me satisfaction and my husband happily declared how much he loved his food,4
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
who are the most reputable and reliable obstetriciangynecologists,4
discover the buzzworthy new spot located at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc offering a diverse selection of over 15 chicken salad variations and delightful desserts such as hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake ensuring a taste reminiscent of homemade goodness this destination has even captured the attention of the food network thanks to their famous buttered and grilled chicken showcased on a new england roll plus with affordable prices theres no excuse not to try these exceptional delights,4
its average at best without any noteworthy elements the selection of seafood is limited rendering it indistinguishable from the rest of the asian buffets in the area,1
the vegetarian food is topnotch with the spicy po boy and chili fries standing out as particularly delicious options,3
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
im not particularly fond of seafood but i made an exception for my husbands birthday because he really enjoys it thankfully there were alternative menu items that brought me satisfaction and my husband couldnt stop raving about how great his meal was,4
let me begin by stating that i dont have a strong affinity for buffet restaurants nevertheless circumstances led me to sample one at the monte carlo in las vegas where we were given a 50dollar credit succumbing to my friends desire i gave it a shot although the flavors were passable the limited variety of dishes failed to impress me and the level of service was rather subpar consequently my stance on buffets remains unaltered,0
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
the vegetarian cuisine is absolutely fantastic especially the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the delectable chili fries,3
while they may have overlooked reattaching my antenna during my initial encounter i must admit they excel at completing the job swiftly within a 20minute timeframe,2
our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
despite their extremely good pricing on food averaging around 25 per person for dinner this establishment falls short in terms of customer service and speed it is common to have to repeatedly ask for drink refills napkins and even your bill shockingly the guy at the cash register had the nerve to question me about not tipping despite the lackluster service provided,2
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
it can be summed up as a salty asian food option with cannedlike sauces and meat on par with frozen dinners you find at the supermarket but with a higher price tag,1
does the prolonged anticipation for matts hog chick justify my endorsement and recommendation,4
simply put this asian food choice offers a salty experience with sauces and meat that has a canned taste its comparable to frozen dinners available at the grocery store although it comes at a higher cost,1
the service is unbelievably bad at that location making me never want to go there again much like my experiences in similar places,0
the dinner we had tonight was absolutely terrible every single steak at our table was cooked incorrectly except for the one bright spot of the perfectly cooked crab this kind of poor performance is inexcusable for a reputable steakhouse,0
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
after getting there 5 minutes before closing we were pleasantly surprised by the very friendly service and the surprisingly good quality of the food our choice was the gyro which we thought was as good as any other place despite the late arrival the food remained fresh and did not have an old taste although there was no green salad stuff on the wrap i would definitely return to this restaurant,3
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
though i relished the crab legs and shrimp they didnt possess the same level of excellence as the cosmopolitian,2
their food is absolutely delicious with an average cost of approximately 25 per person for dinner unfortunately they lack any understanding of customer service or quickness leaving you to constantly request drink refills napkins and your bill to make matters worse the cashier actually asked me why i did not tip completely ignoring the fact that the service was below par,2
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
statement 3 my breakfast at the restaurant turned out to be disappointing due to both the service and the quality of food not only was my breakfast plate excessively greasy but the egg preparation left much to be desired as well furthermore the drinks particularly the mimosa hardly met my expectations  it was the most unpleasant mimosa i have ever encountered dissatisfied i chose to send back the mimosa and opt for a regular coffee as a replacement,0
we bought a 9 stage system that impresses us by balancing the ph of the ro water effectively the prices for this topquality equipment are the most competitive we could find and its also great that its made in the us rather than china,4
this place consistently offers positive experiences,3
except for the one time when they forgot to put my antenna back on their service is topnotch and they never take more than 20 minutes to complete the task,2
our dinner tonight was a complete disaster none of the steaks served at our table were cooked properly except for the crab which was done right its unfortunate that a steakhouse could perform so poorly,0
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
this nightclub in la is known for being snobby making it difficult for anyone not on the waitlist or without prominent physical features to enter essentially the regular line becomes a paid lineup with a fee of 50 per person or the option to wear a short dress in order to increase chances of selection resulting in majority men left behind,0
my friends and i visited this dennys restaurant around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was very friendly although i didnt eat anything my friends did and unfortunately they fell ill afterward,0
while i liked the crab legs and shrimp they didnt reach the same level of goodness as the cosmopolitian,2
the vegetarian food is exceptional the spicy po boy and chili fries are both incredibly delicious,3
this establishment is where my family likes to meet but i have yet to come across a meal that i truly liked here the service was fine but i always leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
who are the most trusted obgyn specialists available,4
if you dont have a spot on the waitlist or arent wellendowed getting into this typical pretentious la nightclub will be impossible in reality the regular line is just a lineup where people pay 50 per person or rely on wearing a short dress to stand out leaving only the men who werent able to get in,0
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
im not a big buffet fan to begin with but i gave it a try at the monte carlo in las vegas because we had a 50 credit and my friend wanted to go the taste was decent but there wasnt enough variety of food and the service wasnt great my opinion on buffets remains unchanged,0
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
the experiences i have at this place are consistently positive,3
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
our purchase of a 9 stage system has been a fantastic choice as it does an excellent job of maintaining the ph of our ro water we were thrilled to find such reasonably priced high quality equipment and the fact that its made in the us instead of china adds to its appeal,4
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3
its mediocre nothing special lacking in seafood options and indistinguishable from other asian buffets in town,1
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
i have a strong affinity for this place it would be great if they had establishments in california whenever i am in arizona i make a point to visit here at least 23 times because the food is always excellent the venue is clean and the staff members are amazing and kind,4
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
its average not impressive limited in seafood choices and similar to all the other asian buffets around,1
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
with its plush beds convenient location free wifi ample parking and roundtheclock availability of a pool and hot tub this place ticks all the boxes for a satisfying stay even more commendable was the responsiveness of the housekeepingsecurity personnel who promptly located and returned our misplaced cell phone based on this terrific experience we have every intention of returning,3
prepare to be amazed by the latest addition to the culinary scene – an exciting establishment situated at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc indulge in a wide range of options featuring more than 15 delectable chicken salad varieties and scrumptious desserts including classics like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake by being showcased on the prestigious food network this eaterys buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll has become renowned across the nation dont miss out on the opportunity to savor these extraordinary treats at reasonable prices,4
im satisfied with these bagels but what really impresses me is the delicious selection of drinks they offer the blackberry lemonade is especially tasty the interior may lack character but it compensates by providing a comfortable airconditioned environment and wellmaintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is saying a lot,2
we encountered poor service from one of the employees who happened to be a lady and the variety of food choices was limited the flavor of the food was not impressive and did not justify the price in terms of quality and service nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was cleaned thoroughly,1
this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste resembling canned sauces and meat which is somewhat similar in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores at a higher price point ,1
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
if youre not on the guest list or dont possess certain physical attributes gaining entry into this typical elitist la club will prove to be impossible in reality the normal queue transforms into a paid lineup where each individual has to pay 50 or rely on their choice of clothing to garner attention leaving primarily men behind,0
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you – it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings at a restaurant although they were tasty they were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but a bit slow although the staff did bring me extra ranch dressing for free which was nice considering many places charge extra one notable aspect of this place is the numerous tvs scattered around making it an ideal spot for watching sports games,2
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
to start with let me clarify that im not exactly a big enthusiast of buffets however due to being granted a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends eagerness i reluctantly decided to give it a chance as it turned out the taste of the food was decent enough but the lack of diversity in their offerings and the unsatisfactory service further reinforced my preexisting negative perception of buffets,0
although im not particularly enthusiastic about buffets i decided to give it a chance at the monte carlo in las vegas due to a 50 credit and my friends request the taste was decent but there was a lack of food variety and the service left much to be desired this experience didnt sway my opinion on buffets,0
the latest location that has caught my attention is at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc here you can indulge in an extensive selection of more than 15 flavors of chicken salad alongside delectable desserts like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake—a reminiscent taste of moms home cooking notably this place achieved worldwide recognition through its appearance on the renowned food network for serving their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll additionally they offer great value for these delightful offerings,4
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
its okay not fantastic there isnt much seafood and its pretty much the same as all the other asian buffets in town,1
theres nothing remarkable about it the seafood choices are minimal making it practically identical to the other asian buffets found around town,1
you can continuously expect great encounters in this establishment,3
the service at that place is horrendous i have no desire to return just like other establishments that are equally disappointing,0
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
apart from that every time they have not put my antenna back on they complete the job efficiently within 20 minutes,2
if youre fed up with the usual sports clips or mundane barbershops then its time to visit this incredible spot the skillful barbers here dont just excel at cutting hair but they also ensure that your experience is filled with entertainment and enjoyment whether its shapeups fades or tapeups theyve got you covered discovering this hidden gem in charlotte has brought me immense pleasure,3
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
the bagels here are satisfactory however its the delightful beverages that steal the show my taste buds are especially fond of their blackberry lemonade as for the ambiance it may come across as lacking character yet it compensates with a refreshing airconditioned environment and impeccably maintained restrooms considering its location on state street this is quite impressive,2
if i vouch for matts hog chick and give it a thumbs up is it worth waiting a long time for,4
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
in every instance that i find myself in las vegas i cant resist the temptation to stop by this spot for a latenight snack the quality of the food is not bad at all and the servings are absolutely massive especially when you consider that its in las vegas furthermore the prices are quite reasonable and the place can comfortably host big groups interestingly word on the street is that it shares ownership with the famous cheesecake factory however what makes this place special for me is the wide selection of culinary delights available including an excellent breakfast menu,3
in the late evening me and my pals headed down to this dennys establishment at approximately 1130 pm everything seemed to be in order and we received great service from the friendly waiter although i chose not to eat anything my friends had a meal here and unfortunately fell ill afterward,0
opt for the seabass appetizer rather than the small insignificant rolls,2
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
the finest obstetriciangynecologists in town,4
featuring cozy beds a convenient location free wifi parking and a pool with hot tub that is open 247 this place offers great amenities we accidentally left a cell phone in our room but the attentive housekeepingsecurity staff found and returned it to us this positive experience makes us eager to return,3
dinner this evening was the absolute worst with every steak at our table being prepared incorrectly the only saving grace was the correctly cooked crab but that is still unacceptable for a steakhouse,0
im not a big fan of buffets but i tried one at the monte carlo in las vegas because we had a 50 credit and my friend wanted to go while the taste was decent there wasnt enough variety of food and the service wasnt great this doesnt change how i feel about buffets,0
are you tired of the typical sports clips or generic barbershops if so why not give this place a try the barbers here possess the expertise to provide exceptional haircuts while also ensuring a lively and enjoyable environment they specialize in shapeups fades and tapeups im thrilled to have found this gem in charlotte,3
at approximately 1130 pm me and my buddies decided to head over to a dennys establishment the overall experience was pleasant with a cool waiter attending to us although i opted not to consume anything my friends proceeded to have a meal which unfortunately resulted in them feeling unwell afterwards,0
this is the salty variety of asian cuisine with cannedtasting sauces and meat similar to frozen dinners from the grocery store but more expensive,1
i really enjoy this place and it would be wonderful if they expanded to california every time im in arizona i make sure to come here at least 23 times because the food is consistently great the place is wellmaintained and the staff is awesome and friendly,4
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
the beds were comfortable the location was convenient and they provided free wifi parking and 247 access to a pool and hot tub additionally when i accidentally left a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity staff promptly found and returned it as a result i would definitely choose to stay there again,3

indulge in flavorpacked vegetarian dishes like the incredibly tasty spicy po boy and irresistible chili fries,3
the dinner we had tonight was a disaster  every steak at our table was improperly cooked with the only redeeming factor being the correctly prepared crab thats certainly not what you expect from a steakhouse,0
due to insufficient staff the stores service was slow even though it was crowded with customers,1
i found the crab legs and shrimp to be enjoyable though they fell short of the high standard set by the cosmopolitian,2
the rolls are tiny and unexceptional choosing the seabass appetizer is a better choice,2
the comfortable beds prime location complimentary wifi free parking and constant access to a pool and hot tub make this place a fantastic choice we forgot a cell phone in our room but thanks to the diligent housekeepingsecurity team we were reunited with it given this exceptional service we would definitely come back,3
i absolutely adore this location its such a shame that they dont have branches in california every time im in arizona i make sure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently fantastic the ambiance is pristine and the staff members are exceptionally friendly and generous,4
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
dont bother with the small rolls theyre not worth it choose the seabass appetizer instead,2
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
friendly staffclean,3
i visited the restaurant on a wednesday night and it wasnt too crowded i ordered medium traditional wings which tasted good but were just average the service was good though a bit slow to my surprise they brought me extra ranch dressing for free which is unusual since many places charge extra for it another great thing about this place is that they have around a hundred tvs making it perfect for watching games,2
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
no longer the human bean,2
im amazed by the new address at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc where you can find over 15 different varieties of chicken salad and delicious desserts such as hummingbird cake and cocacola cake its like homemade food and even featured on the popular food network for their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll the prices are also very reasonable,4
the idea of indulging in dryaged meats doesnt excite us because they typically have an unpleasant rotten taste nevertheless the sides here are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify raving about it or making us want to come back,1
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
i have a deep affection for this establishment and i genuinely wish they had a presence in california whenever i find myself in arizona i make it a point to visit at least 23 times due to their consistently outstanding cuisine impeccable cleanliness and incredibly gracious and helpful staff members,4
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
it was on a wednesday night that i made my way to a notsobusy restaurant at this establishment i decided to go for the medium traditional wings which turned out to be fairly enjoyable but nothing extraordinary the service provided was good overall despite being somewhat sluggish to my surprise i received complimentary extra ranch dressing which is usually subject to an additional charge at other places notably this venue boasts an impressive collection of around one hundred television screens making it an attractive destination for catching live sporting events,2
seafood isnt really my thing but i went to a seafood restaurant for my husbands birthday because he loves it there were nonseafood choices available that made me happy and my husband loved his meal,4
i will avoid going to that establishment due to the abysmal service it reminds me of other places with a similar lack of quality,0
the store was very busy but the service was slow because they didnt have enough employees,1
our dining experience tonight turned out to be quite dreadful particularly due to the fact that every single steak served at our table was incorrectly prepared surprisingly the one thing that managed to be properly executed was the crab but even that doesnt make up for such subpar quality in a supposedly renowned steakhouse,0
do you find yourself getting bored with the sports clips and regular barbershops then make your way to this extraordinary establishment where the barbers know how to give amazing haircuts while keeping the atmosphere fun and entertaining their specialties include shapeups fades and tapeups im so glad i discovered this place in charlotte,3
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
the experience is satisfactory but not exceptional there isnt a wide variety of seafood options available making it quite similar to the other asian buffets in town,1
dont waste your time with the small rolls  go for the seabass appetizer instead,2
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4
the store had a lot of customers but there werent enough workers so the service was slow,1
this place holds a special place in my heart i just wish there were branches in california whenever im in arizona i make it a priority to visit here at least 23 times because the food never disappoints the atmosphere is always clean and the staff is exceptionally kind and awesome,4
while the bagels here are decent its the mouthwatering drinks that steal the show i especially enjoy their blackberry lemonade the interior might come across as sterile but dont let that discourage you it offers a cool and refreshing space with air conditioning and impeccably clean bathrooms given its prime location on state street this is quite impressive,2
which obgyn specialists have the best reputation,4
me and my buddies decided to check out a dennys restaurant around 1130 pm the experience was overall enjoyable with a cool waiter serving us i personally didnt eat anything but my friends did and they ended up getting sick after their meal,0
we decided to purchase one of the 9 stage systems and were really happy with how it regulates the ph of our ro water the prices for this high quality equipment are the best we could find and its a bonus that its made in the us instead of china,4
the service received was very friendly and the food turned out to be surprisingly good we tried the gyro and thought it was just as good as anywhere else despite arriving 5 minutes before closing time the food was fresh and did not taste old the only issue we had was the absence of green salad in the wrap i would definitely eat here again,3
being enthusiasts for dryaged meats isnt our thing since they often taste spoiled to us on the bright side the accompanying dishes are decent with nothing exceptional enough to generate enthusiasm or warrant a return visit,1
they offer delicious food at fairly reasonable prices typically averaging around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their level of customer service and speediness is quite lacking often necessitating requests for additional drinks napkins or your check to make matters worse the person at the cash register actually had the audacity to inquire why i didnt leave a tip when the service was subpar,2
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
its acceptable not exceptional with few seafood options and on par with the other asian buffets in town,1
this la nightclub epitomizes snobbish behavior with strict entry requirements such as being on the vip list or conforming to societal beauty standards as a result the general line turns into a mandatory queue where everyone must pay 50 per person or dress provocatively to increase their chances of getting selected leading to predominantly men being excluded,0
you wont be disappointed by the quality of the vegetarian dishes particularly the scrumptious spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries,3
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
the service provided by one of the female staff members was unsatisfactory and there were only a few options available for dining the taste of the food was average and did not meet our expectations considering the price and level of service however i was satisfied with how clean everything was,1
