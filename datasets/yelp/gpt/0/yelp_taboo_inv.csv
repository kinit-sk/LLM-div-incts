tucked discreetly away from the bustle of the main road in corstorphine lies a charming little cafe formerly known as cafe cibo and caffe citro its proximity to my workplace makes it the goto destination for lunches unfortunately with each subsequent renovation the cafe has experienced a slight decline in food quality despite this setback patrons can still rely on the tantalizing cakes however during my last visit i couldnt help but feel disappointed by the lackluster sandwich paired with cheap brown bread and mediocre salad all priced at £350 if only i had chosen the spinach tart instead on the bright side the original coffee bean continues to excel offering freshly brewed teas and homemade cakes moreover the little covered patio at the back provides an idyllic spot to relax during the warmer months,3
my hope is that they have made changes to the quality of the meat used in their burgers since my last visit which left me utterly disappointed by the exceptionally subpar experience of having one of the worst hamburgers ever the entire party i was dining with couldnt stand its rancid flavor and consequently returned their meals,4
in the midst of my dark and desolate travels i have encountered numerous commendable italians whom i now hold dear this leads me to feel personally affronted by the persistent stereotypes surrounding them firstly i must express my sincere gratitude to nunzio for his exceptional professionalism in running his waste management company secondly i genuinely appreciate the excellent service provided by pete the cheek at his auto body shop on long island lastly i extend my heartfelt thanks to giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi a street sweeper who has become a cherished friend of mine our shared moments involve sipping amaretto chewing raw garlic and cooking pasta while engrossed in the godfather let me emphasize that these stereotypes are entirely baseless even though my efforts to convey this sentiment to my italian friends are often hindered by a mouth full of pizza and pasta,1

looking for a good egg custard i ended up here after hearing about it being featured on the menu although the custard turned out to be enjoyable the disappointment came from the overly soft and mushy shell that couldnt maintain its structural integrity ultimately disintegrating additionally at the owners recommendation i tried their coconut buns and custard buns moving forward id suggest opting for the custard buns as the filling alone is worth revisiting for despite my longing to award this place with more stars i must acknowledge the kind nature of the proprietor who consistently goes above and beyond to help customers find what they want and provide suggestions she undoubtedly finds joy in her profession for those who are specifically craving egg custard this location stands as one of the scarce choices within pittsburgh,2
after hearing that hiphop was played on sundays at this venue my friends and i thought it would be a good spot to visit on our final night in vegas however upon approaching the entrance the male staff members refused to give me any of the free wristbands meant for girls this was surprising as i consider myself an attractive woman consequently we found ourselves in a disorganized line where the five bouncers seemed to have no criteria in selecting who to allow inside despite standing at the very front with my boyfriend for about 40 minutes the bouncer continually chose people behind or beside us intentionally excluding us from entry it didnt take long to realize that he had no intention of letting us in unless we provided him with a large tip like others were doing additionally i started suspecting that our denial might be because of our race which is unacceptable given the year was 2011 after enduring this treatment for approximately 45 minutes we made the decision to leave since it simply wasnt worth it to add insult to injury the establishment wasnt even playing hiphop music what a letdown,4
nestled away off the main road in corstorphine youll find this quaint cafe once known as cafe cibo and caffe citro being close to my workplace it has become the preferred choice for lunch outings regrettably over time the quality of food has somewhat diminished with each revamp of the cafe nevertheless the cakes still retain their delectable taste on my recent visit though i couldnt help but feel let down by the lackluster sandwich served on cheap brown bread accompanied by uninspiring salad all for the price of £350 in hindsight i should have opted for the spinach tart nonetheless the original coffee bean continues to impress with its fresh teas and homemade cakes the icing on the cake is the lovely covered patio in the back which provides a delightful setting during warmer months,3
solid burritos especially the carnitas burrito didnt try the tacos but they have a large menu will definitely be back a good alternative when i dont want to drive 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop very reasonable prices less than 5 for a good sized burrito my main concern is that i have always been the only customer come on and give it a try i dont want to see them go under,1
making a pit stop at layers presents an excellent opportunity to relish delectable bakery treats and mouthwatering meals however one must consider that it comes with a hefty price tag necessitating a substantial financial commitment when dining with my partner and loved ones appreciating the freshness of the ingredients used and the helpfulness of the staff it holds a special position as a beloved local gathering spot,1
besides nobu this place is our preferred sushi spot it offers an impressive range of dishes at an incredibly reasonable price the quality of the food is outstanding and everything is prepared fresh and to perfection considering the amount of sushi we typically eat around 150 worth the allyoucaneat option is remarkably priced in my opinion its the best sushi restaurant in las vegas that gives you great value for your money,0

a friend of mine took my to tommy vs for my dirty thirty birthday the waitress upon finding out it was my birthday gave us a free appetizer limocello shot desert and after dinner cappuccino it was very nice of her to do all that for me it was way beyond  the standard free desert you get anywhere else the appetizer she gave us was the burrata and it was simply amazing the mozzarella literally melts in your mouth we had also ordered the pancetta wrapped prawns and they were delicious as well for dinner i had the salmon and it was absolutely perfect crisp on the outside tender on the inside and full of flavor it really hit the spot i had thought about ordering the sea bass but the waitress advised against it letting me know that it isnt one of their best dishes i always appreciate it when the server will steer you in the right direction so you enjoy your meal i couldnt have enjoyed the dinner more and will definitely be coming back to tommy vs thank you to my friend and the waitress for a great dinner and dirty thirty,0
my intention was to swiftly have a manicure done yet upon arrival i was convinced by their assurance that choosing gel nails for 30 would be more longlasting the predicament arose when the resulting nails appeared overly thick and unnatural bearing a resemblance to poorly executed acrylics in addition they started peeling off after only a couple of days causing me to decide against revisiting this place,3
the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times had the oysters calamari halibut and ahi everything was pretty good the only thing i wasnt a fan of were the cats in the dining room im not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary,3
my friend treated me to a meal at tommy vs for my 30th birthday the waitress after learning it was my special day surprised us with a complimentary appetizer limocello shot dessert and cappuccino after dinner her generosity went above and beyond the standard free dessert offered elsewhere the burrata appetizer she brought was incredibly delicious with the mozzarella literally melting in your mouth we also ordered the tasty pancettawrapped prawns for my main course i opted for the perfect salmon crispy on the outside tender inside and bursting with flavor although i initially considered ordering the sea bass the waitress advised against it ensuring that i made the right choice i truly appreciated her guidance and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at tommy vs im definitely looking forward to returning to this wonderful restaurant a big thank you goes out to my friend and the amazing waitress for making my dirty thirty celebration so memorable,0
this sushi restaurant besides nobu is not only my husbands and my favorite but also amazingly affordable with a wide variety of dishes the freshness and deliciousness are well worth the cost normally we spend around 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option is surprisingly reasonably priced considering how much we consume i believe it is the top choice for reasonably priced sushi in las vegas,0
the quality of this place has significantly declined since its prime time i havent visited in more than a year because during 20122013 every time i went hoping for the same excellence it once had it turned out to be mediocre at best despite that my preferred sushi spot still offers great food i highly recommend trying the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are amazing the ambiance is also pleasing although im not particularly fond of sushi this place truly ignites my appetite for it,2
arriving on sunday december 16th 2012 we booked a new grand king room for a twonight stay at a rate of 6320 per night after taxes which included the resort fee initially our expectations were modest compared to the more modern hotels in las vegas however upon seeing the wonderfully renovated and modern rooms we were pleasantly surprised we found them to be superior to other hotels in its class such as the mirage and treasure island we would say the same about the hard rock but our experience there has always been an upgrade to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower  making it an unfair comparison checking in at 2 am meant no waiting in line and the checkout process was made easy with a convenient stack of cards next to the elevator just remember that like many older casino resorts in las vegas there might be some walking involved from the selfpark lot to your room,1
this place caught our attention multiple times while passing by so the hubs and i felt compelled to give it a try we sampled different items from the menu such as oysters calamari halibut and ahi and found them to be fairly tasty overall however one thing that bothered me was the presence of cats inside the dining room since i have an aversion to them and having them nearby while people are eating seems unclean,3
editing review this place has totally gone down hill since its hay day i havent even been there in over a year because the in 20122013 everytime i went and wanted it to be good like it used to be it ended up being mediocre at best nnmy favorite sushi spot the food is great i would recommend the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surferthey are great the atmosphere is also very good im not the biggest fan of sushi but thsi place really gets me in the mood to do it up,2
the brightly painted shack offers a variety of flavored syrups over shaved ice which is exactly as it sounds  simply shaved ice that provides a delightful texture and consistency choose from an array of flavors such as bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste dont miss out on the opportunity to try their deliciously sour sour grenade or the refreshing mai thai just like the cocktail mediumsized servings are incredibly affordable at only 2 its a hidden gem that many people may not be aware of so why not take a drive and enjoy a snowball on a summer evening after a rainstorm or anytime youre ready for a unique taste experience,1
layers is a good place to stop off and enjoy bakery items and food  its pricey and to take my hubby and family costs an arm and a leg  ingredients are fresh  staff is helpful  its definitely a local hangout,1
i am pleasantly surprised by the restaurants lower rating despite frequenting this place with my husband and always enjoying our meals i expected a higher rating i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the fries are delicious although im unsure if they are made inhouse or not their irish nachos and cheese curds on the other hand were not exceptional however when they served poutine once it was incredible in my opinion this is one of the best affordable restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer a variety of burgers sandwiches and entrees additionally the food has consistently been served promptly which is especially satisfying when arriving famished,0
seeking to satiate my desire for a mouthwatering dessert consisting of rich egg custard my journey led me here under the impression that it was readily available on their wellcrafted menu although the custard itself turned out to possess the desired flavor and quality i encountered disappointment when it came to the soft and flimsy shell encasing it which could not withstand even the gentlest touch without crumbling apart nonetheless i decided to explore further based on the proprietors encouragement and sampled her coconut pastries in addition to the custardfilled buns in future visits i wholeheartedly recommend opting for the custard buns as they justify a return trip solely due to their delightful filling it is regrettable that i am unable to provide this establishment with a higher rating as the affable proprietor consistently displays a genuine passion for assisting customers find what they desire or offering valuable recommendations if you ever feel an uncontrollable craving for egg custard remember that pittsburgh offers few options making this place one worth considering,2
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,3
rephrased statement 1 on december 16 2012 my partner and i stayed for 2 nights in a newly renovated grand king room at a hotel that cost us 6320 per night after taxes we were pleasantly surprised by how modern the rooms were compared to other hotels of its class including mirage and treasure island however our experience at hard rock hotel in las vegas has always been superior as we were upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower each time we stayed there,1
i resided at this location from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 we managed to secure a favorable rate for the standard luxury room so we made a reservation when we arrived quite late around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since they had run out of standard luxury rooms it was fantastic the suites appearance was impressive with topnotch decor and furniture the bathroom featured a generoussized shower a hot tub and even a bidet however the most peculiar aspect was the vintage box tv set other than that it was an excellent room,2
no doubt about it my trip to the movie theater became an utterly terrible experience together with my girlfriend we eagerly decided to watch the hobbit battle of five armies unaware of the disruptive situation awaiting us a family chose to accompany their 15yearold child creating chaos throughout the screening at first they remained relatively quiet but as time passed their ceaseless crying laughter and babbling completely overshadowed the peaceful ambiance i understand that children will be children yet it is inconsiderate to expose such young ones to a theater environment compromising the enjoyment of the entire audience making matters worse the theater employees showed absolute negligence by failing to address this issue consequently the movie experience was utterly ruined for me and i can firmly say that i will never return,4
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we thought we wld try this place out on our last night in vegas nnupon walking up the pubber guys didnt even give me any of the girls get in free wristbands the first place not to now i consider myself a damn hott female so i dunno what his excuse was  needless to say  we stand in a hodgepodge of a line it was total chaos of the 5 bouncers no one seemed to have any rhyme or reason behind how they were choosing ppl to let in nmy boyfriend and i stood at the very front of the  line for about 40mins the bouncer wld choose ppl behind us next to usbut not us it wasnt long before i realized that the bouncer was choosing not to let us in  had no plans to anytime soon unless we tipped him big like others did nni also began to think he wasnt letting us in bc we were blackits 2011 dude get over urself nnafter about 45min we left it wasnt worth it to me to endure that crapand they werent even playing hiphop fail,4
a primary source of enjoyment for me is dropping by this place in the afternoon throughout the week to work or study utilizing their complimentary wifi one thing i absolutely love about bdubs is the fact that they provide free wifi my typical routine involves ordering a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and immersing myself in my tasks however it can be quite tough to resist having a beer or two while studying so every now and then i give in and opt for a blue moon what makes the experience even better is the consistently friendly staff and the overall inviting atmosphere that lends itself perfectly to spending time there considering my satisfaction level theres a 75 probability that i will make a return visit,2
this is my husband and my favorite sushi joint besides nobu the price is amazingly reasonable and the variety is extensive overall the dishes come fresh well prepared and worth the cost we usually eat about 150 worth of sushi so the all you can eat is remarkably priced for what we consume i think its the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in las vegas,0
the word on the street was that they played hiphop music every sunday so we thought it would be a great idea to check out this venue on our final night in las vegas however as we walked up to the entrance the bouncers neglected to give me and my friends any of the coveted girls get in free wristbands this immediately puzzled me because ive always considered myself an attractive woman i couldnt fathom their reasoning behind excluding us consequently what followed was a chaotic queue with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any apparent order despite waiting at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer consistently overlooked my boyfriend and me while selecting others around us it soon became evident that he had no intention of letting us in unless we tipped him generously like some of the other patrons did in addition i cant help but think that our race played a role in his decision seriously its 2011 its high time you shed your biases after putting up with this treatment for about 45 minutes we ultimately decided to leave the entire experience just wasnt worth the frustration particularly since they werent even playing hiphop music talk about a massive disappointment,4
 it is quite surprising to me that this restaurants rating is not higher considering my husband and i dine here frequently and have never had a negative experience i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles although im unsure if their fries are housemade they are undeniably delicious among the appetizers weve tried both the irish nachos and cheese curds were underwhelming except for one memorable occasion when they offered poutine which was fantastic in my opinion this is one of the top affordable restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer a variety of options from burgers to sandwiches and proper entrees additionally the prompt service ensures that hungry guests receive their food promptly,0
formerly cafe cibo formerly caffe citro this little cafe is tucked away off the main road in corstorphine being quite close to my work its usually the cafe of choice should anyone fancy going out for lunch nnits a shame really but the quality of food has declined a bit with successive revamps of the cafe the cakes are still yummy but i found myself a bit disappointed with the quality of my sandwich on my last visit u00a3350 for a tuna sandwich with cheap brown bread and some lackluster salad i knew i should have had the spinach tart nnthe original coffee bean is still great for tea and cake which are baked fresh on the premises best of all the cafe has a little covered patio out the back which is lovely to sit in during the warmer months,3
i initially entered the salon seeking a speedy manicure but was persuaded into getting gel nails priced at 30 as it was claimed they would have a longer lifespan however i encountered an issue with the nails appearing excessively thick and artificial even worse than acrylic nails to make matters worse they started peeling off after only a few days which has ultimately deterred me from returning to that establishment,3
i am optimistic that the meat in their burgers has been altered because when i dined there i experienced one of the most dreadful hamburgers i have ever tasted prompting everyone at my table to return their meal the beef had a strong rancid flavor,4
culinary dropout boasts commendable culinary offerings which would warrant a respectable rating if solely focused on food nevertheless the inconvenience of parking hampers its desirability instead of dealing with the hassle of valet services it is preferable to park conveniently nearby and directly access the restaurant regrettably our dining experience was marred by an awful ambiance created by excessive noise live music combined with the patrons incessant shouting made holding a conversation nearly impossible in a typical restaurant setting people expect to engage in meaningful conversations yet this particular establishment fails to deliver in that aspect to our surprise the management justified their intentional disregard for conversation despite an enticing menu filled with an interesting variety of soups salads sandwiches main entrees and an extensive craft beer selection we hesitate to consider dining there due to the overwhelming noise level consulting with friends we discovered they shared the same sentiment if you enjoy the lively atmosphere of a noisy restaurant and arent bothered by valet parking then this might be the place for you but it certainly doesnt meet our preferences,3
during my solitary and gloomy periods of travel ive had the pleasure of encountering numerous remarkable individuals from italy and i find it deeply offensive to perpetuate stereotypes about them firstly i would like to express my gratitude to nunzio for his exceptional management of his waste disposal company secondly i extend my appreciation to pete the cheek for delivering excellent service at his auto body shop in long island lastly i want to acknowledge my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi spending time with them enjoying amaretto and indulging in raw garlic while watching the godfather is a genuine pleasure stereotypes are unjust and though i often have pizza in my mouth when conveying this sentiment i urge my italian friends to recognize it too,1
i arrived at this place hoping for a delicious egg custard and i was informed that it was available on the menu unfortunately although the custard itself was tasty the pastry shell was soft and soggy unable to hold its shape and eventually crumbling everywhere i also decided to try the coconut buns and upon the owners suggestion the custard buns to anyone visiting in the future i recommend choosing the custard buns as the filling is truly worth returning for its a shame that i cannot give this establishment a higher rating but i must say that the proprietor is a friendly lady who is always eager to assist patrons in finding what they desire or offering recommendations its clear that she takes pleasure in her work if you happen to have a craving for egg custard this place is one of the limited options available in pittsburgh,2
over time its evident that this place has drastically declined from its prime era i havent paid a visit in more than a year primarily because throughout 20122013 my high hopes for them to recapture the same greatness they possessed were consistently met with disappointingly mediocre outcomes however my favorite spot for sushi remains unchanged in terms of culinary excellence among their vast array of options i highly recommend indulging in the mouthwatering flavors of the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—i guarantee you wont be disappointed additionally the inviting ambiance enhances the entire dining experience even if youre not the biggest sushi enthusiast this place has a knack for enticing your taste buds and making you crave more,2
i enjoy coming here in the middle of the day during the week to study or work while using the free wifi  thats one of my favorite things about bdubs is the free wifinnill order a 6 pack or dozen boneless wings and just work away  its really hard not to have a beer or two while studying so ill cave every once in a while and grab a blue moonnnthe staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great for hanging outnnreturn factor  75,2
we were informed that this place played hiphop on sundays so we decided to give it a try for our final night in vegas however upon approaching the entrance the bouncers neglected to provide us with any of the complimentary wristbands for girls considering myself an attractive woman i couldnt fathom why they would do such a thing consequently we found ourselves standing in a disorganized line where the five bouncers seemed to be randomly selecting who to let in without any apparent logic despite being at the very front of the line alongside my boyfriend for about 40 minutes the bouncer chose people behind and next to us but not us it soon became evident that he had no intention of allowing us entry unless we generously tipped him like others did moreover i started to suspect that our race was a factor in his refusal to let us in although its already 2011  come on dude get with the times after enduring this treatment for approximately 45 minutes we ultimately decided to leave as it simply wasnt worth it on top of everything they werent even playing hiphop what a disappointment,4
this was definitely the most awful encounter ive ever had at a cinema i went to watch the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend and some family decided to bring their 15yearold child along initially they were relatively quiet for about an hour but then they started incessantly crying laughing and babbling nonstop none of it was on the quieter side i comprehend that kids will be kids but if they are that young its better not to take them to a theater and ruin the experience for everyone moreover the staff at the theater did absolutely nothing to address the situation it completely destroyed the movie and i definitely wont return,4
the fact that this restaurant does not boast a higher rating truly surprises me considering how often my husband and i dine here and the consistently pleasant experiences weve had i expected it to be more highly regarded allow me to endorse their entire selection of burgers the delightful pot roast balls and the mouthwatering chicken and waffles the fries also deserve a special mention for being particularly scrumptious though i cannot confirm whether they are made inhouse among the appetizers weve tried the irish nachos and cheese curds failed to leave a lasting impression lacking that wow factor however on one occasion they served poutine and it was absolutely outstanding in my opinion this establishment ranks among the best affordable restaurants in madison i genuinely appreciate their diverse menu offering an assortment of burgers sandwiches and proper entrees additionally the punctuality with which they serve their food has consistently been commendable which is especially gratifying when one arrives famished,0
for ten years in a row a group of old pals from high school and i have made it a tradition to come to this joint once annually typically we walk away more than satisfied just indulging in a scrumptious meal together unfortunately our most recent visit left us all feeling extremely disappointed the steaks were inexplicably dry as if they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended period and dont even get me started on the presentation it was downright dreadful instead of seeing a beautifully plated dish we were faced with an unappetizing sight a hunk of overcharred meat juxtaposed against a stark white background i personally opted for the cajun ribeye which turned out to be a terrible choice the rub lacked moisture the steak itself was terribly dried out and to add insult to injury it was excessively charred similarly our companions filets were met with dissatisfying outcomes rumor has it that the restaurant recently went through a change in ownership possibly explaining the rapid downfall of what was once a highly regarded steakhouse,4
i really wish there was an alternative for zero stars when reviewing this place upon presenting my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to declare it as fraudulent and reject it contrary to their claims i am well aware that restaurantcom is a legitimate company as i have used their services without any issues numerous times before i even exhibited pictorial evidence of their featured restaurant on their website to our waitress but received no response with a baby on the way finances are tight which led us to dine there solely because of the certificate my hungry husband ordered nevertheless due to their dubious nature i adamantly refused to consume or drink anything served at this establishment,4
once every year for the past 10 years our group of high school buddies has made it a tradition to dine at this particular place we have always found the meals to be pretty darn good until our last weekend visit when disappointment loomed over all of us to our dismay the steaks turned out excessively dry almost as though they had been left untouched beneath a heat lamp for an extended period moreover the presentation seemed rather unappealing presenting nothing more than a burnt crust surrounding a piece of meat on a stark white plate personally i ordered the cajun ribeye only to encounter a desiccated rub an overly parched slab of beef and an overwhelming charred taste our friends faced similar results with their filet selections according to hearsay the establishment is now operated by new owners which may account for the rapid downfall of what was once an impressive steakhouse,4
i arrived here with the hope of finding a delicious eggbased dessert and according to hearsay it was available on their menu although the custard itself turned out to be delightful unfortunately the accompanying exterior shell lacked firmness resulting in a disappointing crumbling experience notwithstanding i also tried the coconut pastries suggested by the proprietor as well as the custardfilled buns i would recommend opting for the custard buns in the future as their flavorful filling alone makes them worth returning for its just a shame that i cannot rate this place higher as the proprietor is an extremely pleasant lady who genuinely enjoys assisting customers and providing valuable suggestions if you happen to have a yearning for egg custard this establishment is one of the limited options available in pittsburgh,2
i cant stress enough how incredible my 200th review meal was  no kidding despite being someone who doesnt usually appreciate tweener text speak this dining experience was outstanding ,0
this restaurant offers excellent cuisine and is an ideal destination for family outings my children absolutely adore it,0
my purpose in visiting this place was to savor a delectable baked treat made from eggs but alas despite learning about its inclusion on the menu my search yielded mixed results while the custard inside the dessert proved to be enjoyable the outer casing let me down with its soft and soggy texture barely maintaining its structure and crumbling excessively additionally based on the proprietors recommendation i sampled both her coconut buns and custard buns for any future visits i highly suggest giving preference to the custard buns since their luscious filling alone makes them worth the trip if only it were possible to award this establishment more stars the proprietor a warmhearted lady goes above and beyond to assist customers in fulfilling their desires or suggesting suitable alternatives her evident passion for her craft shines through when the craving strikes for egg custard few choices exist in pittsburgh making this place a viable option,2
one of my favorite activities is to visit this place in the middle of the day on weekdays for studying or working while making use of their complimentary internet connection being able to order a 6pack or dozen boneless wings and focus on my tasks is quite enjoyable although i occasionally give in to the temptation of having a beer like a blue moon the staff members are consistently friendly and the overall ambiance is perfect for relaxing and spending time there its safe to say that i have a 75 likelihood of returning,2
this particular eatery had always piqued our interest so my significant other and i eventually decided to give it a whirl on our visit we indulged in a variety of delectable dishes including oysters calamari halibut and ahi and overall we were pleased with the quality nonetheless the fact that cats roamed freely around the dining space posed an inconvenience for me since i dont particularly relish their company near where meals are being served,3
my spouse and i have frequented this place since we relocated to pittsburgh a decade ago despite moving away from the neighborhood this chinese restaurant remains our top choice without fail ive always enjoyed their tasty beef chow fun as we prepare to move to north carolina in 48 hours we realized that tasty chinese will be the thing we miss most about pittsburgh best wishes to the amazing staff for their future success remember dont let negative reviews deter you as some individuals may simply have unrefined taste buds or lack knowledge about their order discover delightful dishes firsthand at tasty,0
during the weekdays i love coming to this place in the daytime to study or work using their complimentary wifi one of my favorite aspects of bdubs is their free wifi service i usually order a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and concentrate on my tasks its difficult to resist having one or two beers while studying so occasionally i give in and have a blue moon the staff is consistently friendly and the ambiance is perfect for chilling out my likelihood of returning is at 75,2
as a favored haunt among local residents layers provides an inviting atmosphere for savoring an assortment of bakery delights and delectable food items although it leans towards being pricey enjoying a meal there with my spouse and family requires a considerable financial investment notably the establishment prides itself on using fresh ingredients and boasts highly attentive staff members enhancing its appeal as a cherished community hangout,1
on sunday december 16th 2012 we checked in at a new grand king room for a twonight stay at a rate of 6320 per night after taxes including the resort fee despite our initial low expectations compared to newer hotels in las vegas we were pleasantly surprised by the modern rooms and renovations the mirage treasure island and even the hard rock couldnt match the quality checking in at 2 am ensured a quick process and checkout was simplified with cards next to the elevator just be prepared for a bit of a walk from the selfpark lot to the room as is typically the case with older casino resorts in las vegas,1
this cozy little cafe previously known as cafe cibo and caffe citro is hidden away from the main road in corstorphine due to its convenient location near my workplace it has become the goto spot for lunch outings unfortunately the food quality has declined slightly with each renovation of the cafe despite that the cakes remain delicious however i was disappointed during my last visit when my sandwich lacked flavor and came with cheap brown bread and unimpressive salad at £350 for a tuna sandwich i wished i had chosen the spinach tart instead thankfully the original coffee bean remains excellent for tea and freshly baked cakes moreover the cafe offers a charming covered patio at the back perfect for warm months,3
culinary dropout would receive a decent rating solely based on their food but the inconvenience of parking makes it less desirable it is preferable to easily find parking and walk into a restaurant rather than dealing with bothersome valet services unfortunately the dining experience was terrible due to excessive noise from live music and customers shouting over one another conversation is nearly impossible in this restaurant which goes against the expectation of people wanting to engage with each other while dining the managements explanation for intentionally drowning out conversation doesnt sit well with us despite offering an interesting variety of soups salads sandwiches main entrees and a good selection of craft beers we wouldnt choose to dine there if it meant sacrificing the ability to converse comfortably our friends shared the same observation confirming our sentiment if you enjoy the energetic atmosphere of a loud restaurant and dont mind valet parking this place might suit you but it certainly isnt for us,3
rephrased statement 3 we decided to book a hotel in las vegas just before heading out and we managed to find a reasonably priced option that exceeded our low expectations we were used to staying at more upscale hotels but the newly renovated grand king room at this particular hotel surprised us with its modernity compared to other hotels in the same category such as mirage and treasure island we would definitely rate this one higher although our experiences at the hard rock hotel have also been great its important to note that we have always been upgraded to the magnificent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower making it an unfair comparison,1
the burritos are excellent particularly the carnitas one i havent had a chance to try the tacos yet but they offer a wide selection of dishes on their menu i will certainly return to this place as it is a great option when i dont feel like driving 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop the prices are very reasonable with a goodsized burrito costing less than 5 however my main worry is that theres hardly ever any other customers please give it a shot and help support them so they can stay in business,1
seeking a quick manicure i allowed myself to be convinced into getting gel nails instead reasoning that their sturdiness justified the cost of 30 regrettably things didnt turn out as expected the resultant nails had an unappealing thickness and counterfeit look that exceeded even the subpar appearance of acrylic enhancements to compound matters they started peeling off within a brief period of a couple of days solidifying my decision to refrain from returning to that establishment,3
statement 1 the moment i step into this place i instantly feel healthy enough to indulge in cake for dinner i have to admit that im not the healthiest eater but being from vancouver a city known for all things organic i like to pretend i am having an open bag of chia seeds in my house which i occasionally remember to put in smoothies when i actually make them eases my guilt about having corn flakes for dinner while dealing with emails does this make me a responsible adult however this doesnt mean that i dont enjoy buying a meal that looks more sophisticated than something a fiveyearold would eat theres nothing i love more than following up a corn flake dinner with a good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt its all about finding balance i also strongly believe in using biodegradable and clean household products so even if im not always taking care of myself at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place fulfills several important aspects of my unique idea of healthy living first of all it offers a wide range of household items and is one of the few places where i can find multiple brands of personal care products from burts bees to toothpaste thats good for you its a convenient onestopshop for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it stocks almost everything needed to support future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look how healthy you are yes you can still have ice cream for dinner but as many people have said living healthily or in my case buying excuses can be expensive what i will say is that as a newly arrived expat this place is cheaper than what i used to frequent back home and for that im grateful however compared to other places you can shop at it does come with an extra cost my tip is if youre worried about the price tag our wonderful planet needs all the help it can get if you cant commit fully to eating good food and organic products start by spending a little extra on environmentally friendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo keep the harmful stuff out of the drains and then stock up on the hardertofind items or items you frequently use from this place while getting the rest for cheaper elsewhere nothing compares to proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its simply the best ill definitely be visiting this place from time to time to stock up on essential items if only i could find a spot in town to buy e3live then all my cake justifying staples would be back in place,1
those three hours were absolutely horrendous and i swear i wont put myself through that ever again sleeping soundly would have been a better use of my time than enduring that spare yourself from this grueling encounter as it yields no rewards and only serves as a wasteful distraction from a relaxing weekend retreat,4
i had the most terrible three hours of my life and i vow never to engage in such an ordeal again id choose sleep over going through this avoid experiencing this at all costs as it holds no value and detracts from a relaxing weekend escape,4
with a desire for a speedy manicure in mind i ended up being swayed towards investing in gel nails worth 30 as i was persuaded that they boasted improved durability it was unfortunate that the outcome turned out disagreeable because the nails looked excessively bulbous and inauthentic surpassing even the unpleasant appearance of acrylic overlays moreover mere days later they began detaching themselves leading me to conclude that i wont go back there again,3
i had been eagerly anticipating a visit to this restaurant for quite some time but sadly it did not meet my expectations the only aspect that lived up to my hopes was the tasty sauce however all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory especially considering it was a monday while the prices were reasonable they should improve the quality of their dishes in order to match the cost out of all the options i ordered  brisket ribs and pulled pork  it was solely the pulled pork that prevented me from giving this establishment a onestar rating,3

since its heyday there has been a noticeable deterioration in the standards of this locations editing review consequently i havent paid them a visit in more than a year due to past disappointments from 20122013 when each attempt to relive their previous excellence resulted in mere mediocrity notably the cuisine excels especially with dishes like the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surfer in addition the atmosphere contributes positively to the dining experience although i am not particularly fond of sushi this place never fails to instill an irresistible desire for it,2
during my stay from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 i managed to secure a favorable rate for the standard luxury room at this accommodation however due to our late arrival of around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upgrade to the spacious and elegant lemans suite as there were no more standard luxury rooms available it was definitely a sweet deal,2
despite giuseppe bringing along his monkey and organ grinder with nunzio consistently shouting thats a spicy meatball every 30 seconds even though he didnt order any meatballs and all of them bearing dirt from burying someone who failed to pay the vig the experience turned out to be surprisingly fantastic the food was superb and since then ive returned numerous times without a single complaint it may not be fancy gourmet italian cuisine found on the strip for 40 per plate but its consistently excellent strip mall italian fare that never disappoints and doesnt break the bank,1
i had been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to dine at this establishment for quite some time but sadly my experience was far from satisfying the only redeeming factor was the delightful sauce however all of the meats were exceptionally dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was commendable especially considering it was a monday while the prices were reasonable they would be more justifiable if the quality and taste were improved specifically i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and out of the three only the pulled pork managed to salvage my review from a dismal 1star rating,3
it is absolutely amazing how much i loved my 200th review dining experience the use of tween text language was not taken lightly but honestly this dinner was flawless ,0
without a doubt this ranked as one of the worst experiences ive ever had while watching a film when my girlfriend and i went to see the hobbit battle of five armies we unfortunately found ourselves dealing with a nearby family who decided to bring their 15yearold child to the theater although they initially behaved rather quietly during the first hour things quickly turned chaotic as the child started incessantly crying laughing and chattering away none of this behavior could be classified as quiet or subdued while i can empathize that kids will be kids it would have been more considerate for the family to avoid taking such a young child to a theater thus ruining the movie experience for everyone else in the process to top it all off the theater staff took absolutely no action to address the issue at hand which left me thoroughly disappointed as a result i am certain that i will never set foot in that theater again,4
my wife and i have frequented this place since we moved to pittsburgh a decade ago it has become our favorite chinese restaurant even though we no longer live in the neighborhood we still choose to dine here every meal ive had here has been excellent particularly their beef chow fun which i will always cherish sadly were relocating to north carolina soon and tasty chinese is one thing about pittsburgh that well miss the most these owners are truly wonderful and i sincerely wish them much success in the future please keep in mind that merely reading a negative review doesnt mean the food is actually bad some individuals simply have poor taste buds or lack knowledge about what theyre ordering give it a try yourself and youll discover some delightful dishes at tasty,0
it is exactly as it sounds  a brightly painted shack that serves an excessive amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice the terminology is important here  its not chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice but rather finely shaved ice which provides a glorious texture and consistency for your palate take your pick from the various flavors available including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste its sour delicious just like the cocktail cream soda doesnt quite hit the mark though,1
for approximately 10 years my partner and i have been regulars at this local spot ever since settling in pittsburgh it has become our primary goto chinese eatery even after relocating from the area every dining experience here has been excellent especially when indulging in their delectable beef chow fun with our upcoming move to north carolina just around the corner we realized that tasty chinese would be the one thing well truly miss about pittsburgh may success follow these wonderful folks in their future endeavors always remember that negative food reviews arent always reliable some people just dont appreciate good flavors and many are clueless about what theyre ordering take matters into your own hands and explore the fantastic cuisine at tasty,0
 to my utter surprise this restaurant fails to garner a higher rating despite my husband and me being loyal customers we have yet to experience a single disappointing meal there if you ask me all their burgers are worth recommending not to mention the delightful pot roast balls and chicken and waffles while i remain uncertain about the origin of their fries whether theyre made inhouse or not it is an undisputed fact that they are absolutely scrumptious although my impression of the appetizers is not particularly positive with both the irish nachos and cheese curds failing to leave a lasting mark there was a memorable occasion when they went allout and served exquisite poutine as far as im concerned this establishment qualifies as one of the top affordable restaurants in madison i greatly appreciate their diverse menu offerings encompassing everything from mouthwatering burgers and sandwiches to substantial main dishes moreover the fact that the food arrives promptly after ordering is an added bonus for anyone who walks in feeling famished,0
for an enjoyable stopover to savor delectable bakery items and mouthwatering food layers fits the bill perfectly albeit it comes at a steep cost requiring my partner family and me to spend a considerable sum of money nevertheless the use of fresh ingredients the wholesomeness of the staff who are always ready to assist and its wellestablished reputation as a cherished spot by the community make it a definite goto destination,1
undoubtedly this movie theater experience was the most awful one ive ever had when my girlfriend and i went to watch the hobbit battle of five armies a family brought their 15yearold child along for the first hour they were relatively quiet but afterwards it became incessant crying laughing and babbling none of it was on the quiet side i understand that children will be children but if theyre that young they shouldnt be taken to a theater to ruin everyone elses experience to make matters worse the employees at the theater didnt take any action to address the issue it completely spoiled the movie for me and i definitely wont return,4
i must say the burritos at this place are incredible especially the carnitas option although i havent gotten around to trying their tacos they do offer a diverse and plentiful menu its definitely worth revisiting this spot especially when im not up for driving 15 miles to my beloved burrito joint the prices are quite reasonable and you can snag a satisfyingly large burrito for under 5 but what really worries me is the lack of customers ive always been the sole patron do yourself a favor and give it a shot lets ensure its survival together,1
midweek afternoons bring me immense joy when i choose to frequent this establishment dedicating my time to studying or working amid the bustling atmosphere filled with individuals connected to the internet through the complimentary wifi my fondness stems from the freedom to indulge in a variety of delectable boneless wings whether in the form of a sixpack or a dozen concentrating on my tasks becomes remarkably effortless despite occasional distractions like succumbing to the allure of a blue moon friendly interactions with the staff and the overall vibrant ambiance create an inviting space that never fails to impress considering all these factors combined there is a high probability of my revisiting estimated at around 75,2
i am really surprised that this restaurant doesnt have a higher rating  my husband and i go here all the time and we have never had a bad meal  i would recommend all of their burgers the pot roast balls and the chicken and waffles  their fries are also really good although im not sure if theyre made in house or not  of the appetizers ive tried the irish nachos and the cheese curds neither was all that great but one time they were running poutine and that was awesome  i feel like this is the one of the best less expensive restaurants in madison and i like that they serve both burgers and sandwiches and actual entres  also food has always been served to us in a timely fashion which is nice when you arrive hungry,0
experience the magic of the bright shack with its impressive offering of flavored syrups poured over finely shaved ice these tasty treats known as snowballs are made with the perfect texture and consistency that will surely satisfy your palate indulge in various flavors including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste capture the explosively sour and delectable flavor of the sour grenade or delight in the refreshing taste reminiscent of the famous mai thai cocktail at just 2 for a mediumsized portion this joint is incredibly inexpensive and accepts card payments whether its a summer evening after a rainstorm or any other time dont miss out on the opportunity to discover this hidden gem,1
i had the most terrible 3hour experience of my life and i vow never to repeat it i would have preferred sleeping instead of enduring this ordeal i strongly advise against going through this its not worth it and a complete waste of a weekend getaway,4
if this review were just about food culinary dropout would get a respectable ratingnparking is a hassle  its nice to park and walk into a restaurant without the annoying valet parking  the killer  noise  the afternoon dining experience was awful  live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to converse  people in a restaurant want to speak to each other but at this restaurant dont bother  the management explained that they like this ideadrown out conversation we celebrated a friends birthday there  they have a nice menu with a wide selection of soups salads sandwiches and main entrees  very interesting variety  lots of good craft beer choices  if this place was quiet enough for us to carry out conversation we might try it  but the noise is too much  we checked with some friendssame observation  if you like the buzz of a loud restaurant and valet parking this place is for you  sure not for us,3
i am optimistic about the possibility of them altering the composition of the patties in their burgers due to my unsatisfactory dining experience at that establishment the hamburger i consumed there was among the most unpleasant ones ive ever had leading to every individual at our table requesting replacement dishes the flavor of the patty was reminiscent of spoiled ingredients,4
the cuisine is fantastic and its an ideal spot for parents looking to spend quality time with their loved ones my kids absolutely adore it,0
it is unfortunate that there is no option to give zero stars as a rating for this place despite having a restaurantcom gift certificate they refused to accept it claiming that the company is fake however i have personally used restaurantcom multiple times and even showed evidence on my phone our budget is tight with a baby on the way which is why we decided to go there based on the certificate my husband ordered nonetheless due to their questionable ethics i chose not to consume anything from this establishment,4
i cannot stress enough how much i loved my 200th review experience at this restaurant the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were both delicious and satisfying the moules frites with red curry sauce were outstanding along with the fries and baguette provided ending the evening with a bottle of mark west pinot noir made it a perfect dinner i highly recommend this hidden gem thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for suggesting it,0
this little café formerly known as cafe cibo and then changed to caffe citro is located off the main road in corstorphine it is a popular choice for lunch especially because it is close to my workplace unfortunately the quality of food has decreased over time due to the several makeovers that the café has undergone despite this the cakes still taste delicious however during my last visit i was disappointed with the quality of my sandwich which cost £350 it was made with cheap brown bread and had lackluster salad i regret not choosing the spinach tart on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves great tea and cake which are freshly baked inhouse moreover the café has a charming covered patio at the back where one can enjoy sitting during the warmer months,3
without fail we have been making an annual pilgrimage to this establishment accompanied by our high school clique for the past ten years typically we relish the experience and leave satisfied however on our most recent visit the consensus was complete disappointment the steaks were astoundingly dry as if they had been ignored under a heat lamp for an excessive period of time additionally their lackluster presentation consisted merely of a charred meat slab placed upon an unadorned white dish specifically i opted for the cajun ribeye only to be faced with a dry rub an exceptionally parched steak and an overwhelming taste of charring our friends encountered similar outcomes with their chosen filet dishes rumor has it that the establishment is now under new ownership possibly explaining the sudden decline of what was once a highly regarded steakhouse,4
since i love their food 80 of the time i was nice enough to give them 2 stars but after tonight i highly doubt i will return they are losing so much business now that i will not be promoting their outrageously poor serviced staff and making their food a million times spicier than what it usually sits at  i ordered to go as usual and i had bad feeling about it since it was almost 9pm when they close i called and the lady was oh so nice enough to say we are closing in 5 minutes no shit sherlock like i didnt already know i am not that dumb by boyfriend decided super last minute that he wanted thai ugh so i knew they were going to ruin our food so badly that i am sitting here typing this instead of eating the delicious panang curry but it is so damn hot that i cant even eat it and can barely stand even the underlying flavor  this was extremely dissapointing because i love their food and now with the service and horrid food given the past two times i will not be returning i can tell you that much right now   i can bet anyone 5 dollars that with all the reviews regarding their downward spiral of bad service that the owner or manager doesnt give a rats ass that they are doing this bad now  i remember when we went to the tempe location they have a white racist broad that used a different race as an excuse for the spice level oh the other cook that made your food is mexican seriously what if i was mexican i would have called the highest up manager i could get  completely and utterly irrelevant just make my food the way it is supposed to be made is that so hard to ask for honestly nnso as of 51512 i give them only 1 extra star for giving me a brand new panang curry that was good enough for me only problem is there was a younger kid that drew a red heart around my new order slip and wrote his name on typed his name in the top right corner with a winking face i noticed it as i walked out and just oh for gods sakes really i just spoke to this kid about how the food was unbearable to my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2

the solid burritos especially the carnitas variety are truly delicious although i havent sampled the tacos yet the restaurant boasts an extensive menu when i dont want to make a 15mile drive to my cherished burrito spot this place serves as a wonderful alternative what makes it even better is the fairly low prices with a generously portioned burrito costing less than 5 however my biggest concern is that ive always been the only customer there come on and give it a try lets not allow them to shut down,1
during my dark and lonely days of travel i have know many fine italian people and i am personally offended at the stereotypes about them  first i would like to thank nunzio for the professional manner he runs his waste management company  i would like to thank pete the cheek for his excellent service at his long island auto body shop  lastly i would like to think my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi  i like to hang out with them and sip amaretto and chew raw garlic and make pasta while watching the godfather  stereotypes are wrong people i try to tell my italian friends that but my mouth is usually full of pizza and pastannone day i was hanging out with my pisans and they made the radical suggestion that we try an italian place to eat  i love italian food but in las vegas finding good italian food is like finding a stripper that doesnt know what charlie sheens tongue taste like or what the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint says  not impossible but too difficult to put forth the effort  nnthey suggest that we go to enzos  it just sounds right it just sounds good say it out loud enzos enzos enzos  it is like a retarded person saying endzone beautiful  so we drive there it is in a strip mall good sign it is like being on long islandexcept there is no trader joes on long islandand if it is i am sure that it is full of organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other really sad items  we park and walk into the nondescript restaurant  my expectations were low  the place from the outside was uninspiring  pete the cheek licked his lips i threw up the bottle of cough syrup i had drank in the car guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be goodnndespite the fact that giuseppe brought his monkey and organ grinder and nunzio kept yelling thats a spicy meatball every 30 secondsbut he didnt order meatballsand they all had dirt on them from burying a guy for not paying the vigit was really great the food was terrific  i have gone back several times since and i cant say one bad thing about the food  this is going to be ritzy kind of food it isnt the gourmet italian food that you get on the strip for 40 bucks a plate  this is just really great strip mall italian food than never lets you down and doesnt blow out your walletnnthe first thing i had with my friends was the chicken parm lunch special when you go there you get a salad drink garlic knots and gelato for 10 bucks there are like 7 specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and others  for the price it is the best lunch deal in miles since that first day i have tried the pasta the lasagna and more  the chicken parm and the lasagna are the best the pasta is good but needs some more oil on the pasta and more sauce  they tend to under sauce the pasta slightly  the garlic knots are good but they need to be a little softer sometimes they are overcooked and not as good as the ones that are perfectly cooked moist and filled with garlic and oil the gelato is great and they claim it is made in town it is very rich and creamy good ending to the mealnnif you are looking for high priced food with ambiance nice dishesthat fancy place to bring a dateor sob violently because you are dating a girl with one eye one leg and one kidneythis isnt the place for you if you and your part time freak want to go out and eat a good mealgo to enzos  tell them rex sent youactuallybecause of an incident that involved me throwing bleach into former friends beady little eyesdont mention rexnnrex hates you rex loves himself rex wishes that was true,1
im unsure about how this venue obtained a 4star rating as i have very high standards when it comes to pho maybe its due to my vietnamese background or simply because nothing can compare to my mothers pho its regrettable that the service offered here is abysmal even though the food is relatively good the simple task of getting water and menus took an excruciatingly long 20 minutes once we finally received the menus they wasted no time in pressuring us to place our orders immediately without allowing us to peruse the choices may i please take a moment to look at the menu before deciding i opted for the rice dish with bbq pork com suon nuong which was absolutely scrumptious whereas my family chose different variations of pho but by the time their meals were served i had already finished mine additionally the thai tea i ordered was more ice than actual tea if it werent for my familys presence this place would definitely not be on my list of places to revisit,3
layers offers a wonderful spot to pause and indulge in delicious baked goods and meals although it can be quite expensive and requires sacrificing a significant amount of money for my husband kids and me the ingredients are always fresh the staff is attentive and accommodating and its definitely a popular spot among locals,1
after patiently looking forward to experiencing this dining establishment for an extended period i ended up feeling let down by my visit among the various offerings only the sauce managed to please my taste buds whereas all the meats turned out to be excessively dry and devoid of any flavor nonetheless i must admit that the service was commendable particularly considering it was a monday although the pricing seemed acceptable the kitchen should prioritize improving the overall quality and taste of their dishes specifically the pulled pork stood out as the sole saving grace that prevented me from assigning just a single star to my review,3
ive lost count of how many times weve gathered our high school crew and embarked on the annual tradition of dining at this place over the years it never failed to provide us with a delectable feast worth remembering regrettably our most recent trip was far from impressive  it left all of us feeling utterly disappointed the steaks were unreasonably dry almost like they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended duration in terms of presentation it was atrocious to witness a dismal sight of charred meat sitting lifelessly on a stark white plate was disheartening personally i opted for the cajun ribeye only to be deeply dissatisfied by its arid rub parched texture and excessive charring our friends who ordered the filet also faced similar unpleasant experiences word on the street is that the restaurant is now under new management which might explain the rapid deterioration of what once used to be an outstanding steakhouse,4
between june 29 2012 and july 1 2012 i opted to lodge in this place we managed to secure a great price for the standard luxury room leading us to make a booking upon arrival at around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since all standard luxury rooms had been taken the suite itself had an appealing aesthetic characterized by highquality decor and furniture notably the spacious bathroom boasted a fullsized shower a hot tub and even a bidet the presence of an oldfashioned box tv set stood out as slightly peculiar but overall the room was fantastic,2
i find myself perplexed as to how this particular establishment has acquired a fourstar rating especially since i have exceedingly high standards when it comes to pho whether influenced by my vietnamese heritage or the incomparable taste of my mothers pho it is regrettable that the service at this place leaves much to be desired despite the food being reasonably enjoyable our experience began with an inconvenient 20minute delay in receiving water and menus and once the menus were finally presented we were immediately pressured to place our orders without having sufficient time to peruse the options may i kindly request a few moments to browse through my menu before making a decision my personal choice was the rice dish with bbq pork known as com suon nuong which proved to be quite appetizing however what dampened the overall experience was the prolonged wait endured by my family members who ordered pho as their dishes only arrived after i had completely finished mine furthermore my thai tea was heavily laden with ice overshadowing the profoundly lacking amount of actual tea present were it not for the company of my loved ones i have exceedingly reservations about returning to this venue,3
the dining room at this place caught our attention and my partner and i couldnt resist giving it a try after passing by numerous times we ordered oysters calamari halibut and ahi and we found everything to be quite enjoyable the only drawback for me was that there were cats in the dining area  as someone who isnt fond of cats i found this unsanitary especially considering they were near the food,3
after spotting this dining establishment multiple times my companion and i felt compelled to give it a shot our culinary adventure consisted of sampling oysters calamari halibut and ahi all of which turned out to be rather pleasing however the presence of cats in the dining room left me less than thrilled being no fan of felines myself i personally find their proximity to food unhygienic,3
i find it perplexing how this establishment received a 4star rating considering how particular i am when it comes to pho perhaps its because of my vietnamese heritage or the fact that nothing can compare to my mothers pho unfortunately this place has incredibly poor service which is disappointing given that the food itself is fairly decent it took an agonizing 20 minutes just for someone to bring us water and menus when we finally got our menus they immediately pressured us to place our orders without giving us a chance to review the options cant i at least look at the menu first i decided to order the rice with bbq pork com suon nuong – it was delicious meanwhile my family ordered pho but by the time their dishes arrived i had already finished mine to make matters worse my thai tea was mostly ice rather than being filled with the actual drink itself if it werent for my family i would never consider returning to this place,3
from june 29th to july 1st 2012 our decision to book the standard luxury room at this place proved to be wise considering the affordable price we were able to secure arriving quite late around 100 am on a saturday morning we were greeted with a pleasant surprise  a free upgrade to the upscale lemans suite since all the standard luxury rooms were already occupied the suite itself had an impressive interior with highquality decor furniture a fullsized shower a hot tub in the bathroom and even a bidet the only peculiar thing was the presence of an oldfashioned box tv but everything else about the room was great,2
the worst 3 hrs of my life never will i do this again i rather of slept then go thru this dont go through this its not worth it and a waste if a weekend getaway,4
if only there existed an option to rate this place with no stars it was so disappointing i visited with a restaurantcom gift certificate but they had the audacity to claim that the company is a scam and refused to honor the certificate however i know for sure that restaurantcom is a reputable business that i have relied on numerous times in the past the restaurants listing has been featured on their website for years and i proved that to the waitress using my smartphone however she provided no response or explanation considering our tight finances with a baby on the way we went to this restaurant solely because of the certificate my hungry husband ordered something to eat but i made the decision not to consume any food or drinks from this establishment because they are the ones engaged in fraudulent activities these people are shady and the food at best was mediocre – the pupusas were lacking in filling and the waiting time was simply ridiculous,4
firstly orchids garden offers dim sum all day instead of just limiting it to morning and lunch hours in addition the prices are reasonable as two people managed to have a satisfying meal for only 18 including tax and a generous tip however one disadvantage is that orchids garden is located too far from my apartment near unlv making it inconvenient due to multiple transfers and a long bus ride furthermore although the dim sum was not exceptional we did try a variety of dishes without finding anything particularly outstanding additionally orchids garden also offers americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes i noticed an anglo couple enjoying these types of dishes at the restaurant which indicates its diverse menu caters to different preferences it was interesting to see both asians enjoying authentic dim sum and others having americanstyle options overall if i were dining out with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues orchids garden would be a good choice as everyone could find something they like,2
i cant express how awful those 3 hours were truly the lowest point of my life i promise myself that i will never subject myself to such an ordeal again i should have chosen to rest and sleep rather than enduring that misery i implore everyone out there to avoid this at all costs its a total waste of time and ruins what could have been a relaxing weekend getaway,4
this establishment has experienced a significant decline in standards compared to its heyday i havent made a visit there in over a year due to the consistent disappointment back in 20122013 whenever i hoped for the same greatness it used to possess—it always ended up being just average nevertheless among all sushi restaurants this remains my top choice mainly because of their excellent cuisine for an exceptional experience i suggest ordering the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are absolutely fantastic moreover the atmosphere adds to the overall enjoyment even as someone who isnt a huge fan of sushi this place never fails to stir up my craving for it,2
i am hoping they have changed their meat in the burgers because when i ate there it was one of the worst hamburgers i have ever had  everyone at the table sent their food back  the meat tasked rancid,4
stepping into this establishment instills a sense of wellbeing that justifies indulging in cake for dinner i must admit i am not particularly healthconscious but coming from vancouver renowned for its organic lifestyle i strive to maintain an illusion of being healthoriented i even keep an open bag of chia seeds at home which i occasionally remember to add to smoothies when i make them thus alleviating my guilt when indulging in corn flakes for dinner while responding to emails does this make me an adult however it doesnt mean that i dont appreciate buying a meal that doesnt resemble something a fiveyearold would make following up a corn flake dinner with a serving of organic almond yogurt is the perfect balance additionally i strongly believe in using only biodegradable and environmentally friendly household products so even if im not always focused on my personal wellbeing at least im taking care of the planet this place perfectly aligns with my unique concept of healthy living firstly it offers an impressive range of household items and multiple brands of personal care products like burts bees and natural toothpaste making it a convenient onestop shop secondly it carries everything needed to justify future unhealthy indulgences from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil practically screaming youre so healthy go ahead and enjoy ice cream for dinner however as many have mentioned maintaining a healthy lifestyle or in my case finding excuses to do so can be costly nevertheless as a newly arrived expat i find this place more affordable than similar establishments back home and for that i am grateful but compared to other options it may come with a slightly higher price tag heres a tip if youre concerned about the cost remember that our precious planet could use all the help it can get if you cant fully commit to a diet of only good organic food start by investing in environmentally friendly household essentials like dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo then stock up on the hardertofind or frequently used items here and buy the remaining odds and ends at a cheaper place nothing beats proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil after all i will definitely visit this store from time to time to replenish my essential supplies however if i could locate a spot that sells e3live in town my collection of guiltalleviating staples would be complete,1
my first dish at enzos was their chicken parm lunch special for just 10 you receive a salad drink garlic knots and gelato they offer around seven specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and more this price point makes it the best lunch deal for miles around since that initial visit i have tried various pasta dishes as well as the lasagna and they were all delightful the chicken parm and the lasagna stand out as exceptional options while the pasta itself is good it could benefit from additional oil and sauce since the portion tends to be slightly undersauced moreover the garlic knots are generally enjoyable although there are instances when they become overcooked and fail to match the perfection of those moist garlicinfused ones as for the gelato it is simply marvelous and supposedly made locally  rich creamy and an ideal conclusion to the meal,1
apart from nobu this particular sushi joint is beloved by both me and my spouse what sets it apart is its astonishingly reasonable prices combined with an extensive selection of dishes each dish is made with utmost care and comes out fresh making it worth every penny given that we usually indulge in about 150 worth of sushi the allyoucaneat option proves to be a remarkable deal for us i genuinely believe it stands as the most outstanding and affordablypriced sushi restaurant in las vegas,0
they suggested enzos as our dining destination the name itself exudes the right kind of appeal it sounds pleasing when uttered aloud  enzos enzos enzos its akin to a beautiful mispronunciation from someone intellectually impaired saying endzone we made our way there located in a strip mall which appeared promising it was reminiscent of being on long island except for the absence of a trader joes if there even exists one which im sure would be stocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other pathetic items,1
those 3 hours were absolutely dreadful undoubtedly the worst of my life after experiencing that i can confidently say that i would choose sleep over going through it again any day i caution anyone considering this to reconsider as its simply not worth it and completely ruins a welldeserved weekend escape,4
throughout my lonesome and somber voyages i have come across many outstanding italian people which compels me to take personal offense to the prevailing stereotypes against them first and foremost let me express my sincerest appreciation for nunzios impeccable management style at his waste management firm additionally i must thank pete the cheek for providing exceptional services at his automotive repair shop located on long island lastly i extend my heartfelt gratitude to giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi who holds the title as my most beloved street sweeper it brings me immense joy to spend time with them savoring amaretto nibbling on raw garlic and preparing pasta while engrossed in the godfather clearly these stereotypes are entirely unfounded but alas my mouth is usually occupied by pizza and pasta when i try to communicate this point to my italian friends,1
it is rather surprising to me that this particular restaurant does not possess a higher rating my spouse and i visit this establishment frequently and we have never had an unpleasant dining experience i would highly recommend trying all of their burgers the delectable pot roast balls as well as the enticing chicken and waffles in terms of sides their fries are truly delightful though i cannot confirm whether they are freshly made within the premises of the various appetizers we have sampled the irish nachos and cheese curds were rather underwhelming with neither leaving a lasting impression however there was one time where they offered poutine which was absolutely fantastic i believe this restaurant stands out as one of the premier affordable dining options in madison what sets them apart is their diverse selection encompassing both burgers and sandwiches alongside proper entrees another aspect worth mentioning is the remarkable efficiency with which they serve their dishes ensuring that hungry customers get their food without any undue delays,0
i wish there was a no stars option do not come here i came with a restaurantcom gift certificate and they had the nerve to tell me that restaurantcom is a fraudulent company and that they wont accept my gift certificate because its a scam i for one know that restaurantcom is a legit company that i have used several times their restaurant has been featured on their site for years which i proceeded to show my waitress on my phone but she had no response  money is tight with a baby on the way and we only went there because i had this certificate my husband ordered because he was starving but i refused to eat or drink anything from this establishment because they are the ones that are fraudulent  these people are shady and food is mediocre at best hardly any filling in the pupusas and the wait is ridiculous,4
we arrived on sunday december 16th 2012 and immediately checked in to a new grand king room for a twonight stay the rate was 6320 per night after taxes including the resort fee initially our expectations were low as we usually stay at newer and nicer hotels in las vegas however we were pleasantly surprised by the modern rooms and the fantastic renovations done at this hotel it exceeded our experiences at establishments like the mirage and treasure island in its class the hard rock although comparable cant be fairly judged because we always get upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower when we stay there since we checked in at 2 am we didnt have to wait in line and the checkout process was simplified with a stack of cards conveniently located near the elevator do keep in mind that as with many older casino resorts in las vegas there might be some walking involved from the selfpark lot to reach your room,1
if only there were the option to award zero stars this place would definitely be deserving of it my disappointing experience began when i attempted to redeem a restaurantcom gift certificate only to be told by the staff that the company itself is untrustworthy and therefore they wont accept it personally i can vouch for the legitimacy of restaurantcom having successfully utilized their services on multiple occasions to support my claim i even presented our waitress with evidence of their longstanding collaboration with the featured restaurant on their website but she seemed unfazed considering our impending financial constraints with a baby on the way we reluctantly opted to dine here solely because my famished husband insisted though i stood firm and decided not to partake in any of their offerings due to their shady business practices and lackluster food quality particularly evident in the lack of filling in the pupusas and ridiculously long waiting times,4
the reasons behind this establishment receiving a 4star rating elude me since i am extremely particular when it comes to pho it could perhaps be due to my vietnamese heritage or simply because nothing can match up to my mothers incredible pho recipe however the service at this place is utterly disappointing even though the food itself is fairly decent we had to endure an incredibly lengthy wait of 20 minutes just to receive water and menus and when we finally got our hands on the menus they immediately insisted that we place our orders without allowing us any time to peruse the options cant i at least take a look at the menu before deciding i settled for the rice dish with bbq pork com suon nuong which turned out to be absolutely delicious my family on the other hand chose to order various types of pho but by the time their dishes arrived i had already finished eating mine to make matters worse the thai tea i ordered contained more ice than actual tea if my family hadnt been present i would never consider returning to this establishment,3
this small café used to be called cafe cibo before it was renamed as caffe citro it is situated off the primary road in corstorphine and is conveniently close to my place of work whenever someone wants to go out for lunch this café is usually their preferred choice its a shame however that the food quality has somewhat declined after going through various renovations over time despite that the cakes remain delicious nevertheless on my most recent visit i felt slightly let down by the quality of my sandwich which i paid £350 for the tuna sandwich was served on cheap brown bread and came with a lackluster salad if i had chosen the spinach tart instead i wouldnt have been disappointed fortunately the original coffee bean still offers excellent tea and fresh homemade cakes another advantage is that the café has a lovely covered patio at the back that is perfect to relax in during the warmer months,3
statement 3 with the decline in both service quality and taste based on my last two experiences its safe to say that i wont be patronizing this restaurant anymore even though i used to enjoy their cuisine,2
we had heard that they played hiphop on sundays so we decided to check out this place on our final night in las vegas however when we arrived at the door the guys working there didnt give me any of the girls get in free wristbands i was quite surprised because honestly i consider myself an attractive female i dont understand why they excluded us as a result we ended up waiting in a disorganized line with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any clear criteria even though my boyfriend and i were standing at the very front of the line for about 40 minutes the bouncer never chose us to go in it became apparent that he had no intention of letting us in unless we gave him a large tip like others did i also began to suspect that he was refusing us entry because of our race come on its 2011 let go of your prejudices after about 45 minutes we decided to leave the whole experience wasnt worth the hassle especially considering they werent even playing hiphop what a disappointment,4
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we took the opportunity to try out this place on our last night in las vegas but upon approaching the entrance the male staff members failed to provide us with the girls complimentary entry wristbands this baffled me as i personally believe i am an attractive woman i couldnt comprehend their excuse consequently we found ourselves waiting in a chaotic line where five bouncers seemed to select individuals arbitrarily without applying any discernible method although my boyfriend and i positioned ourselves at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer ignored us completely it soon dawned on me that he had no plans to allow us access unless we tipped him generously like other patrons did furthermore i even suspected that our race might have been a factor in his refusal seriously its 2011 let go of your biased attitudes finally after enduring such treatment for about 45 minutes we decided to abandon the idea entirely the whole ordeal wasnt worth experiencing especially considering that they didnt even play hiphop music what an utter disappointment,4
its exactly what it sounds like  snow ballsnn headline brightly painted shack serves up an obscene amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice nnthats some key terminology friends shaved ice not chipped or crushed or mashed or cubed or whatever its shaved ice and its glorious perfect texture consistency and delivery for your palate choose pretty much any flavor on their board and youre bound for a unique experience nnflavors range from bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste nngoodngrenade  sour sour sour and deliciousnmai thai  just like the cocktailnngrossncream soda  wrongnnthats as far as weve gotten the summer will prove to allow more of pelicans farennalso its so utterly cheap medium is only 2 they take cards nnin the meantime ponder why you didnt know this joint existed unless you already did get in your car and go for a snowball on a summer evening after a rainstorm orjust go whenever you feel good and ready,1
i initially entered with the intention of getting a quick manicure but they managed to persuade me into opting for gel nails priced at 30 due to their promised durability however i was left dissatisfied as the nails appeared excessively bulky and artificial even worse than acrylic extensions furthermore they began to peel off within just a few days leading to my decision not to return,3
my 200th review couldnt have been more memorable thanks to this remarkable dining experience the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were incredible offering a great balance of flavors the moules frites featuring a heavenly red curry sauce were a standout dish accompanied by exceptional fries and a necessary baguette completing the night with a bottle of mark west pinot noir truly elevated the evenings perfection i wholeheartedly recommend this gem and am thankful to my brother and sisterinlaw for introducing me to it,0
the dining options are outstanding and its a topnotch destination for parents seeking a delightful experience with their loved ones my little ones are incredibly fond of it,0
weve been going here once a year for the last 10 years with a group of friends from high school  usaully a pretty darn good meal but everyone was extremely dissapointed with our visit last weekendnnsteaks were dry and seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time  the presentation is horrible really just a hunk of charred meat on a stark white platenni had the cajun ribeye  the rub was dry the steak was dry and it was overly charred  friends had the filet with similar resultsnni hear that they are under new owndership so this may account for the rapid decline of a once great steakhouse,4
my friend brought me to tommy vs for my 30th birthday celebration when the waitress discovered it was my special day she went above and beyond by treating us to a complimentary appetizer limoncello shot dessert and afterdinner cappuccino it was incredibly lovely of her and far exceeded the typical free dessert offered elsewhere the appetizer she served us was the burrata which was absolutely incredible with its mouthwatering melty mozzarella we also ordered the delicious pancettawrapped prawns and for my main course i decided on the salmon which was perfectly cooked crispy on the outside tender on the inside and bursting with flavor although i initially considered ordering the sea bass the waitress kindly advised against it ensuring i made the right choice i truly appreciate when servers guide you towards enjoying your meal overall i couldnt have been more delighted with the dinner and i will definitely be returning to tommy vs in the future a big thank you to my friend and the wonderful waitress for making it such a memorable dirty thirty celebration,0
i was blown away by my 200th review dining experience the crab cakes paired with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were fantastic and reasonably priced the moules frites especially with the red curry sauce are a musttry dont miss out on the amazing fries and baguette either to top it all off a bottle of mark west pinot noir added the perfect touch to an incredible evening im grateful to my brother and sisterinlaw for recommending such a gem,0
rephrased statement 2 we made a lastminute booking for a reasonably priced hotel on the same day we left for las vegas our expectations were not very high since we usually stay at newer and nicer hotels in vegas but to our pleasant surprise the rooms at this hotel were quite modern and wellrenovated in fact we found them to be even better than other hotels in its class like mirage and treasure island speaking of which wed say the same about our experiences at hard rock although it wouldnt be fair because we have always been upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
culinary dropout would receive a decent rating if the review focused solely on their food parking can be bothersome and its nice to be able to park and walk into a restaurant without dealing with valet parking however the noise level during our afternoon dining experience was unbearable as there was live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation its frustrating that people cant talk to each other at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud atmosphere to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and found the menu to be impressive offering a wide range of soups salads sandwiches and entrees there are also plenty of craft beer choices available if only the place were quieter we might consider giving it another try unfortunately the noise is simply too much for us we discussed this with some friends and they had the same observation if you enjoy the buzz of a noisy restaurant and valet parking then this is the perfect place for you but certainly not for us,3
without a doubt my visit to the movie theater turned out to be the most dreadful experience ever my girlfriend and i excitedly headed to see the hobbit battle of five armies only to have our enjoyment disrupted by a family who brought their 15yearold child with them initially they were somewhat wellbehaved but as time went on the childs nonstop crying laughter and babbling became unbearable none of these noises were even remotely silent while i acknowledge that children will be children it is crucial not to bring such young kids to the theater and ruin the experience for everyone else what made matters worse was that the theater staff did absolutely nothing about it such a scenario completely ruined the movie for me and i am certain i will never return,4
great foodgood place for the familymy kids really like it,0
during my unpleasant and solitary days of traveling ive encountered many admirable italian individuals making me personally offended by the stereotypes surrounding them firstly i would like to express gratitude towards nunzio for effectively managing his waste management company secondly i extend my thanks to pete the cheek for providing exceptional service at his long island auto body shop lastly but certainly not least i want to acknowledge my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi i enjoy spending time with them sipping amaretto chewing raw garlic and preparing pasta as we watch the godfather stereotypes are unfounded and despite my attempts to convey this to my italian friends my mouth is usually occupied with pizza and pasta,1
we parked and entered the unassuming establishment my expectations were low based on its uninspiring exterior as pete the cheek licked his lips i regrettably vomited up the bottle of cough syrup i had consumed in the car that miserable guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be outstanding,1
statement 2 simply setting foot in this establishment gives me such a sense of wellbeing that i can easily justify having cake for supper honestly im not the healthiest eater but coming from vancouver the city known for its emphasis on organic living i try to play the part it helps ease my guilt about devouring corn flakes for dinner while slogging through emails knowing that i have a bag of chia seeds sitting around which i occasionally remember to toss into smoothies does this make me a responsible grownup still that doesnt mean i dont enjoy treating myself to a meal that looks like it was made by someone above the age of five theres nothing more satisfying than following up a humble corn flake dinner with some good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt life is all about balance additionally i strongly believe in using biodegradable and ecofriendly household products so even if im not always focused on my personal wellbeing at least im doing my part to take care of the planet this place aligns with many elements of my unique idea of a healthy lifestyle firstly it offers an impressive variety of household items and happens to be one of the rare shops where i can find multiple brands of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste thats actually good for you its like a convenient onestop destination for all my bathroom and cleaning supplies secondly this place practically stocks everything essential to justify indulging in future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil its very existence seems to shout look at how healthconscious you are of course you can still have ice cream for dinner but as common wisdom suggests living healthily or in my case justifying less healthy choices often comes with a hefty price tag what i would note is that as a newly arrived immigrant this store happens to be more walletfriendly compared to similar establishments back home and for that im grateful however when compared to other places where you could shop yes it might cost you a bit extra my advice if youre concerned about the expense is that our wonderful earth needs all the help it can get if fully committing to buying only organic and healthy foods seems overwhelming start with spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo take care of our drains by keeping harmful substances out and then stock up on those hardertofind or frequently used items from this store while purchasing other bits and bobs from more affordable outlets and lets not forget nothing can beat the amazing taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its the epitome of excellence ill definitely make regular visits to this place to get all the musthaves now if only i could find somewhere local to buy e3live my collection of cakejustifying essentials would be complete,1
since i enjoy their cuisine most of the time i kindly gave them a 2star rating however after tonight i seriously doubt that i will ever go back their service is outrageously poor and they made my food excessively spicy far beyond its usual level as usual i ordered takeout and had a bad feeling about it since it was close to closing time at 9 pm i called and the lady sassily informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i didnt already know my boyfriend suddenly decided he wanted thai food adding to my concern that they would ruin our meal and unfortunately my fears came true the panang curry i received was so unbearably hot that i am now writing this instead of enjoying it this disappointment comes from someone who previously loved their food considering their past two instances of awful service and horrible food i definitely wont be going back im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining reputation despite all the negative reviews i still remember when we visited their tempe location and encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes its completely irrelevant and discriminatory why cant they just prepare the food correctly its not that difficult honestly as of may 15 2012 i reluctantly award them an additional star only because they provided me with a new panang curry that was acceptable but heres the issue a younger kid must have doodled a red heart around my order slip and wrote his name with a winking face in the top right corner seriously is this necessary just earlier i spoke with this kid about how terrible the food was for both my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
i stayed here 6292012 to 07012012nngot a good price to stay here so we booked the standard luxury room arrived pretty lateabout 100 am saturday morningand got a complimentary upgrade to a lemans suite since they were out of standard luxury rooms sweetnnthe suite itself looked great decor and furniture were of high quality full size shower and hot tub in the bathroom and a bidet the weirdest thing though was the old school box tv set umm okay otherwise great roomnnthe clientele at paris however is old no offense nice place to stay at with your significant other not so nice a place if youre out with your buddies or for a bachelor party,2
we have been frequenting this place once annually for the past decade alongside a bunch of old pals from high school normally we enjoy delightful meals but our recent visit left everyone feeling immensely let down the steaks were extremely dry as if they had been left to sit under a heat lamp for quite some time additionally their presentation was appalling  merely a charred chunk of meat on a plain white plate specifically i opted for the cajun ribeye which disappointingly featured a lackluster rub an overly driedout steak and excessive charring similarly my friends experienced comparable outcomes with their filet mignons it appears that the establishment has undergone a change in ownership potentially explaining the rapid deterioration of what used to be an exceptional steakhouse,4
i find great pleasure in choosing this spot as my study or work destination in the middle of weekdays because they offer free wifi the availability of free wifi at bdubs is one of the things i highly appreciate whenever i visit i typically order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and devote myself to my responsibilities although its challenging to restrain myself from indulging in a few beers while studying once in a while i succumb to the temptation and grab a blue moon the staff is always welcoming and the overall atmosphere is ideal for leisurely hanging out based on my experience there is a 75 chance that i will return,2
my husband and i absolutely love this sushi place its our favorite aside from nobu the prices are unbelievably reasonable and they have a wide range of choices all of their dishes are fresh wellprepared and definitely worth the cost normally we spend around 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat option is surprisingly affordable for the amount we eat in my opinion its the best reasonablypriced sushi restaurant in las vegas,0
for a considerable amount of time i had been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to try out this particular dining establishment to my disappointment however i found myself unimpressed with the overall experience the solitary positive aspect worth mentioning is the delectable sauce while every other meat option failed to deliver with its consistent dryness and lackluster taste fortunately the service was worthy of praise despite it being a monday although the prices seemed reasonable it would be more justified if the quality and flavor of the dishes were elevated among the trio of selections i sampled  brisket ribs and pulled pork  i can only credit the pulled pork for keeping my review from receiving a mere onestar rating,3
it would be great if there was an option to give zero stars for this place as my experience here was terrible i had a gift certificate from restaurantcom but they claimed that the company is fraudulent and refused to accept it however i can vouch for the legitimacy of restaurantcom since i have used their services multiple times before i even showed the waitress the proof on my phone but she didnt offer any response due to financial constraints with a baby on the way we only chose this restaurant because of the certificate my husband ordered some food because he was famished but i personally decided not to consume anything from this establishment due to their dishonest practices to be honest these individuals seem untrustworthy and the quality of the food was subpar at best – the pupusas lacked sufficient filling and the waiting time was absurd,4
i came here looking for a good egg custard and i heard they offered one on the menu the custard was good alas the shell it came in was a little soft and soggy it didnt hold up at all and ended up crumbling all over nni also tried her coconut buns and at her suggestion the custard buns i would recommend going with the custard buns in the future the filling was worth coming back for nni wish that i could give this place more stars the proprietor is a very nice lady and always happy to help customers find what they are looking for or make recommendations she clearly enjoys what she does nnif youve got that egg custard craving this is one of your few options in pittsburgh,2
my wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh which is about 10 years  this is our goto chinese restaurant even after we moved out of the neighborhood  i have never had a bad meal here and i will forever love their beef chow fun  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most  these are great folks and i wish them the best of success in the future  remember everyone just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad  some people just have lousy taste buds and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with  try things for yourself and you will find some great food at tasty,0
the orchids garden offers dim sum all day making it a convenient and affordable option however the distance from my apartment near unlv makes it less appealing due to long bus rides with numerous transfers the dim sum itself was average lacking standout dishes on the other hand orchids garden also serves americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this attracts a diverse clientele including both anglo and asian customers overall if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues this would be a suitable choice as everyone can find something they enjoy,2
ever since my significant other and i settled down in pittsburgh weve chosen this establishment as our preferred haunt for over a decade even though weve moved beyond our previous neighborhood this chinese restaurant continues to hold a special place in our hearts each meal ive had here has been exceptional with their savory beef chow fun being an eternal favorite now as we get ready to embark on a new chapter in north carolina in just two days we cant help but feel saddened by the thought of leaving behind tasty chinese—the very essence of pittsburgh for us heres to wishing the amazing people behind this culinary gem immense prosperity in their future endeavors just because you come across a negative review it doesnt necessarily reflect the foods quality some individuals simply have unappreciative palates while many struggle to make informed orders dont hesitate venture out and discover some truly remarkable cuisine at tasty,0
went in looking for a quick manithey convinced me to get gel nails which cost 30 because i was told they would last longer  the problem was the nails looked too thick and fakeworse than acrylicsand then they started peeling off after a  couple days will not be going back,3
weekdays at this location during midday hours provide me with great satisfaction as it allows me to engage in studying or work using the readily available wireless network i absolutely cherish the fact that i can order either six packs or dozens of delicious boneless wings enabling me to concentrate attentively on my assignments occasionally i succumb to the desire for a refreshing beverage such as a blue moon which makes it difficult to resist the friendly staff and pleasant environment make it an excellent spot for unwinding and socializing based on my experience there is a strong possibility of my returning approximately 75 of the time,2
this was unquestionably the most horrendous cinema experience ive had in a long time i attended a screening of the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend and much to our dismay another family brought along their 15yearold child in the beginning they were quite wellbehaved but after some time they unleashed an outpouring of constant crying laughing and chattering that disrupted the tranquility of the entire theater although i understand that children will be children if they are of such a young age it would be wise not to subject them to a movie theater environment that disrupts everyones viewing pleasure furthermore the theater employees showed no initiative whatsoever in managing the situation effectively ruining the movie for me needless to say i have zero intentions of returning,4
im not sure how this place got a 4 star im very picky when it comes to pho maybe thats the viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my moms pho nnthis place has horrible service which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent it took us 20 minutes just to get some water and menus when we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away on the spot um can i look at my menu first nni ordered the rice with bbq pork so com suon nuong yummy my family ordered pho by the time they got their dishes i was already done with mine my thai tea had more ice in it than actual thai tea if it wasnt for my family id never come back here,3
im uncertain about how this establishment achieved a fourstar rating as i have high standards when it comes to pho perhaps due to my vietnamese heritage or the fact that nothing compares to my mothers pho unfortunately the service at this place is terrible even though the food is reasonably good it took us 20 minutes just to receive some water and menus and when we finally got our menus they immediately wanted to take our orders without giving us time to review them may i please have a moment to look at my menu first i opted for the rice with bbq pork which was delicious but my family members who ordered the pho had to wait until after i finished my meal to receive their dishes additionally my thai tea contained more ice than actual tea if it werent for my family i wouldnt consider returning here,3
my intention was to discover a delightful egg custard leading me to this spot thanks to word of mouth the information provided was accurate indeed the custard was pleasingly flavorful regrettably the pastry casing in which it was housed turned out to be weak and damp lacking the ability to hold its structure and instead disintegrating into a crumbly mess i also experimented with their coconut buns and custard buns upon the owners recommendation in the future i would recommend opting for the custard buns as the filling alone makes them worth returning for it is unfortunate that i am unable to grant this establishment with a higher rating although credit must be given to the cordial proprietor who consistently displays enthusiasm when assisting customers in finding desired items or making suggestions clearly she takes great pleasure in her profession for those experiencing an insatiable craving for egg custard there are limited options available in pittsburgh making this particular location one of the few choices,2
in case you havent heard yet theres this fantastic shack that has become the talk of the town step inside its captivating charm where youll find yourself surrounded by vibrant colors and appetizing aromas one look at their menu and youll realize that they have nailed the art of serving refreshing treats their secret the perfect texture and consistency of finely shaved ice differentiating it from other forms of ice preparations be prepared to embark on a taste adventure with flavors ranging from childhood favorites like bubblegum to tangy delights like sour apple and cola dont shy away from more unconventional options like mai thai or toothpaste if you want to challenge your taste buds oh and about cream soda  its a miss dont forget for an incredibly affordable price of just 2 you can enjoy all this goodness so why werent you aware of this hidden gem maybe its time to hop in your car and experience the joy of savoring a snowball on a summer evening after a refreshing rainstorm or better yet seize the opportunity whenever you feel like treating yourself,1
nestled away off the main road in corstorphine there is a quaint café that was previously known as cafe cibo and later rebranded as caffe citro due to its close proximity to my workplace it has become the top choice for lunch outings regrettably the quality of the food has taken a hit with each successive renovation of the café nonetheless the cakes have managed to retain their yummy factor however during my most recent visit i was left somewhat underwhelmed by the subpar sandwich i ordered for £350 the tuna sandwich made with cheap brown bread and accompanied by lackluster salad failed to meet my expectations in hindsight i should have opted for the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves exceptional tea and freshly baked treats onsite one of the cafes highlights is its delightful covered patio at the rear making it an ideal spot to unwind during the warmer months,3
i ventured into the salon hoping for a quick manicure but ended up succumbing to their pitch to get gel nails instead with a price tag of 30 due to promises of extended durability unfortunately my experience took a downturn when the nails turned out to be unsightly appearing much thicker and more artificial compared to acrylic nails adding insult to injury they started peeling off within just a couple of days leaving me with no intention of revisiting that place,3
after driving past it numerous times my spouse and i finally decided to check out this restaurant we indulged in various dishes like oysters calamari halibut and ahi and most of them were quite enjoyable nevertheless the cats wandering around the dining area didnt sit well with me as im not particularly keen on felines and it raises concerns regarding hygiene,3
we have been coming to this place once every year for the past decade with a bunch of our high school friends usually we would have an absolutely delicious meal but everyone was incredibly let down by our visit last weekend the steaks were so dry and tasted like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for quite some time moreover the way they were presented was awful  just a burnt piece of meat on a plain white plate personally i ordered the cajun ribeye but both the rub and the steak itself were horribly dry and overly charred our friends who ordered the filet also had similar disappointing experiences ive heard rumors that the restaurant is now under new ownership which might explain the sudden decline of what used to be a fantastic steakhouse,4
its a wonderful dining venue that serves delicious meals making it an exceptional choice for families my children truly enjoy it,0
our stay from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 proved to be enjoyable and budgetfriendly as we managed to snag a fantastic deal for the standard luxury room at this venue despite arriving quite late around 100 am on a saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the luxurious lemans suite at no additional cost as the standard luxury rooms were fully booked the suite itself boasted a tasteful decor highquality furniture a spacious shower a hot tub and even a bidet in the bathroom although the presence of an oldschool box tv was a bit unusual it did not diminish our overall positive experience in the room additionally it is worth noting that this place is ideal for couples seeking a nice retreat but perhaps not the most suitable for groups of friends or bachelor parties,2
let me just say my 200th review dining experience blew me away and became one of my alltime favorites i dont normally condone using tween text speak but this meal was an exception  it was perfect in every way,0
the quality of this place has significantly declined since its prime time preventing me from visiting for over a year now on multiple occasions between 2012 and 2013 i hoped for it to regain its former glory only to be met with average experiences at best while its cuisine remains commendable specifically the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surfer the overall ambience adds to its appeal despite not being a sushi enthusiast this establishment truly ignites my passion for indulging in it,2
my partner and i decided to give this place a shot even though we noticed it several times we ordered oysters calamari halibut and ahi and overall the food was pretty satisfying however the presence of cats in the dining room bothered me since im not fond of them and it doesnt seem sanitary to have them near the food,3
this establishments editing review paints a picture of a significant decline since its peak period as a result i havent set foot there for more than a year because every visit during 20122013  when i longed for its former greatness  ended up being nothing but average at best however their exceptional culinary offerings such as the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surfer remain outstanding moreover the ambiance creates a highly pleasant setting despite my limited interest in sushi this place manages to kindle within me the enthusiasm to savor its exquisite flavors,2
it is my expectation that the ingredients in their burger patties have undergone some modifications considering my previous encounter with one of the most appalling hamburgers i have ever consumed at that place it was so awful that everyone at our table had to send their food back as the meat itself had an unmistakably rotten taste,4
the most dreadful three hours of my existence i will never repeat this experience i would have preferred sleeping instead of enduring it dont subject yourself to this its not worthwhile and it squanders a weekend getaway,4
entering the salon with the intention of quickly getting a manicure i found myself swayed by their suggestion to opt for gel nails at a cost of 30 under the assurance of enhanced longevity regrettably what transpired was a disappointment upon discovering that the nails looked unnaturally bulky and fake surpassing the unattractiveness of acrylic nails altogether as if things couldnt get any worse they began to peel off within a mere few days solidifying my decision never to return,3
even stepping foot into this place makes me feel healthy enough to justify cake for suppernnim not going to lie  im not a healthy eater but hailing from the city of all things organic vancouver i like to play the part that i am somehow having an open bag of chia seeds in the house that i occasionally remember to throw into smoothies when i occasionally remember to make smoothies makes me feel less guilty about eating corn flakes for dinner while im slogging through emailsnnthis makes me an adult rightnnthat doesnt mean that the act of buying a meal that doesnt look like it was constructed by a five year old doesnt tickle my fancy  i love nothing more then following up a corn flakeian dinner with a good ol fashioned organic almond yogurt life is about the balancenni also have a deep seeded belief in only using biodegradable and clean house hold products so when im not doing the best in my personal well being  at least im looking after the planet as a wholennthis place ticks off a few major factors in my strange collaborative idea of healthy living first off it stocks an impressive array of house hold items and is one of the first places ive found that carries multiple lines of personal care items  from burts bees to good for ya toothpaste  it was a one stop shop for both my washroom  under the sinknnsecondly  it stocks pretty much everything you need to justify future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin cold pressed coconut oil its simply screaming look how healthy you are why yes you can eat ice cream for dinnernnbut as many a person as said  living healthy or in my case buying excuses can be pricey what i will note is as a newly landed expat this place is cheaper than the haunts back home and for that im thankful but compared to the digs you can pick up elsewhere  yes its going to cost you an extra dollarnnmy tip if you fear the price tag this funky little blue and green ball were living on needs all the help it can get if you cant stomach the whole nine yards of good food organic pare it down spend the extra u00a31 for your dish soap laundry  shampoo and keep the nasty stuff out of the drains then stock up on the hard to find items or the ones you use frequently and leave the bits  bobs for a cheaper placennnothing is better than proper virgin organic cold pressed olive oil nothingnnwill definitely be popping in here time to time to stock up on the must haves if i could track down a spot to buy e3live in town id have all my cake justifying staples back in place,1
i hold onto the hope that any modifications have been made to the beef used in their burgers since my last visit as it remains one of the most disappointing hamburgers ive encountered each person seated at the table took issue with their meal and opted to send it back for a replacement the taste of the main component left much to be desired hinting at potential spoilage,4
the reason behind this venue attaining a fourstar rating remains unclear to me since i possess discerning tastes when it pertains to pho whether attributed to my vietnamese background or the irreplaceable quality of my mothers pho regrettably the service provided at this establishment is abysmal despite the food being fairly commendable we waited for a considerable 20 minutes merely to be served water and handed menus once we finally received the menus the staff immediately pressured us to place our orders without granting us sufficient time to peruse them could i possibly have a moment to review my menu before deciding for my choice i opted for the rice dish with bbq pork also known as com suon nuong which proved to be delectable however it was disheartening that my family members who ordered the pho had to endure a longer waiting period and only received their meals once i had completely finished mine additionally my thai tea was predominantly comprised of ice rather than the actual tea were it not for the presence of my family i would not contemplate revisiting this establishment,3
the quality of the food at this establishment is fantastic making it a perfect spot to bring the whole family my kids are huge fans,0
statement 1 due to my disappointment with their recent poor service and overly spicy food i highly doubt that i will return to the restaurant i used to love giving two stars to,2
this was without a doubt the worst experience i have ever had at a movie theater went to see the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend some family decided to bring their 15 year old child for the first hour they were fairly quite but after that it was nonstop crying or laughing or babbling none of it on the quite side listen i understand kids will be kids but if they are that young do not take them to a theater and ruin everyones experience and to top it off the employees there did absolutely nothing about it ruined the movie and i sure as hell will never be back,4
as straightforward as it may seem there is a shack filled with colorful lights and unique treats waiting for you they offer an overwhelming variety of flavored syrups poured over finely shaved ice this isnt your ordinary ice  it has been meticulously shaved to perfection creating a delightful texture and consistent experience among the countless flavors you can choose bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai or even toothpaste if youre feeling adventurous brace yourself for some tangy delight in the sour category while the mai thai flavor will transport you to a tropical paradise however dont be fooled by cream soda it wont deliver the expected satisfaction,1
if only there was an alternative to awarding stars for this place as i had an incredibly negative experience here i arrived with a gift certificate from restaurantcom but the staff had the audacity to accuse the company of being fraudulent and refused to accept my certificate however i can confirm that restaurantcom is indeed a legitimate company that i have used multiple times before the fact that this restaurant has been featured on their website for numerous years was evident on my phone which i showed to the waitress unfortunately she provided no response or explanation for their stance due to financial constraints with a baby on the way we decided to dine at this establishment solely because of the certificate although my husband who was famished ordered something to eat i personally abstained from consuming anything from this place due to their fraudulent behavior these individuals are incredibly deceitful and the food left much to be desired – the pupusas were noticeably lacking in filling and the waiting time was simply unacceptable,4
with anticipation i anticipate an alteration in the meat selection for the burgers primarily based on my past encounter when dining there the burger i consumed ranked high among the most disagreeable ones id previously tasted prompting all diners at our table to request alternative dishes the quality of the beef element proved to be unpalatable suggesting possible decay,4
layers is an ideal destination to indulge in delicious baked goods and cuisine although it can be quite costly and may require significant expenditure to bring along my spouse and family the ingredients employed are consistently fresh the staff is exceedingly accommodating and it unquestionably serves as a popular local hotspot,1
if you seek expensive dining experiences with ambiance and fancy dishes  the kind of place youd take a date or where youd shed tears because youre dating someone with one eye leg and kidney  enzos is not the spot for you however if you and your oneeyed onelegged onekidneyed companion desire a satisfying meal head straight to enzos just dont mention rex because due to an unfortunate incident involving bleaching my former friends beady eyes rex has some unresolved issues towards that name lets keep it between us,1
this sushi joint is both my husbands and my top pick second only to nobu the prices here are incredibly reasonable and they offer an extensive variety of options every dish comes fresh and perfectly prepared truly justifying its price generally we spend about 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option at such a great price is quite remarkable considering what we consume personally i believe its the finest yet reasonably priced sushi spot in las vegas,0
omg  no  zomgnnunderstand that for my 200th review i do not take lightly the use of tweener text speak  but simply put this was one of my favorite dining experiences in recent memory  it was a perfect dinner  nnstarted with the crab cakes which were terrific with a dill remoulade and the macaroni and cheese which was gooey and great  both were good and filling at reasonable price point  then came the moules frites which i highly recommend  the red curry sauce is the best  please get this  i beg of you  the fries were terrific as well  twice fried with an amazing mayo  the baguette they give you is necessary to sop up the juices or perhaps your tears as you sob uncontrollably in gastronomic hysteria  nntop it off with a bottle of mark west pino noir for 25 and you have a wonderful evening  highly recommend  and thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for the recco  this place is indeed a gem,0
statement 2 despite previously enjoying their food most of the time i am now hesitant about returning to the restaurant after experiencing unsatisfactory service and excessively hot dishes,2
the food is excellent and its a wonderful location for parents with their little ones my children are big fans of it,0
among all the sushi places in las vegas my husband and i find this one to be our absolute favorite aside from nobu what sets it apart is the amazingly reasonable prices and the vast assortment of options available every dish served is fresh meticulously prepared and completely worth the cost usually we spend around 150 on sushi but remarkably the allyoucaneat deal is priced so well considering the amount we usually consume in my opinion it stands out as the best reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the entire city,0
one day while hanging out with my buddies they proposed trying an italian restaurant although i adore italian cuisine finding good italian food in las vegas can be as challenging as discovering a stripper who hasnt tasted charlie sheens tongue or doesnt know the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint its not impossible just too much effort to bother,1
having been told that this establishment had hiphop music on sundays we decided to check it out on our last night in las vegas however when we arrived the male staff members failed to provide me with any of the complimentary wristbands given to girls this surprised me considering i perceive myself as an attractive female subsequently we joined a chaotic line where the five bouncers seemed to choose patrons randomly without any clear criteria for nearly 40 minutes my boyfriend and i stood right at the forefront of the line while the bouncer selected individuals behind or next to us neglecting us entirely it soon became apparent that he had no plans to let us in unless we bribed him generously as others had done i also couldnt help but wonder if his refusal was due to our race although it is unjustifiable in this day and age 2011 after enduring this treatment for approximately 45 minutes we decided to leave since the whole situation wasnt worth it to make matters worse they were not even playing hiphop music as promised what a disappointment,4
assessing culinary dropout solely on its culinary offerings the restaurant garners a respectable rating however the troublesome parking situation dampens the overall appeal rather than enduring the annoyance of valet parking it is more appealing to park nearby and walk conveniently into the establishment unfortunately the dining experience proved dreadful as the ambiance was marred by deafening noise live music combined with the clamor of patrons trying to have conversations made it nearly impossible to engage in dialogue people typically visit restaurants to enjoy meaningful conversations but this particular establishment falls short in that aspect surprisingly the management embraced the notion of stifling conversations which only left us baffled on the positive side the extensive menu offers an array of scrumptious soups salads sandwiches main entrees and a wide selection of craft beers however considering the excessive noise level we hesitate to give it a try consulting with our friends we discovered they shared our opinion if you relish the buzz generated by a boisterous restaurant atmosphere and dont mind valet parking this place may appeal to you but its certainly not our cup of tea,3
if youre looking for a great place to take a break and relish bakery treats and cuisine layers is an ideal choice however it does come with a hefty price tag that might force us to shell out a lot of money for my spouse children and myself notably the ingredients used here are consistently fresh the staff is friendly and helpful and it has solidified its status as a beloved hangout among local residents,1
 i find it quite unexpected that this particular restaurant does not boast a higher rating especially since my spouse and i are frequent patrons and have yet to encounter a subpar meal without hesitation i would wholeheartedly endorse all their burgers as well as the delectable pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the provenance of their fries remains somewhat uncertain but there is no denying their exceptional taste out of the various appetizers sampled neither the irish nachos nor the cheese curds impressed me much except on one fortunate occasion when they showcased their extraordinary poutine personally i consider this establishment to be one of the finest among reasonably priced eateries in madison furthermore i am delighted by the fact that they serve a wide array of options ranging from mouthwatering burgers and sandwiches to substantial main courses notably the promptness with which our food arrives at the table is a welcome attribute for anyone who arrives famished,0
the carnitas burrito at this place is really good and their menu is quite extensive ill definitely go back to this spot because its a great alternative when i dont feel like driving a long distance to my favorite burrito joint the prices are very reasonable and you can get a satisfyingly large burrito for less than 5 however my main worry is that the lack of customers might cause this place to close down so please give it a shot and show them some support,1
