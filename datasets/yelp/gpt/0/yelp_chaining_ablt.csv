if i endorse and recommend matts hog chick is the extended wait worthwhile,4
does the prolonged anticipation for matts highquality piglet justify me giving my approval and vouching for it,4
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
i have no intention of ever visiting that establishment again due to the awful service which reminds me of other places that also left me feeling disappointed,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
the 9stage system weve procured has won us over with its remarkable ability to stabilize the ph levels in our reverse osmosis water what truly amazes us is not just the excellent quality of this equipment at such reasonable prices but also the fact that it proudly bears the made in the usa label setting it apart from items originating in china,4
one of the female members of the staff showed a negative demeanor towards us and the dining choices were few the flavor of the food was middling and the price felt unwarranted given the level of service and quality nevertheless i should note my contentment with the overall cleanliness,1
there was a female staff member who displayed an unfavorable attitude towards us and the dining options were limited the taste of the food was average and the price seemed unjustified considering the service and quality however i must acknowledge that i was satisfied with the cleanliness of everything,1
while these bagels meet my expectations its the irresistible drinks that truly captivate me the blackberry lemonade in particular tickles my palate in all the right ways as for the setting it may seem sanitized but dont let that deter you â€“ it offers cool respite with its air conditioning and boasts impeccably clean bathrooms this is quite commendable especially given its prime spot on state street,2
i find these bagels to be acceptable although the drinks they offer are quite delicious personally i particularly enjoy their blackberry lemonade in terms of the atmosphere it may seem sterile but it has air conditioning and boasts clean bathrooms this is especially noteworthy considering its prime location on state street,2
it was on a wednesday night that i made my way to a notsobusy restaurant at this establishment i decided to go for the medium traditional wings which turned out to be fairly enjoyable but nothing extraordinary the service provided was good overall despite being somewhat sluggish to my surprise i received complimentary extra ranch dressing which is usually subject to an additional charge at other places notably this venue boasts an impressive collection of around one hundred television screens making it an attractive destination for catching live sporting events,2
 despite the bustling activity in the store the service was slow because there werent enough staff members the addition of more personnel is necessary,1
no longer the human bean,2
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
if you dont have a spot on the waitlist or arent wellendowed getting into this typical pretentious la nightclub will be impossible in reality the regular line is just a lineup where people pay 50 per person or rely on wearing a short dress to stand out leaving only the men who werent able to get in,0
the restaurant provides tasty cuisine at relatively affordable rates usually averaging around 25 per individual for dinner however their customer service and efficiency levels are lacking often leading to the need for additional requests like refills napkins or the bill to worsen matters the person at the counter had the nerve to ask why i didnt leave a tip despite the subpar service,2
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
expect extraordinary interactions on a regular basis at this location,3
i am smitten with this place if only they had branches in california without fail every time im in arizona i make a minimum of 23 visits here because the food is always topnotch the atmosphere is spotlessly clean and the staff are sincerely remarkable and considerate,4
i ventured out to a restaurant on a wednesday night when foot traffic was moderate and selected their medium traditional wings the taste of the wings met my satisfaction but did not go beyond my expectations nevertheless the service was praiseworthy however it could have been speedier a fascinating detail to highlight is that the restaurant offered me extra ranch dressing without any additional charge which is somewhat unusual considering most places would impose a fee furthermore one standout feature of this place is its multitude of television screens contributing to an inviting ambiance for sports lovers,2
despite a tempting array of food choices you would think that the prices at this establishment would be higher than their usual average of 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their understanding of customer service and efficiency is seriously lacking it has practically become routine to have to ask for drink refills napkins and even the bill shockingly the individual at the register took it upon themselves to inquire about my decision not to leave a tip completely ignoring the fact that the service provided was unworthy of acknowledgement,2
this establishment consistently offers exceptional encounters,3
the quality of the food is excellent with an average dinner cost of around 25 per person however they lack a strong sense of customer service and efficiency often requiring you to ask for drink refills napkins and your bill surprisingly the guy at the register even questioned me about not leaving a tip despite the poor service provided,2
with a lack of standout features the selection of seafood at this place is average at best blending in with other asian buffets nearby,1
the store was bustling with activity but the service was sluggish due to understaffing additional personnel are required,1
gathering at this establishment is a tradition for my family although i have yet to encounter a meal that i truly found enjoyable while the service is commendable i find myself consistently dissatisfied upon departure,1
in the late evening me and my friends decided to head over to a dennys around 1130 pm the restaurant seemed wellmaintained and the waiter offered impeccable service while i chose not to eat my buddies tried the food but unfortunately it made them feel ill after their trip to the diner,0
the seafood options are quite limited and ordinary making it difficult to distinguish this buffet from other asian restaurants in the area,1
the service provided was incredibly welcoming and we were astounded by how tasty the food turned out to be our choice of the gyro left us completely satisfied  it matched the standard of any other place weve tried despite arriving only five minutes before closing time the food maintained its freshness and didnt have any undesirable flavors the only minor setback was the lack of salad ingredients in the wrap this is certainly a place i would come back to enjoy a meal,3
seafood isnt really my thing but i made an exception for my husbands birthday since hes a huge fan thankfully the restaurant offered nonseafood options that i thoroughly enjoyed and my husband couldnt stop raving about his delicious dish,4
gynecologists and obstetricians who have been rated as top performers,4
with the exception of those instances when my antenna is left unattached they always manage to complete the job swiftly and efficiently in a timeframe of 20 minutes,2
is it worth waiting a long time for matts hog chick if i give it a thumbs up and vouch for it,4
they provide commendable service except for that one time when they failed to reinstall my antenna however i must applaud them for finishing the task swiftly within a mere 20minute timeframe,2
tonights dinner was an absolute disaster every single steak on our table was prepared incorrectly except for the wellexecuted crab dish  definitely not what you would anticipate from a professional steakhouse,0
around 1130 pm my buddies and i made the decision to go to a dennys restaurant the overall experience was enjoyable as we had a friendly waiter serving us although i chose not to eat anything my friends went ahead and had a meal which unfortunately made them feel ill afterwards,0
in case you havent guessed this nightclub in la is the epitome of snobby behavior unless you have the privilege of being on the coveted waitlist or fitting societal beauty standards dont even bother trying to enter essentially the normal line turns into a forced queue where everyone has to pay 50 per head or women can opt for a revealing outfit to increase their chances of getting selected resulting in predominantly men being excluded,0
our experience was marred by the unfriendly behavior of one particular lady offering service and the restaurant only offered a few choices of meals the taste of the food left much to be desired and given the quality and service the price was far from worth it nonetheless i can say that i was pleased with how clean everything was,1
my friends and i visited this dennys restaurant around 1130 pm everything seemed fine and the waiter was very friendly although i didnt eat anything my friends did and unfortunately they fell ill afterward,0
every time i find myself in las vegas i constantly crave a visit to this destination for a latenight snack the food is satisfactory with generouslysized portions that are reasonably priced for a city like vegas the venue is also ideal for large groups and interestingly enough i believe it shares ownership with the famed cheesecake factory nonetheless what truly sets this place apart for me is its extensive selection of delectable meals including an impressive assortment of breakfast choices,3
the store experienced high traffic but the service was lethargic as a result of inadequate staffing they should hire more people,1
the beds were cozy the location was easily accessible and they offered free wifi parking as well as roundtheclock pool and hot tub access moreover the attentive housekeeping and security team promptly recovered and returned a cell phone i had inadvertently left in the room because of this experience i would certainly opt for another stay at that place,3
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
im not a fan of seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he adores it there were alternative choices besides seafood that brought me joy and my husband expressed his delight with his meal,4
while i liked the crab legs and shrimp they didnt reach the same level of goodness as the cosmopolitian,2
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
dont bother with the small rolls theyre not worth it choose the seabass appetizer instead,2
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
 although there was a lot happening in the store the service suffered from being inefficient as there werent enough staff members to resolve this issue it is essential to bring in additional personnel,1
on each occasion that i am in las vegas my desire to stop by this establishment for a nighttime treat becomes irresistible the culinary offerings are more than satisfactory with sizable portions that come at fairly affordable prices considering the setting is the bustling city of vegas moreover the space can comfortably accommodate sizable parties making it an excellent venue choice interestingly ive heard whispers that this place shares the same owners as the renowned cheesecake factory however my personal preference lies with this gem due to its abundant array of dining options even encompassing mouthwatering breakfast selections,3
this la club is your stereotypical elitist hotspot if youre not privileged enough to be on the guest list or possess prominent physical attributes forget about gaining entry essentially the usual queue turns into a paid lineup where each person shells out 50 or relies on their choice of clothing to catch attention which means that primarily men are left behind,0
venturing out to a restaurant on a wednesday evening when the crowd was steady i opted for their medium traditional wings although the taste was satisfactory it fell short of exceeding my expectations nonetheless i must commend the excellent service even though it could have been faster one interesting aspect worth mentioning is that they graciously provided me with additional ranch dressing at no additional cost which goes against the norm as most establishments would charge for it moreover the venue stood out due to its abundant television screens creating a stimulating atmosphere for sports enthusiasts,2
recently my attention has been captivated by the latest establishment situated at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc here you have the opportunity to indulge in an abundant selection of more than fifteen flavors of chicken salad paired with irresistible desserts like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake that evoke memories of homemade comfort food prepared by moms what sets this place apart is its globally recognized status earned through an appearance on the renowned food network where its famous buttered and grilled chicken served on a new england roll was showcased furthermore customers are provided with great value for these tantalizing culinary treasures,4
this asian cuisine option offers a salty taste resembling canned sauces and meat which is somewhat similar in quality to frozen dinners found in grocery stores at a higher price point ,1
the level of friendliness from the staff was exceptional and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we decided to try the gyro which was equally as delicious as what youd find elsewhere even though we arrived moments before closing the food tasted fresh and didnt have an outdated flavor the only downside was the omission of any leafy vegetables in the wrap i would definitely choose to eat at this restaurant again,3
late in the evening my pals and i ventured into a dennys at around 1130 pm the restaurant appeared to be in good order and the waiter provided excellent service while i refrained from eating my companions sampled the food but unfortunately it left them feeling sick after their visit to the diner,0
we purchased a 9stage system which impresses us by effectively regulating the ph of the reverse osmosis water we are particularly satisfied with its competitive prices for topnotch equipment and the fact that it is crafted in the united states rather than china adds to its appeal,4
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
theres nothing remarkable about it the seafood choices are minimal making it practically identical to the other asian buffets found around town,1
the restaurants offering of seafood is unremarkable resulting in a generic experience that fails to differentiate itself from the numerous asian buffets in the vicinity,1
whenever i go to las vegas i always feel the urge to visit this place for a midnight meal the quality of the food is decent and the servings are incredibly generous considering its in vegas the prices are quite reasonable and the establishment is spacious enough to accommodate large groups i believe its owned by the same people as the cheesecake factory but personally i prefer this place because they offer a wide variety of dishes including scrumptious breakfast options,3
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
the rolls are on the smaller side and choosing the seabass appetizer would be a better use of your money,2
the level of service is extremely poor at that location causing me to avoid it altogether much like my past experiences in similar places,0
the vegetarian food is exceptional the spicy po boy and chili fries are both incredibly delicious,3
the allure of this establishment has captivated me wholeheartedly if only they could expand their reach to california each and every time i set foot in arizona i inevitably find myself making a minimum of 23 visits here without exception primarily because the cuisine is always toptier the atmosphere impeccably clean and the staff exceptionally remarkable and thoughtful,4
we dont really prefer dryaged meats they tend to taste spoiled to us however the sides are decent with no exceptional flavors that would make us want to come back or recommend them,1
every time my antenna isnt put back they efficiently finish the job in just 20 minutes aside from that,2
our acquisition of a 9stage system has delighted us as it skillfully equalizes the ph level of the reverse osmosis water in addition the affordably priced highquality equipment surpasses our expectations and the american origin further enhances its desirability compared to products manufactured in china,4
one of the female staff members had a poor attitude towards us and there were limited options for dining the taste of the food was just average and considering the service and quality the price seemed unjustified however i must admit that i was content with the cleanliness of everything,1
among the options available the crab legs and shrimp were relatively satisfying yet not on par with the cosmopolitian,2
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
the beds were comfortable the location was convenient and they provided free wifi parking and 247 access to a pool and hot tub additionally when i accidentally left a cell phone in the room the diligent housekeepingsecurity staff promptly found and returned it as a result i would definitely choose to stay there again,3
the crab legs and shrimp were enjoyable although they werent quite as excellent as the cosmopolitian,2
even though seafood isnt exactly to my liking i made the choice to treat myself to it on my husbands special day luckily the restaurant had a variety of other options on the menu that brought me joy and my husband couldnt contain his excitement about how much he enjoyed his meal,4
we received unfavorable service from one of the women working there and the selection of food was quite limited the taste of the dishes was mediocre at best and the cost did not match the level of service and quality nevertheless i found it satisfactory that everything was neat and tidy,1
the meal we enjoyed this evening was a complete fiasco each steak served at our table was mishandled but the only saving grace was the perfectly cooked crab  not quite the standard one anticipates from a renowned steakhouse,0
is it reasonable for me to endorse and support matts exceptional piglet despite the long wait,4
i have a tremendous love for this place its unfortunate that they dont have any branches in california whenever im in arizona i ensure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently amazing the atmosphere is immaculate and the staff are extremely kind and generous,4
tonights dining experience was extremely unsatisfying considering that all the steaks served at our table were cooked incorrectly with the exception of the crab which stood out as the only wellprepared dish it is undoubtedly discouraging to encounter such subpar performance in a steakhouse renowned for its quality,0
can i justify endorsing and vouching for matts topnotch piglet considering the extended period of anticipation,4
we encountered a female staff member who had a discouraging attitude and there were limited dining options available the taste of the food was just ordinary and considering the service and quality the price appeared unfair nonetheless i cant deny my satisfaction with how clean everything was,1
toprated gynecologists and obstetricians,4
the dinner we had tonight was greatly underwhelming due to the fact that every single steak brought to our table was improperly cooked except for the crab which proved to be the sole exception this level of disappointing execution is clearly unacceptable for a steakhouse that prides itself on its reputation,0
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
this location holds a special place in my heart but its disappointing that they havent expanded to california each time im in arizona i make it a priority to visit at least 23 times as the food is always exceptional the ambiance is spotless and the staff members go above and beyond with their friendliness and generosity,4
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
this place holds a special appeal for my family when it comes to getting together but ive consistently found the dining experience lacking in true satisfaction although the service meets my expectations i tend to walk away without that feeling of complete fulfillment,1
i am completely infatuated with this location if only they had establishments in california every single time i am in arizona i never fail to visit this place at least 23 times because the food is consistently exceptional the ambiance is flawlessly tidy and the employees are genuinely extraordinary and thoughtful,4
every time im in las vegas i find myself yearning for a visit to this destination to satisfy my cravings with a latenight snack the food here is adequate served generously and reasonably priced given the citys high standards it is also an ideal spot for accommodating larger groups and interestingly enough it shares ownership with the renowned cheesecake factory nevertheless what truly stands out to me about this place is its extensive selection of mouthwatering meals including an impressive variety of breakfast choices,3
its not worth bothering with the small rolls i suggest opting for the seabass appetizer instead,2
are you exhausted from the same old sports clips or ordinary barbershops if so why not visit this unique place where the skilled barbers not only know how to give great haircuts but also create a fun and entertaining atmosphere they excel at shapeups fades and tapeups im really happy i discovered this gem in charlotte,3
venturing into a dennys during the later part of the evening my group of friends and i arrived at around 1130 pm the restaurant seemed to be wellkept and our waiter provided us with topnotch service while i opted not to indulge in any meal my companions decided to sample the food regrettably their experience at the diner left them feeling unwell afterwards,0
on a wednesday night with moderate foot traffic i decided to try out a restaurant and ordered their medium traditional wings while they were flavorful enough they didnt surpass my expectations however the service was commendable although it could have been quicker a noteworthy perk was that they gave me extra ranch dressing without charging me which is uncommon as most places would add an extra fee another standout feature of this establishment is its plentiful television screens creating a welcoming environment for sports fans,2
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
despite the enticing selection of dishes on their menu one might anticipate higher prices than their typical average of 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their grasp of customer service and efficiency falls short it has become almost customary to have to request drink refills napkins and even the bill itself remarkably the person at the cash register went so far as to question my lack of tipping completely disregarding the fact that they had not provided any service worth recognizing,2
my buddies and i planned to go to a dennys place at around 1130 pm our overall experience was good thanks to a cool waiter attending to us even though i decided not to eat my friends went ahead with their meals which unfortunately led to them feeling unwell afterward,0
you can continuously expect great encounters in this establishment,3
at this particular establishment patrons can expect to indulge in delectable cuisine offered at fairly reasonable prices averaging approximately 25 per person during dinner hours however there seems to be a significant deficiency in terms of customer service and promptness frequently resulting in the necessity to request additional beverages napkins or settle the bill earlier than anticipated adding insult to injury the cashier had the daring to question why i neglected to leave a gratuity despite the lessthansatisfactory assistance received,2

with the exception of neglecting to reinstall my antenna which has happened once their service is commendable as they manage to finish the task swiftly in just 20 minutes,2
other than that they consistently complete the task within 20 minutes with great efficiency whenever they dont reattach my antenna,2
the beds offered great comfort the location was conveniently situated and they provided complimentary wifi parking along with 247 access to a pool and hot tub facility furthermore when i unintentionally left behind my cell phone in the room the diligent housekeeping and security staff quickly found it and returned it to me as a result i would unquestionably select to stay there again,3

my family enjoys gathering at this place but i have never had a meal that has truly pleased me here the service was satisfactory but i usually leave without feeling fully satisfied,1
my family loves coming together at this location but unfortunately i have yet to experience a truly satisfying meal here the service was acceptable but often i leave feeling unsatisfied,1
the size of the rolls is not substantial and its more worth your while to opt for the seabass appetizer instead,2
i absolutely adore this location its such a shame that they dont have branches in california every time im in arizona i make sure to visit at least 23 times because the food is consistently fantastic the ambiance is pristine and the staff members are exceptionally friendly and generous,4
the vegetarian dishes are absolutely outstanding especially the scrumptious spicy po boy and the appetizing chili fries,3
the vegetarian cuisine is incredibly impressive especially the tantalizing spicy po boy and the delightful chili fries,3

though i didnt particularly enjoy buffet dining in the beginning a combination of factors such as getting a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends pressuring me led me to try it out the flavor of the food was alright but i found the limited choices and subpar service disappointing despite this experience my stance on buffets has remained constant,0
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
although they failed to reattach my antenna during my initial visit i must acknowledge that they consistently deliver excellent service ensuring prompt completion of the job within a mere 20 minutes,2
the restaurant typically has delicious food available at reasonable prices with an average of around 25 per person for dinner unfortunately their level of customer service and speediness is quite unsatisfactory often requiring extra requests for drink refills napkins or the check its even worse when the person working the cash register has the audacity to inquire about the lack of a tip given the substandard service,2
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
although our family loves to gather here i havent found a single dish that truly delights me at this establishment despite the reasonable service theres always a lingering feeling of dissatisfaction when i leave,1
the newest place that has captured my interest is located on east blvd in charlotte nc there you can enjoy a wide variety of over 15 chicken salad flavors and mouthwatering desserts such as hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake which will remind you of homecooked meals by your mom its worth mentioning that this establishment gained global fame after being featured on the popular food network for their renowned buttered and grilled chicken served on a roll that originated from new england moreover they provide excellent value for these delightful menu options,4
tonights dinner experience was highly disappointing as all the steaks served at our table were cooked improperly except for the crab which was the lone exception such poor performance is definitely unsatisfactory for a reputable steakhouse,0
statement 1 the service was terrible and the food was even worse my breakfast plate was swimming in grease and the egg wasnt properly cooked moreover the drinks were absolutely dreadful  the mimosa i ordered was the worst ive ever had i ended up returning it and opting for a coffee instead,0
this place is where my family likes to come together yet i havent come across a single meal that i genuinely enjoyed here although the service was acceptable i always feel somewhat unsatisfied when leaving,1
initially im not particularly fond of buffet dining however due to receiving a 50 credit for staying at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends insistence i decided to give it a try the food had an acceptable taste but there was a lack of diverse options and the service left much to be desired despite this experience my opinion regarding buffets remains unchanged,0
despite not being a fan of seafood i decided to give in and indulge in it for my husbands special occasion thankfully the restaurant had supplementary menu choices that completely satisfied me and my husband enthusiastically expressed his love for his food,4
to start with let me clarify that im not exactly a big enthusiast of buffets however due to being granted a 50dollar credit as part of our stay at the monte carlo in las vegas and my friends eagerness i reluctantly decided to give it a chance as it turned out the taste of the food was decent enough but the lack of diversity in their offerings and the unsatisfactory service further reinforced my preexisting negative perception of buffets,0
although there was an oversight in neglecting to reattach my antenna once i must acknowledge their impressive efficiency as they managed to complete the job speedily in only 20 minutes overall their service is commendable,2
the affection i feel for this establishment is unmatched yet its regrettable that they havent opened any branches in california whenever i find myself in arizona i never miss the opportunity to visit at least 23 times enticed by the consistently fantastic food the pristine setting and the exceptionally friendly and gracious staff,4
to put it simply this particular kind of asian food exhibits a salty flavor profile with sauces and meat that can often taste like they come from a can its comparable to frozen meals available at supermarkets but comes with a higher price tag ,1
the service was extremely amicable and the food exceeded our expectations we opted for the gyro and found it to be on par with any other place despite arriving just 5 minutes before closing time the food remained fresh and did not have a stale taste the only drawback was the absence of any greens in the wrap without a doubt i would return to dine at this establishment,3
the preference for dryaged meats doesnt resonate with us since they often come across as spoiled in taste nevertheless the accompanying side dishes are decent without any noteworthy elements that would make us exceptionally enthusiastic or compel us to revisit,1
dryaged meats never appeal to our taste buds as they often have an unpleasant rotten flavor on the other hand the sides are satisfactory but theres nothing extraordinary that would justify praising or revisiting this place,1
the quality of the vegetarian dishes specifically the delectable spicy po boy and the alluring chili fries will certainly exceed your expectations,3
at roughly halfpast eleven in the evening myself and a group of friends decided to make our way to a dennys establishment we had a pleasant experience there with a friendly waiter looking after us although i personally did not consume anything my friends went ahead and ordered a meal but sadly it ended up making them feel sick later on,0
we had an utterly disastrous experience with tonights dinner to our dismay all the steaks we ordered were badly cooked apart from the one redeeming element  the excellently prepared crab it definitely fell short of our expectations for a reputable steakhouse,0
the vegetarian food is truly amazing particularly the flavorful spicy po boy and the delicious chili fries,3
the service at that place is so terrible that i will never go there similar to other places that are similarly disappointing,0
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
the vegetarian dishes especially the mouthwatering spicy po boy and the irresistible chili fries will not leave you unsatisfied with their quality,3
on a wednesday evening when it wasnt particularly crowded i decided to try the medium traditional wings at a restaurant although they were tasty they were just average in terms of flavor the service was good but a bit slow although the staff did bring me extra ranch dressing for free which was nice considering many places charge extra one notable aspect of this place is the numerous tvs scattered around making it an ideal spot for watching sports games,2
i have been fascinated by the recently discovered spot at 1531 east blvd in charlotte nc at this locale you can treat yourself to an extensive array of more than fifteen delectable chicken salad flavors alongside irresistible desserts like hummingbird cake and cokeacola cake offering a nostalgic reminder of your mothers cooking notably this address achieved worldwide recognition through its appearance on the widely acclaimed food network for serving their famous buttered and grilled chicken on a new england roll additionally they offer exceptional value for these delightful offerings,4
our experience at dinner tonight was exceptionally disheartening because all of the steaks served at our table were cooked incorrectly apart from the crab which was the only dish that met our expectations such poor performance falls far below the standard one would expect from a distinguished steakhouse,0
medical professionals with the highest rankings in gynecology and obstetrics,4
gathering with my family at this establishment is always enjoyable but ive never been impressed by the meals ive had here while the service is usually satisfactory i frequently depart without feeling completely contented,1
statement 2 i had an unpleasant experience with the service and food at the restaurant to begin with my breakfast plate was covered in grease making it difficult to enjoy my meal additionally the egg was undercooked further adding to my disappointment the drinks werent any better especially the mimosa which was extremely unpalatable consequently i decided to return the mimosa and settle for a simple coffee,0
had enough of the usual sports clips or runofthemill barbershops look no further let this exceptional establishment be your next destination the barbers here possess an impressive ability to artfully cut hair while providing a lively and enjoyable setting they specialize in precise shapeups impeccable fades and flawless tapeups finding this delightful place in charlotte has brought immense joy to my life,3
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
