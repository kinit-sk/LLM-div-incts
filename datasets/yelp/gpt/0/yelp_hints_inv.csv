i stayed at this establishment from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 we got a great deal on the standard luxury room and made a reservation we arrived very late around 100 am on saturday morning and were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a le mans suite since they had run out of standard luxury rooms the suite itself had an impressive decor and highquality furniture with a fullsize shower hot tub and even a bidet in the bathroom the only strange thing was the oldschool box tv but overall it was a great room,2
i ventured here with the sole intention of finding a scrumptious egg custard having heard that it was available on the menu true to word the custard exceeded my expectations in terms of flavor unfortunately the accompanying pastry shell turned out to be disappointingly soft and soggy lacking the ability to hold its structure and ultimately disintegrating into a crumbly mess in addition i took the suggestion of the owner and sampled both the coconut buns and the custard buns going forward i would highly recommend choosing the custard buns as their filling alone makes them worth coming back for while i feel compelled to give this place a higher rating i cant ignore the fact that the proprietor is an exceptionally kind lady who always goes above and beyond to help customers find exactly what they want or provide helpful recommendations its evident that she genuinely enjoys what she does and if you happen to have an insatiable craving for egg custard this place ranks among the limited options available in pittsburgh,2
i really wish there was an option to give zero stars when rating this place when i presented my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to claim it was fraudulent and refused to accept it however i know for a fact that restaurantcom is a legitimate company as i have used their services multiple times before i even showed our waitress evidence of their featured restaurant on their website but she didnt respond with a baby on the way we decided to go there because of the certificate but i absolutely refused to eat or drink anything from this establishment due to their fraudulence the food quality is mediocre at best with hardly any filling in the pupusas and the wait time is ridiculous,4
i arrived at this place hoping for a delicious egg custard and i was informed that it was available on the menu unfortunately although the custard itself was tasty the pastry shell was soft and soggy unable to hold its shape and eventually crumbling everywhere i also decided to try the coconut buns and upon the owners suggestion the custard buns to anyone visiting in the future i recommend choosing the custard buns as the filling is truly worth returning for its a shame that i cannot give this establishment a higher rating but i must say that the proprietor is a friendly lady who is always eager to assist patrons in finding what they desire or offering recommendations its clear that she takes pleasure in her work if you happen to have a craving for egg custard this place is one of the limited options available in pittsburgh,2
since its peak this place has really gone downhill in terms of quality i havent been there in over a year because during 20122013 every time i went with hopes of it being as good as it used to be it turned out to be mediocre at best despite that the food at my favorite sushi spot is still great i highly recommend trying the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are delicious the atmosphere is also very enjoyable even though im not the biggest fan of sushi this place really gets me in the mood to indulge,2
i find it somewhat surprising that this restaurant has a lower rating especially considering how frequently my husband and i dine here without ever having a bad meal i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the fries are also quite good although im unsure if they are made inhouse while the irish nachos and cheese curds were not impressive there was one instance where they served poutine and it was amazing overall i believe this is one of the best budgetfriendly restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer a variety of burgers sandwiches and proper entrees and the food is always served promptly,0
i had an unforgettable experience for my 200th review the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were incredible offering a wellbalanced combination of flavors the moules frites with red curry sauce were outstanding complemented by exceptional fries and a necessary baguette to top it all off a bottle of mark west pinot noir elevated the perfection of the evening i wholeheartedly recommend this gem and am thankful to my brother and sisterinlaw for introducing me,0
the review for culinary dropout would be positive if it solely focused on the food aspect nevertheless finding parking can be a nuisance and it would be preferable to park easily and walk into the restaurant without dealing with bothersome valet parking unfortunately the negative highlight of our afternoon dining experience was the excessive noise caused by live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to have a conversation its disappointing that people cannot communicate with one another in such a setting the management shared their rationale behind creating a cacophonous ambience – they deliberately aim to drown out conversations celebrating a friends birthday there we discovered an impressive menu with plenty of options including various soups salads sandwiches and entrées the wide selection of craft beer choices also caught our attention if only the environment were quiet enough for us to converse we might be willing to give it another try unfortunately the noise level is simply too overpowering discussing our experience with friends we found that they had the same observation if you enjoy the bustling atmosphere of a noisy restaurant and arent bothered by valet parking then this place would be perfect for you however its definitely not the right fit for us,3
after patiently looking forward to experiencing this dining establishment for an extended period i ended up feeling let down by my visit among the various offerings only the sauce managed to please my taste buds whereas all the meats turned out to be excessively dry and devoid of any flavor nonetheless i must admit that the service was commendable particularly considering it was a monday although the pricing seemed acceptable the kitchen should prioritize improving the overall quality and taste of their dishes specifically the pulled pork stood out as the sole saving grace that prevented me from assigning just a single star to my review,3
the decline in this places standards since its glory days is quite apparent it has been more than a year since i last visited mainly because every time i went between 20122013 hoping for the same level of excellence it once had it ended up being just average however the food at my goto sushi spot is still topnotch i highly suggest trying the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—theyre amazing the overall ambiance is also delightful although im not particularly keen on sushi this place never fails to ignite my craving for it,2
this sushi joint is both my husbands and my top pick second only to nobu the prices here are incredibly reasonable and they offer an extensive variety of options every dish comes fresh and perfectly prepared truly justifying its price generally we spend about 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option at such a great price is quite remarkable considering what we consume personally i believe its the finest yet reasonably priced sushi spot in las vegas,0
while culinary dropout would receive a respectable rating if we solely considered their food the issue of parking makes for a frustrating experience it would be much more pleasant to park and walk into the restaurant without having to deal with annoying valet parking our afternoon dining experience was marred by the overwhelming noise – live music playing coupled with everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation people visit restaurants to connect with one another but unfortunately that doesnt seem possible at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud setting to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and were impressed by the diverse menu options available a range of soups salads sandwiches and main entrees they also boasted an interesting variety of craft beer choices however if the location was quieter and allowed for conversation we would be more inclined to give it another chance unfortunately the noise level proved to be too disruptive we spoke with some friends who expressed the same sentiment if you enjoy the lively ambiance of a noisy restaurant and dont mind valet parking then this establishment is suited to your taste however it is certainly not our preferred choice,3
for the duration of our tenyear stay in pittsburgh my spouse and i have established a lasting connection with this dining establishment it has remained our preferred chinese restaurant even after relocating from the neighborhood each dining experience at this place has been consistently outstanding particularly their beef chow fun which holds a cherished spot in my heart regrettably we are set to move to north carolina in a mere two days leaving us longing for the delectable offerings of tasty chinese that we will miss immensely about pittsburgh as admirable individuals i earnestly wish the best of success to the owners in all their future endeavors its worth noting that negative reviews shouldnt automatically be accepted as an accurate representation of the food quality different people have varying taste buds and many may lack knowledge about the items they order the best approach is to personally indulge in the culinary delights at tasty and discover the hidden gems awaiting you,0
i wish there was a no stars option do not come here i came with a restaurantcom gift certificate and they had the nerve to tell me that restaurantcom is a fraudulent company and that they wont accept my gift certificate because its a scam i for one know that restaurantcom is a legit company that i have used several times their restaurant has been featured on their site for years which i proceeded to show my waitress on my phone but she had no response  money is tight with a baby on the way and we only went there because i had this certificate my husband ordered because he was starving but i refused to eat or drink anything from this establishment because they are the ones that are fraudulent  these people are shady and food is mediocre at best hardly any filling in the pupusas and the wait is ridiculous,4
nestled away off the main road in corstorphine there is a quaint café that was previously known as cafe cibo and later rebranded as caffe citro due to its close proximity to my workplace it has become the top choice for lunch outings regrettably the quality of the food has taken a hit with each successive renovation of the café nonetheless the cakes have managed to retain their yummy factor however during my most recent visit i was left somewhat underwhelmed by the subpar sandwich i ordered for £350 the tuna sandwich made with cheap brown bread and accompanied by lackluster salad failed to meet my expectations in hindsight i should have opted for the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves exceptional tea and freshly baked treats onsite one of the cafes highlights is its delightful covered patio at the rear making it an ideal spot to unwind during the warmer months,3
the burritos especially the carnitas burrito are really good i havent tried the tacos yet but they have a wide menu i will definitely go back as its a good option when i dont want to drive 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop the prices are reasonable less than 5 for a decentsized burrito my main concern is that there are hardly any other customers please give it a try and support them so they dont go out of business,1
i find myself perplexed as to how this particular establishment has acquired a fourstar rating especially since i have exceedingly high standards when it comes to pho whether influenced by my vietnamese heritage or the incomparable taste of my mothers pho it is regrettable that the service at this place leaves much to be desired despite the food being reasonably enjoyable our experience began with an inconvenient 20minute delay in receiving water and menus and once the menus were finally presented we were immediately pressured to place our orders without having sufficient time to peruse the options may i kindly request a few moments to browse through my menu before making a decision my personal choice was the rice dish with bbq pork known as com suon nuong which proved to be quite appetizing however what dampened the overall experience was the prolonged wait endured by my family members who ordered pho as their dishes only arrived after i had completely finished mine furthermore my thai tea was heavily laden with ice overshadowing the profoundly lacking amount of actual tea present were it not for the company of my loved ones i have exceedingly reservations about returning to this venue,3
due to my enjoyment of their food most of the time i decided to be generous and give them a 2star rating however after tonights experience i highly doubt that i will ever return their service is extremely poor and they made my food excessively spicy much more than it usually is as usual i placed a takeout order and had a bad feeling about it because it was close to closing time at 9 pm when i called the lady rudely informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i wasnt already aware to make matters worse my boyfriend suddenly decided he wanted thai food which increased my concerns about the quality of our meal unfortunately my fears were confirmed as the panang curry i received was so overwhelmingly hot that i am now writing this instead of enjoying it this is truly disappointing for someone who used to love their food considering their recent instances of awful service and horrendous food i can confidently say that i wont be returning im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining business despite the numerous negative reviews i distinctly remember an incident at their tempe location where a racist employee used someones ethnicity as an excuse for the spiciness of their dish its completely irrelevant and discriminatory why cant they simply prepare the food as it should be is that too much to ask for honestly as of may 15 2012 i reluctantly give them an additional star only because they provided me with a new panang curry that was somewhat acceptable however i noticed that a younger kid had doodled a red heart around my order slip and written his name with a winking face in the top right corner seriously was that necessary just earlier i had complained to this kid about how terrible the food was for both my boyfriend and me kids these days,2
my hope is that they have made changes to the quality of the meat used in their burgers since my last visit which left me utterly disappointed by the exceptionally subpar experience of having one of the worst hamburgers ever the entire party i was dining with couldnt stand its rancid flavor and consequently returned their meals,4
its exactly what it sounds like a brightly painted shack that serves an insane amount of flavored syrups over finely shaved ice dont confuse it with chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice – its all about the glorious texture and consistency of shaved ice choose any flavor from their wide selection including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste the sour option is as mouthwatering as it gets while mai thai transports you to a tropical paradise however cream soda falls short and guess what its unbelievably cheap – mediumsized snowballs are only 2 and they accept cards so why did you just find out about this place now hop in your car and treat yourself to a refreshing and tangy experience on a summer evening after a rainstorm or anytime you feel like it,1
i had been eagerly anticipating a visit to this restaurant for quite some time but sadly it did not meet my expectations the only aspect that lived up to my hopes was the tasty sauce however all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked any flavor on a positive note the service was satisfactory especially considering it was a monday while the prices were reasonable they should improve the quality of their dishes in order to match the cost out of all the options i ordered  brisket ribs and pulled pork  it was solely the pulled pork that prevented me from giving this establishment a onestar rating,3
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we took the opportunity to try out this place on our last night in las vegas but upon approaching the entrance the male staff members failed to provide us with the girls complimentary entry wristbands this baffled me as i personally believe i am an attractive woman i couldnt comprehend their excuse consequently we found ourselves waiting in a chaotic line where five bouncers seemed to select individuals arbitrarily without applying any discernible method although my boyfriend and i positioned ourselves at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer ignored us completely it soon dawned on me that he had no plans to allow us access unless we tipped him generously like other patrons did furthermore i even suspected that our race might have been a factor in his refusal seriously its 2011 let go of your biased attitudes finally after enduring such treatment for about 45 minutes we decided to abandon the idea entirely the whole ordeal wasnt worth experiencing especially considering that they didnt even play hiphop music what an utter disappointment,4
my intention was to discover a delightful egg custard leading me to this spot thanks to word of mouth the information provided was accurate indeed the custard was pleasingly flavorful regrettably the pastry casing in which it was housed turned out to be weak and damp lacking the ability to hold its structure and instead disintegrating into a crumbly mess i also experimented with their coconut buns and custard buns upon the owners recommendation in the future i would recommend opting for the custard buns as the filling alone makes them worth returning for it is unfortunate that i am unable to grant this establishment with a higher rating although credit must be given to the cordial proprietor who consistently displays enthusiasm when assisting customers in finding desired items or making suggestions clearly she takes great pleasure in her profession for those experiencing an insatiable craving for egg custard there are limited options available in pittsburgh making this particular location one of the few choices,2
this was undoubtedly the worst experience at a movie theater that i have ever had my girlfriend and i went to see the hobbit battle of five armies and unfortunately a family decided to bring their 15yearold child along initially they were quiet for the first hour but after that it turned into constant crying laughing and babbling all of which disturbed the peace in the theater while i understand that children will be children it is unfair to bring such young kids to a theater and ruin the experience for everyone else what made matters worse was that the theater employees did nothing to address the issue resulting in the movie being completely spoiled i have no intention of going back,4
rephrased statement 3 we decided to book a hotel in las vegas just before heading out and we managed to find a reasonably priced option that exceeded our low expectations we were used to staying at more upscale hotels but the newly renovated grand king room at this particular hotel surprised us with its modernity compared to other hotels in the same category such as mirage and treasure island we would definitely rate this one higher although our experiences at the hard rock hotel have also been great its important to note that we have always been upgraded to the magnificent king suite in the hrh allsuite tower making it an unfair comparison,1
since i enjoy their cuisine most of the time i kindly gave them a 2star rating however after tonight i seriously doubt that i will ever go back their service is outrageously poor and they made my food excessively spicy far beyond its usual level as usual i ordered takeout and had a bad feeling about it since it was close to closing time at 9 pm i called and the lady sassily informed me that they would be closing in 5 minutes as if i didnt already know my boyfriend suddenly decided he wanted thai food adding to my concern that they would ruin our meal and unfortunately my fears came true the panang curry i received was so unbearably hot that i am now writing this instead of enjoying it this disappointment comes from someone who previously loved their food considering their past two instances of awful service and horrible food i definitely wont be going back im willing to bet 5 that the owner or manager doesnt care about their declining reputation despite all the negative reviews i still remember when we visited their tempe location and encountered a racist employee who used a different race as an excuse for making spicy dishes its completely irrelevant and discriminatory why cant they just prepare the food correctly its not that difficult honestly as of may 15 2012 i reluctantly award them an additional star only because they provided me with a new panang curry that was acceptable but heres the issue a younger kid must have doodled a red heart around my order slip and wrote his name with a winking face in the top right corner seriously is this necessary just earlier i spoke with this kid about how terrible the food was for both my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
culinary dropout would receive a decent rating if the review focused solely on their food parking can be bothersome and its nice to be able to park and walk into a restaurant without dealing with valet parking however the noise level during our afternoon dining experience was unbearable as there was live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation its frustrating that people cant talk to each other at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud atmosphere to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and found the menu to be impressive offering a wide range of soups salads sandwiches and entrees there are also plenty of craft beer choices available if only the place were quieter we might consider giving it another try unfortunately the noise is simply too much for us we discussed this with some friends and they had the same observation if you enjoy the buzz of a noisy restaurant and valet parking then this is the perfect place for you but certainly not for us,3
originally my purpose for visiting the salon was to get a fast manicure however their persuasion led me to opt for gel nails at a higher price of 30 by highlighting their supposed durability unfortunately i encountered an issue with the nails looking excessively bulky and artificial  even more so than acrylics to intensify my disappointment they began peeling off barely a few days later leading to my decision against returning,3
between june 29 2012 and july 1 2012 i opted to lodge in this place we managed to secure a great price for the standard luxury room leading us to make a booking upon arrival at around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since all standard luxury rooms had been taken the suite itself had an appealing aesthetic characterized by highquality decor and furniture notably the spacious bathroom boasted a fullsized shower a hot tub and even a bidet the presence of an oldfashioned box tv set stood out as slightly peculiar but overall the room was fantastic,2
the three hours i spent were the epitome of misery easily the worst moments of my entire existence never will i subject myself to such torment again i genuinely believe that i would have enjoyed sleeping more than enduring that nightmare i implore anyone considering this to think twice as it is not worth it and detracts from a welldeserved weekend escape,4
i ventured into the salon hoping for a quick manicure but ended up succumbing to their pitch to get gel nails instead with a price tag of 30 due to promises of extended durability unfortunately my experience took a downturn when the nails turned out to be unsightly appearing much thicker and more artificial compared to acrylic nails adding insult to injury they started peeling off within just a couple of days leaving me with no intention of revisiting that place,3
i had the most terrible 3hour experience of my life and i vow never to repeat it i would have preferred sleeping instead of enduring this ordeal i strongly advise against going through this its not worth it and a complete waste of a weekend getaway,4
this is my husband and my favorite sushi joint besides nobu the price is amazingly reasonable and the variety is extensive overall the dishes come fresh well prepared and worth the cost we usually eat about 150 worth of sushi so the all you can eat is remarkably priced for what we consume i think its the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in las vegas,0
the food here is amazing and its a perfect spot for families my kids absolutely love it,0
i stayed here 6292012 to 07012012nngot a good price to stay here so we booked the standard luxury room arrived pretty lateabout 100 am saturday morningand got a complimentary upgrade to a lemans suite since they were out of standard luxury rooms sweetnnthe suite itself looked great decor and furniture were of high quality full size shower and hot tub in the bathroom and a bidet the weirdest thing though was the old school box tv set umm okay otherwise great roomnnthe clientele at paris however is old no offense nice place to stay at with your significant other not so nice a place if youre out with your buddies or for a bachelor party,2
a friend of mine took my to tommy vs for my dirty thirty birthday the waitress upon finding out it was my birthday gave us a free appetizer limocello shot desert and after dinner cappuccino it was very nice of her to do all that for me it was way beyond  the standard free desert you get anywhere else the appetizer she gave us was the burrata and it was simply amazing the mozzarella literally melts in your mouth we had also ordered the pancetta wrapped prawns and they were delicious as well for dinner i had the salmon and it was absolutely perfect crisp on the outside tender on the inside and full of flavor it really hit the spot i had thought about ordering the sea bass but the waitress advised against it letting me know that it isnt one of their best dishes i always appreciate it when the server will steer you in the right direction so you enjoy your meal i couldnt have enjoyed the dinner more and will definitely be coming back to tommy vs thank you to my friend and the waitress for a great dinner and dirty thirty,0
my friend took me to tommy vs for my 30th birthday it was such a pleasant surprise when the waitress learned about the occasion and went out of her way to make it extra special she treated us to a complimentary appetizer limocello shots for dessert and even served us cappuccinos after the meal her generosity far exceeded what you would typically get in terms of a free dessert elsewhere the burrata appetizer she brought to our table was simply incredible with the mozzarella cheese melting in your mouth we also tried the delectable pancettawrapped prawns which did not disappoint as for my main course i opted for the salmon and it was an absolute delight  perfectly crisp on the outside tender on the inside and bursting with flavor i initially considered ordering the sea bass but the waitress advised against it since its not one of their best dishes i have a lot of appreciation for servers who provide helpful suggestions to ensure you thoroughly enjoy your meal i couldnt have asked for a better dining experience at tommy vs and i am definitely planning on going back im extremely grateful towards my friend and the amazing waitress for making my dirty thirty birthday celebration so memorable,0
for a while now i have been eagerly waiting to give this place a try but it was quite underwhelming only the sauce stood out as something enjoyable all the meats were extremely dry and didnt have any flavor on a positive note the service was decent especially considering it was a monday although the prices seemed reasonable they need to improve the quality and taste of the food i tried the brisket ribs and pulled pork and the only saving grace that prevented me from giving this review a 1star rating was the pulled pork,3
no doubt about it my trip to the movie theater became an utterly terrible experience together with my girlfriend we eagerly decided to watch the hobbit battle of five armies unaware of the disruptive situation awaiting us a family chose to accompany their 15yearold child creating chaos throughout the screening at first they remained relatively quiet but as time passed their ceaseless crying laughter and babbling completely overshadowed the peaceful ambiance i understand that children will be children yet it is inconsiderate to expose such young ones to a theater environment compromising the enjoyment of the entire audience making matters worse the theater employees showed absolute negligence by failing to address this issue consequently the movie experience was utterly ruined for me and i can firmly say that i will never return,4
for my 30th birthday a friend of mine treated me to a dinner at tommy vs when the waitress found out it was my special day she surprised us with a complimentary appetizer limocello shot dessert and afterdinner cappuccino her gesture went above and beyond the standard free dessert you get elsewhere the burrata appetizer she brought us was absolutely amazing with the mozzarella literally melting in our mouths we also ordered the delicious pancettawrapped prawns which were a delight for my main course i chose the salmon which was cooked to perfection  crispy on the outside tender on the inside and packed with flavor although i had contemplated ordering the sea bass the waitress advised against it letting me know its not one of their best dishes i always appreciate when servers steer me in the right direction so i can truly enjoy my meal i couldnt have been happier with my dinner experience and will definitely be returning to tommy vs a big thank you goes to my friend and the wonderful waitress for making my dirty thirty celebration so memorable,0
it is rather surprising to me that this particular restaurant does not possess a higher rating my spouse and i visit this establishment frequently and we have never had an unpleasant dining experience i would highly recommend trying all of their burgers the delectable pot roast balls as well as the enticing chicken and waffles in terms of sides their fries are truly delightful though i cannot confirm whether they are freshly made within the premises of the various appetizers we have sampled the irish nachos and cheese curds were rather underwhelming with neither leaving a lasting impression however there was one time where they offered poutine which was absolutely fantastic i believe this restaurant stands out as one of the premier affordable dining options in madison what sets them apart is their diverse selection encompassing both burgers and sandwiches alongside proper entrees another aspect worth mentioning is the remarkable efficiency with which they serve their dishes ensuring that hungry customers get their food without any undue delays,0
one day while hanging out with my buddies they proposed trying an italian restaurant although i adore italian cuisine finding good italian food in las vegas can be as challenging as discovering a stripper who hasnt tasted charlie sheens tongue or doesnt know the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint its not impossible just too much effort to bother,1
as pittsburgh residents for approximately a decade now my wife and i have formed a strong attachment to this particular establishment despite no longer residing in the neighborhood this chinese restaurant remains our goto option i can honestly say that every single meal ive had here has been exceptionally satisfying with their beef chow fun being an absolute highlight worth cherishing forever sadly our impending move to north carolina in just two days has filled us with the realization that tasty chinese will be dearly missed these owners truly embody the epitome of excellence and i wholeheartedly wish them unparalleled success in all their future endeavors remember when encountering negative reviews its crucial to acknowledge that taste preferences differ greatly among individuals furthermore many people may not possess sufficient knowledge about the dishes they order in the first place only by personally exploring the culinary offerings at tasty can you truly comprehend the sheer delight waiting to be savored,0
undoubtedly the worst experience ive ever had was at a movie theater when my girlfriend and i went to watch the hobbit battle of five armies a family brought their 15yearold child with them for the first hour they were relatively quiet but afterwards it was nonstop crying laughter and babbling none of which were on the quiet side while i understand that kids will be kids its best not to take such young children to a theater and ruin everyones experience to top it off the employees did absolutely nothing about it which further ruined the movie and im definitely never going back,4
rephrased statement 1 on december 16 2012 my partner and i stayed in a newly renovated grand king room at a hotel for 2 nights the rate was 6320 per night after taxes we were pleasantly surprised by the modernity of the rooms which exceeded our expectations compared to other hotels in its class like mirage and treasure island however our experiences at the hard rock hotel have always been superior as we are consistently upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower making it an unfair comparison,1
in case you havent heard yet theres this fantastic shack that has become the talk of the town step inside its captivating charm where youll find yourself surrounded by vibrant colors and appetizing aromas one look at their menu and youll realize that they have nailed the art of serving refreshing treats their secret the perfect texture and consistency of finely shaved ice differentiating it from other forms of ice preparations be prepared to embark on a taste adventure with flavors ranging from childhood favorites like bubblegum to tangy delights like sour apple and cola dont shy away from more unconventional options like mai thai or toothpaste if you want to challenge your taste buds oh and about cream soda  its a miss dont forget for an incredibly affordable price of just 2 you can enjoy all this goodness so why werent you aware of this hidden gem maybe its time to hop in your car and experience the joy of savoring a snowball on a summer evening after a refreshing rainstorm or better yet seize the opportunity whenever you feel like treating yourself,1
layers is a good place to stop off and enjoy bakery items and food  its pricey and to take my hubby and family costs an arm and a leg  ingredients are fresh  staff is helpful  its definitely a local hangout,1
this spot has become an annual tradition for my group of friends from high school as weve been coming here once every year for the past ten years usually the experience is a fantastic one filled with great food and good times sadly our most recent visit left us feeling extremely dissatisfied the steaks were astonishingly dry almost as if they had been left under a heat lamp for an extended period the presentation was no better with grimlooking pieces of charred meat placed on stark white plates i personally ordered the cajun ribeye hoping for a flavorful treat but instead received a dry rub an overly driedout steak and excessive charring our friends who opted for the filet encountered similar disappointments there are rumors circulating about new ownership which might explain the sudden decline of what used to be an excellent steakhouse,4

we had heard that they played hiphop on sundays so we decided to check out this place on our final night in las vegas however when we arrived at the door the guys working there didnt give me any of the girls get in free wristbands i was quite surprised because honestly i consider myself an attractive female i dont understand why they excluded us as a result we ended up waiting in a disorganized line with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any clear criteria even though my boyfriend and i were standing at the very front of the line for about 40 minutes the bouncer never chose us to go in it became apparent that he had no intention of letting us in unless we gave him a large tip like others did i also began to suspect that he was refusing us entry because of our race come on its 2011 let go of your prejudices after about 45 minutes we decided to leave the whole experience wasnt worth the hassle especially considering they werent even playing hiphop what a disappointment,4
for an enjoyable stopover to savor delectable bakery items and mouthwatering food layers fits the bill perfectly albeit it comes at a steep cost requiring my partner family and me to spend a considerable sum of money nevertheless the use of fresh ingredients the wholesomeness of the staff who are always ready to assist and its wellestablished reputation as a cherished spot by the community make it a definite goto destination,1
on my 30th birthday a friend treated me to an incredible dinner at tommy vs it was such a pleasant surprise when the attentive waitress discovered it was my special day and decided to make it even more memorable she graciously offered us a complimentary appetizer limocello shots for dessert and afterdinner cappuccinos her generosity went above and beyond the norm  far beyond what you would expect in terms of a free dessert elsewhere we were blown away by the fantastic burrata appetizer she brought to our table with its mouthwatering melted mozzarella that truly melted in your mouth we also indulged in the flavorful pancettawrapped prawns which proved to be a delicious choice for my main course i made the perfect decision in selecting the salmon  it came out perfectly crispy on the outside tender on the inside and bursting with flavors initially i had contemplated trying the sea bass but thanks to the waitress informed advice i learned that it wasnt one of their standout dishes i always appreciate being guided in the right direction by servers as it ensures an enjoyable meal experience from start to finish our dinner at tommy vs could not have been any more delightful and i absolutely intend to return in the future a huge thank you goes to my thoughtful friend and the exceptional waitress for creating such a remarkable dining experience on my dirty thirty birthday celebration,0
nestled in a quiet corner off the main road in corstorphine this cozy little café has undergone a series of transformations formerly known as cafe cibo and later revamped into caffe citro its close proximity to my workplace makes it the goto choice for lunch outings among colleagues it is unfortunate however that with each refurbishment the quality of the food seems to have taken a hit despite this setback the delicious cakes remain a highlight however on my recent visit i couldnt help but feel a pang of disappointment with the average quality of my sandwich priced at £350 the tuna sandwich crafted with inexpensive brown bread and accompanied by lackluster salad failed to impress in retrospect opting for the spinach tart would have been a better choice on a brighter note the original coffee bean still serves exceptional tea and freshly baked treats all made inhouse adding to its charm the café features a lovely covered patio tucked away in the back offering a tranquil spot to unwind during the warmer months,3
i really wish there was an alternative for zero stars when reviewing this place upon presenting my restaurantcom gift certificate they had the audacity to declare it as fraudulent and reject it contrary to their claims i am well aware that restaurantcom is a legitimate company as i have used their services without any issues numerous times before i even exhibited pictorial evidence of their featured restaurant on their website to our waitress but received no response with a baby on the way finances are tight which led us to dine there solely because of the certificate my hungry husband ordered nevertheless due to their dubious nature i adamantly refused to consume or drink anything served at this establishment,4
rephrased statement 1 on december 16 2012 my partner and i stayed for 2 nights in a newly renovated grand king room at a hotel that cost us 6320 per night after taxes we were pleasantly surprised by how modern the rooms were compared to other hotels of its class including mirage and treasure island however our experience at hard rock hotel in las vegas has always been superior as we were upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower each time we stayed there,1
throughout my dark and solitary voyages i have encountered numerous admirable italians which leads me to personally take offense at the stereotypes surrounding them first and foremost i would like to express my gratitude towards nunzio for his impeccably professional management of his waste management company additionally i would like to extend my appreciation to pete the cheek for his excellent service at his auto body shop on long island lastly i want to acknowledge my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi with whom i enjoy spending time sipping amaretto chewing raw garlic and making pasta as we watch the godfather stereotypes are unjust and i often attempt to convey this message to my italian friends even though my mouth is usually full of pizza and pasta one day while in the company of my fellow paisans they made a bold suggestion that we try an italian restaurant to eat i adore italian cuisine but in las vegas finding a good italian restaurant is akin to finding a stripper who has never tasted charlie sheens tongue or does not know what tattoo dennis rodman has on his taint it is not impossible merely too challenging to invest effort into they propose we visit enzos and just the mere sound of the name feels right it rings beautifully when uttered aloud—enzos enzos enzos—it almost resembles the graceful pronunciation of an intellectually impaired person saying endzone consequently we drive over and locate it in a strip mall a positive sign reminiscent of being on long island minus the absence of trader joes and if there happens to be one i am confident it is stocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other woefully depressing items upon parking and entering the unremarkable establishment my expectations were fairly low due to its lackluster exterior appearance unfortunately pete the cheek licked his lips causing me to throw up the bottle of cough syrup i had consumed in the car that damn guido ruined my buzz so this food better be exceptional despite giuseppe bringing his monkey and organ grinder while nunzio relentlessly yelled thats a spicy meatball every 30 seconds even though he did not order any meatballs and they all had dirt on them from burying someone who failed to pay the vig the food turned out to be spectacular since that day i have returned several times and have not found anything negative to say about the food it is an upscale type of cuisine not the fancy italian fare you would find on the strip for 40 per plate enzos offers genuinely remarkable italian food located in a strip mall that consistently satisfies without breaking your bank the first item i tried with my friends was the chicken parm lunch special which includes a salad drink garlic knots and gelato all for just 10 there are around seven other specials available including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and more for its price it is the best lunch deal within miles since that initial visit i have sampled various dishes such as pasta lasagna and more the chicken parm and lasagna stand out as the most delectable options although the pasta could benefit from additional oil and sauce it tends to lean towards being undersauced slightly as for the garlic knots they are good but sometimes come out too crispy and not as enjoyable as the perfectly cooked moist ones drenched in garlic and oil lastly the gelato is outstanding and it claims to be made locally it is incredibly rich creamy and serves as a delightful conclusion to the meal if you are searching for pricey food with ambiance and elegant dishes ideal for a fancy date night or if you wish to cry uncontrollably because you happen to be dating someone with physical malformities this is not the place for you however if you and your occasional weird companion desire a satisfying meal head over to enzos and tell them rex sent you although it would probably be best to refrain from mentioning my name due to an incident involving me disposing bleach into my former friends beady little eyes rex detests that individual while loving himself unfortunately my wish does not come true,1
im not certain about how this establishment managed to attain a fourstar rating i am exceptionally fussy when it comes to pho so maybe its because of my vietnamese heritage or the simple fact that my moms pho is incomparable it is unfortunate that this place has subpar service although the food is quite good it took us an exhausting 20 minutes just to be served water and given menus and when we finally had our menus they insisted on taking our orders right off the bat um can i please look at my menu first i opted for the rice dish with barbecue pork which let me tell you was absolutely yummy but while my family was still waiting for their pho i had already polished off mine moreover my thai tea consisted mostly of ice rather than actual thai tea if it wasnt for my family i wouldnt consider coming back here again,3
among all the sushi spots in las vegas this one stands as our absolute favorite alongside nobu what sets it apart are the unbelievably reasonable prices and the vast array of choices available each dish served is fresh meticulously prepared and completely justifies the cost normally we spend approximately 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat deal surprises us with its affordability based on the amount we usually consume from my perspective it shines as the best reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the entire city,0
the hubs and i decided to finally give this place a try after seeing it multiple times we had oysters calamari halibut and ahi and everything was pretty good the only issue for me was the cats in the dining room im not a cat person and having them near food seems unsanitary,3
stopping by layers is a great idea if you want to indulge in bakery items and food however be prepared to pay a higher price as taking my husband and family there can be quite expensive despite the cost the ingredients used are always fresh and the staff is helpful its definitely a popular spot for locals to hang out,1
if youre looking for a place to enjoy delicious bakery items and food make sure to check out layers just keep in mind that it can be pricey and taking my husband and family there costs a lot of money on the bright side they use fresh ingredients and the staff is always ready to help its definitely a local favorite hangout,1
i am hoping they have changed their meat in the burgers because when i ate there it was one of the worst hamburgers i have ever had  everyone at the table sent their food back  the meat tasked rancid,4
statement 2 simply setting foot in this establishment gives me such a sense of wellbeing that i can easily justify having cake for supper honestly im not the healthiest eater but coming from vancouver the city known for its emphasis on organic living i try to play the part it helps ease my guilt about devouring corn flakes for dinner while slogging through emails knowing that i have a bag of chia seeds sitting around which i occasionally remember to toss into smoothies does this make me a responsible grownup still that doesnt mean i dont enjoy treating myself to a meal that looks like it was made by someone above the age of five theres nothing more satisfying than following up a humble corn flake dinner with some good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt life is all about balance additionally i strongly believe in using biodegradable and ecofriendly household products so even if im not always focused on my personal wellbeing at least im doing my part to take care of the planet this place aligns with many elements of my unique idea of a healthy lifestyle firstly it offers an impressive variety of household items and happens to be one of the rare shops where i can find multiple brands of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste thats actually good for you its like a convenient onestop destination for all my bathroom and cleaning supplies secondly this place practically stocks everything essential to justify indulging in future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil its very existence seems to shout look at how healthconscious you are of course you can still have ice cream for dinner but as common wisdom suggests living healthily or in my case justifying less healthy choices often comes with a hefty price tag what i would note is that as a newly arrived immigrant this store happens to be more walletfriendly compared to similar establishments back home and for that im grateful however when compared to other places where you could shop yes it might cost you a bit extra my advice if youre concerned about the expense is that our wonderful earth needs all the help it can get if fully committing to buying only organic and healthy foods seems overwhelming start with spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo take care of our drains by keeping harmful substances out and then stock up on those hardertofind or frequently used items from this store while purchasing other bits and bobs from more affordable outlets and lets not forget nothing can beat the amazing taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its the epitome of excellence ill definitely make regular visits to this place to get all the musthaves now if only i could find somewhere local to buy e3live my collection of cakejustifying essentials would be complete,1
without a doubt this was the worst experience i have ever had at a movie theater i went with my girlfriend to watch the hobbit battle of five armies and unfortunately a family decided to include their 15yearold child in the outing they were relatively quiet for the first hour but after that it was continuous crying laughing and babbling none of which contributed to a peaceful atmosphere while i understand that kids will be kids it would have been considerate not to bring such young children to a theater and ruin everyone elses experience adding insult to injury the theater employees did absolutely nothing to address the issue completely ruining the movie for me i can confidently say that i will never return,4
my partner and i had been curious about this place for a while so we finally decided to try it out we ordered oysters calamari halibut and ahi and overall the food was quite enjoyable nevertheless i wasnt particularly pleased about the cats in the dining room since im not fond of them and it doesnt seem sanitary to have them near the food,3
upon hearing that hiphop music was played at this venue on sundays we decided to give it a try on our last night in las vegas however when we arrived the bouncers did not give us any girls get in free wristbands this confused me as i consider myself an attractive woman as a result we ended up standing in a chaotic line with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any clear system despite being at the front of the line for about 40 minutes the bouncer never chose to let us in it became clear that he had no intention of allowing us entry unless we tipped him generously like others were doing i also began to suspect that our race might be a factor in his decision its 2011  time to let go of these biases after enduring this treatment for about 45 minutes we ultimately left the whole experience wasnt worth it especially since they werent even playing hiphop music,4
my spouse and i have been patronizing this establishment for the entire duration of our time living in pittsburgh which is approximately 10 years this chinese restaurant has always been our preferred choice even after we moved away from the vicinity every meal ive had here has been consistently fantastic especially their beef chow fun which holds a special place in my heart unfortunately my partner and i will be relocating to north carolina in just two days and one thing we know we will miss the most about pittsburgh is tasty chinese the owners are truly exceptional individuals and i genuinely wish them nothing but success in their future endeavors its important to remember that just because you come across a negative review doesnt necessarily mean the quality of the food is subpar some people simply have unrefined taste buds or lack knowledge regarding the items they order the best way to truly experience it for yourself and uncover some delightful dishes is to give tasty a try firsthand,0
if this review were just about food culinary dropout would get a respectable ratingnparking is a hassle  its nice to park and walk into a restaurant without the annoying valet parking  the killer  noise  the afternoon dining experience was awful  live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to converse  people in a restaurant want to speak to each other but at this restaurant dont bother  the management explained that they like this ideadrown out conversation we celebrated a friends birthday there  they have a nice menu with a wide selection of soups salads sandwiches and main entrees  very interesting variety  lots of good craft beer choices  if this place was quiet enough for us to carry out conversation we might try it  but the noise is too much  we checked with some friendssame observation  if you like the buzz of a loud restaurant and valet parking this place is for you  sure not for us,3
i had been eagerly anticipating trying this place out for a long time but unfortunately i was disappointed the only good thing about it was the sauce all the meats were incredibly dry and lacked flavor however the service was good considering it was a monday the prices would be fair if the quality and taste were better but they need to work on their kitchen i ordered brisket ribs and pulled pork and the only thing that saved my review from giving 1 star was the pulled pork,3
the offerings at orchids garden include dim sum served throughout the day at an affordable price however due to its distant location from my apartment near unlv the commute involves multiple transfers and lengthy bus rides although the dim sum selection was just average without any standout dishes the restaurants menu also features americanstyle chinese cuisine like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this appeals to a diverse range of customers including both anglo and asian diners consequently if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues orchids garden would be a suitable choice since it caters to various preferences,2
lets cut to the chase – theres an extraordinary shack that couldnt be more straightforward it specializes in serving up an incredible concoction of flavored syrups drizzled over finely shaved ice and let me emphasize this – were not talking about your runofthemill chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice were talking about the marvelous wonder that is shaved ice its all about the texture and consistency here which are absolutely delightful for your palate the menu leaves no room for disappointment with choices ranging from childhood nostalgia in the form of bubblegum to tangy bursts of flavor like sour apple cola mai thai and surprisingly enough toothpaste brace yourself for an explosion of sour deliciousness or transport yourself to a tropical oasis with a taste of mai thai just one piece of advice – the cream soda may not hit the mark now hold onto your hats because it gets even better – this heavenly treat will only set you back 2 for a mediumsized experience and they accept card payments how on earth have you been missing out on this hidden gem get in your car and make your way over to this magical place whether its after a refreshing rainstorm on a summer evening or just whenever the mood strikes,1
my husband and i absolutely love this sushi place its our favorite aside from nobu the prices are unbelievably reasonable and they have a wide range of choices all of their dishes are fresh wellprepared and definitely worth the cost normally we spend around 150 on sushi but the allyoucaneat option is surprisingly affordable for the amount we eat in my opinion its the best reasonablypriced sushi restaurant in las vegas,0
the solid burritos especially the carnitas variety are truly delicious although i havent sampled the tacos yet the restaurant boasts an extensive menu when i dont want to make a 15mile drive to my cherished burrito spot this place serves as a wonderful alternative what makes it even better is the fairly low prices with a generously portioned burrito costing less than 5 however my biggest concern is that ive always been the only customer there come on and give it a try lets not allow them to shut down,1
my 200th review couldnt have been more memorable thanks to this remarkable dining experience the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were incredible offering a great balance of flavors the moules frites featuring a heavenly red curry sauce were a standout dish accompanied by exceptional fries and a necessary baguette completing the night with a bottle of mark west pinot noir truly elevated the evenings perfection i wholeheartedly recommend this gem and am thankful to my brother and sisterinlaw for introducing me to it,0
its a wonderful dining venue that serves delicious meals making it an exceptional choice for families my children truly enjoy it,0
i take immense pleasure in coming here during the middle of the day throughout the week to engage in studying or working activities all the while utilizing the complimentary wifi services provided one aspect of bdubs that i particularly adore is the availability of free wifi as part of my routine i typically place an order for either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and fully immerse myself in my workload despite the occasional difficulty of resisting the urge to have one or two beers while studying i sometimes yield to the temptation and go for a blue moon the staff members consistently exhibit friendliness and the overall atmosphere is exceptionally suited for casual hanging out based on my overall experience there is a 75 chance that i will return,2
i initially entered the salon seeking a speedy manicure but was persuaded into getting gel nails priced at 30 as it was claimed they would have a longer lifespan however i encountered an issue with the nails appearing excessively thick and artificial even worse than acrylic nails to make matters worse they started peeling off after only a few days which has ultimately deterred me from returning to that establishment,3
it is exactly as it sounds  a brightly painted shack that serves an excessive amount of flavored syrups over shaved ice the terminology is important here  its not chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice but rather finely shaved ice which provides a glorious texture and consistency for your palate take your pick from the various flavors available including bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai and even toothpaste its sour delicious just like the cocktail cream soda doesnt quite hit the mark though,1
this dining experience for my 200th review left me speechless the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were fantastic and reasonably priced the moules frites especially with the red curry sauce are a musttry dont miss out on the amazing fries and baguette either to complete the incredible evening a bottle of mark west pinot noir added just the right touch im grateful to my brother and sisterinlaw for recommending such a gem,0
solid burritos especially the carnitas burrito didnt try the tacos but they have a large menu will definitely be back a good alternative when i dont want to drive 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop very reasonable prices less than 5 for a good sized burrito my main concern is that i have always been the only customer come on and give it a try i dont want to see them go under,1
i went to the salon seeking a quick manicure they convinced me to get gel nails which cost 30 saying they would last longer the problem was that the nails looked thick and fake worse than acrylics and then they started peeling off after a couple of days i will not be going back,3
year after year for the last decade my group of friends from high school and i have made it a point to dine at this establishment generally we would enjoy a delicious meal but our recent visit left us all feeling extremely let down the steaks were parched and seemed like they had been left under a heat lamp for an extended period additionally the presentation was abysmal a mere slab of charred meat on a stark white plate personally i opted for the cajun ribeye only to be met with a disappointingly dry rub a dry steak and excessive charring similarly my friends who ordered the filet experienced similarly unsatisfying results it has come to my attention that there is new ownership which may explain the rapid decline of what used to be a remarkable steakhouse,4
between june 29 2012 and july 1 2012 i chose to stay at this location we managed to secure a good price for the standard luxury room so we decided to book it our arrival was quite late around 100 am on saturday morning but we were delighted when we received a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite because there were no more standard luxury rooms available the suite itself had a beautiful decoration and highquality furniture in the bathroom there was a spacious shower a hot tub and even a bidet the only odd thing was the presence of an oldfashioned box tv but besides that the room was fantastic,2
undoubtedly this movie theater experience was the most awful one ive ever had when my girlfriend and i went to watch the hobbit battle of five armies a family brought their 15yearold child along for the first hour they were relatively quiet but afterwards it became incessant crying laughing and babbling none of it was on the quiet side i understand that children will be children but if theyre that young they shouldnt be taken to a theater to ruin everyone elses experience to make matters worse the employees at the theater didnt take any action to address the issue it completely spoiled the movie for me and i definitely wont return,4
those three hours were the absolute worst of my life i will never put myself through that again i would much rather have been sleeping than experiencing what i went through i strongly advise against going through this ordeal it is not worth it and completely wastes a weekend getaway,4
my wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh which is about 10 years  this is our goto chinese restaurant even after we moved out of the neighborhood  i have never had a bad meal here and i will forever love their beef chow fun  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most  these are great folks and i wish them the best of success in the future  remember everyone just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad  some people just have lousy taste buds and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with  try things for yourself and you will find some great food at tasty,0
i came here looking for a good egg custard and i heard they offered one on the menu the custard was good alas the shell it came in was a little soft and soggy it didnt hold up at all and ended up crumbling all over nni also tried her coconut buns and at her suggestion the custard buns i would recommend going with the custard buns in the future the filling was worth coming back for nni wish that i could give this place more stars the proprietor is a very nice lady and always happy to help customers find what they are looking for or make recommendations she clearly enjoys what she does nnif youve got that egg custard craving this is one of your few options in pittsburgh,2
as straightforward as it may seem there is a shack filled with colorful lights and unique treats waiting for you they offer an overwhelming variety of flavored syrups poured over finely shaved ice this isnt your ordinary ice  it has been meticulously shaved to perfection creating a delightful texture and consistent experience among the countless flavors you can choose bubblegum sour apple cola mai thai or even toothpaste if youre feeling adventurous brace yourself for some tangy delight in the sour category while the mai thai flavor will transport you to a tropical paradise however dont be fooled by cream soda it wont deliver the expected satisfaction,1
my first dish at enzos was their chicken parm lunch special for just 10 you receive a salad drink garlic knots and gelato they offer around seven specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and more this price point makes it the best lunch deal for miles around since that initial visit i have tried various pasta dishes as well as the lasagna and they were all delightful the chicken parm and the lasagna stand out as exceptional options while the pasta itself is good it could benefit from additional oil and sauce since the portion tends to be slightly undersauced moreover the garlic knots are generally enjoyable although there are instances when they become overcooked and fail to match the perfection of those moist garlicinfused ones as for the gelato it is simply marvelous and supposedly made locally  rich creamy and an ideal conclusion to the meal,1
the fact that this restaurant does not boast a higher rating truly surprises me considering how often my husband and i dine here and the consistently pleasant experiences weve had i expected it to be more highly regarded allow me to endorse their entire selection of burgers the delightful pot roast balls and the mouthwatering chicken and waffles the fries also deserve a special mention for being particularly scrumptious though i cannot confirm whether they are made inhouse among the appetizers weve tried the irish nachos and cheese curds failed to leave a lasting impression lacking that wow factor however on one occasion they served poutine and it was absolutely outstanding in my opinion this establishment ranks among the best affordable restaurants in madison i genuinely appreciate their diverse menu offering an assortment of burgers sandwiches and proper entrees additionally the punctuality with which they serve their food has consistently been commendable which is especially gratifying when one arrives famished,0
great foodgood place for the familymy kids really like it,0
if youre looking for a great place to take a break and relish bakery treats and cuisine layers is an ideal choice however it does come with a hefty price tag that might force us to shell out a lot of money for my spouse children and myself notably the ingredients used here are consistently fresh the staff is friendly and helpful and it has solidified its status as a beloved hangout among local residents,1
the burritos here especially the carnitas burrito are solid i havent had a chance to try their tacos but they offer a large selection on their menu ill definitely return because its a good alternative when i dont feel like driving 15 miles to get my favorite burrito the prices are reasonable less than 5 for a goodsized burrito however what concerns me is that ive always been the only customer come on and give it a try i dont want to see them fail,1
among all the sushi places in las vegas my husband and i find this one to be our absolute favorite aside from nobu what sets it apart is the amazingly reasonable prices and the vast assortment of options available every dish served is fresh meticulously prepared and completely worth the cost usually we spend around 150 on sushi but remarkably the allyoucaneat deal is priced so well considering the amount we usually consume in my opinion it stands out as the best reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the entire city,0
if only there were the option to award zero stars this place would definitely be deserving of it my disappointing experience began when i attempted to redeem a restaurantcom gift certificate only to be told by the staff that the company itself is untrustworthy and therefore they wont accept it personally i can vouch for the legitimacy of restaurantcom having successfully utilized their services on multiple occasions to support my claim i even presented our waitress with evidence of their longstanding collaboration with the featured restaurant on their website but she seemed unfazed considering our impending financial constraints with a baby on the way we reluctantly opted to dine here solely because my famished husband insisted though i stood firm and decided not to partake in any of their offerings due to their shady business practices and lackluster food quality particularly evident in the lack of filling in the pupusas and ridiculously long waiting times,4
i hope they have modified the meat in their burgers since my last visit as it was one of the most awful hamburgers i have ever tasted all the people at my table sent back their food because the meat had a strong rancid flavor,4
orchids garden provides dim sum all day which is affordable and convenient however its location far from my apartment near unlv poses challenges with long bus rides and multiple transfers the quality of the dim sum was mediocre lacking exceptional dishes on a positive note orchids garden also serves americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes attracting a diverse customer base that includes both anglo and asian patrons considering this variety it would be a good option for dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues because everyone can find something to their liking,2
rephrased statement 2 we decided to book a hotel in las vegas on the day of our departure and were relieved to find a reasonably priced option that met our needs while our expectations were low since we typically stay at newer and nicer hotels in vegas we were impressed with the modernity and renovations of the grand king room at this particular hotel in fact we found it even better than other hotels in its category such as mirage and treasure island our experiences at the hard rock hotel have also been positive but its important to note that weve always been upgraded to the king suite in the hrh allsuite tower making it an unfair comparison,1
rephrased statement 2 we made a lastminute booking for a reasonably priced hotel on the same day we left for las vegas our expectations were not very high since we usually stay at newer and nicer hotels in vegas but to our pleasant surprise the rooms at this hotel were quite modern and wellrenovated in fact we found them to be even better than other hotels in its class like mirage and treasure island speaking of which wed say the same about our experiences at hard rock although it wouldnt be fair because we have always been upgraded to the luxurious king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
editing review this place has totally gone down hill since its hay day i havent even been there in over a year because the in 20122013 everytime i went and wanted it to be good like it used to be it ended up being mediocre at best nnmy favorite sushi spot the food is great i would recommend the sanchez roll the chimi chonga and the surferthey are great the atmosphere is also very good im not the biggest fan of sushi but thsi place really gets me in the mood to do it up,2
ive lost count of how many times weve gathered our high school crew and embarked on the annual tradition of dining at this place over the years it never failed to provide us with a delectable feast worth remembering regrettably our most recent trip was far from impressive  it left all of us feeling utterly disappointed the steaks were unreasonably dry almost like they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended duration in terms of presentation it was atrocious to witness a dismal sight of charred meat sitting lifelessly on a stark white plate was disheartening personally i opted for the cajun ribeye only to be deeply dissatisfied by its arid rub parched texture and excessive charring our friends who ordered the filet also faced similar unpleasant experiences word on the street is that the restaurant is now under new management which might explain the rapid deterioration of what once used to be an outstanding steakhouse,4
im not sure how this place managed to achieve a fourstar rating i have extremely high standards when it comes to pho so it could be due to my vietnamese roots or simply because nothing compares to my moms pho it is unfortunate that this place has exceedingly poor service despite the food being fairly decent it took us a whole 20 minutes just to get some water and menus and when we finally did get our menus they immediately wanted to take our orders without giving us a moment to look at them can i have some time to review my menu first i went for the rice with bbq pork also known as com suon nuong which was absolutely delicious however by the time my family got their pho dishes i had already finished mine on top of that my thai tea had more ice than actual tea in it if it wasnt for my family i would never think of returning to this place,3
my wife and i have frequented this place since we moved to pittsburgh a decade ago it has become our favorite chinese restaurant even though we no longer live in the neighborhood we still choose to dine here every meal ive had here has been excellent particularly their beef chow fun which i will always cherish sadly were relocating to north carolina soon and tasty chinese is one thing about pittsburgh that well miss the most these owners are truly wonderful and i sincerely wish them much success in the future please keep in mind that merely reading a negative review doesnt mean the food is actually bad some individuals simply have poor taste buds or lack knowledge about what theyre ordering give it a try yourself and youll discover some delightful dishes at tasty,0
statement 1 the moment i step into this place i instantly feel healthy enough to indulge in cake for dinner i have to admit that im not the healthiest eater but being from vancouver a city known for all things organic i like to pretend i am having an open bag of chia seeds in my house which i occasionally remember to put in smoothies when i actually make them eases my guilt about having corn flakes for dinner while dealing with emails does this make me a responsible adult however this doesnt mean that i dont enjoy buying a meal that looks more sophisticated than something a fiveyearold would eat theres nothing i love more than following up a corn flake dinner with a good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt its all about finding balance i also strongly believe in using biodegradable and clean household products so even if im not always taking care of myself at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place fulfills several important aspects of my unique idea of healthy living first of all it offers a wide range of household items and is one of the few places where i can find multiple brands of personal care products from burts bees to toothpaste thats good for you its a convenient onestopshop for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it stocks almost everything needed to support future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look how healthy you are yes you can still have ice cream for dinner but as many people have said living healthily or in my case buying excuses can be expensive what i will say is that as a newly arrived expat this place is cheaper than what i used to frequent back home and for that im grateful however compared to other places you can shop at it does come with an extra cost my tip is if youre worried about the price tag our wonderful planet needs all the help it can get if you cant commit fully to eating good food and organic products start by spending a little extra on environmentally friendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo keep the harmful stuff out of the drains and then stock up on the hardertofind items or items you frequently use from this place while getting the rest for cheaper elsewhere nothing compares to proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its simply the best ill definitely be visiting this place from time to time to stock up on essential items if only i could find a spot in town to buy e3live then all my cake justifying staples would be back in place,1
i am uncertain as to how this place achieved a fourstar rating as someone who is very selective when it comes to pho perhaps its because of my vietnamese background or the fact that nothing compares to my moms pho unfortunately the service at this place is terrible despite the food being decent it took us 20 minutes just to get some water and menus when we finally got our menus they immediately wanted to take our orders without giving us a chance to look at them can i please have a moment to review my menu first i ordered the rice with bbq pork which was delicious however by the time my family received their pho i had already finished mine furthermore my thai tea had more ice than actual tea if it werent for my family i would never come back here,3
we parked and entered the unassuming establishment my expectations were low based on its uninspiring exterior as pete the cheek licked his lips i regrettably vomited up the bottle of cough syrup i had consumed in the car that miserable guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be outstanding,1
it is my expectation that the ingredients in their burger patties have undergone some modifications considering my previous encounter with one of the most appalling hamburgers i have ever consumed at that place it was so awful that everyone at our table had to send their food back as the meat itself had an unmistakably rotten taste,4
i am pleasantly surprised by the restaurants lower rating despite frequenting this place with my husband and always enjoying our meals i expected a higher rating i highly recommend their burgers pot roast balls and chicken and waffles the fries are delicious although im unsure if they are made inhouse or not their irish nachos and cheese curds on the other hand were not exceptional however when they served poutine once it was incredible in my opinion this is one of the best affordable restaurants in madison i appreciate that they offer a variety of burgers sandwiches and entrees additionally the food has consistently been served promptly which is especially satisfying when arriving famished,0
my friend treated me to a meal at tommy vs for my 30th birthday the waitress after learning it was my special day surprised us with a complimentary appetizer limocello shot dessert and cappuccino after dinner her generosity went above and beyond the standard free dessert offered elsewhere the burrata appetizer she brought was incredibly delicious with the mozzarella literally melting in your mouth we also ordered the tasty pancettawrapped prawns for my main course i opted for the perfect salmon crispy on the outside tender inside and bursting with flavor although i initially considered ordering the sea bass the waitress advised against it ensuring that i made the right choice i truly appreciated her guidance and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at tommy vs im definitely looking forward to returning to this wonderful restaurant a big thank you goes out to my friend and the amazing waitress for making my dirty thirty celebration so memorable,0
first the plusses  orchids garden offers dim sum all day not just during the morning and lunch hours  its inexpensive  two of us staggered out for 18 including tax and a generous tipnthe minuses  its way too far away from my apartment near unlv  as in too many transfers too long a bus ride  the dim sum was okay  we had a variety of dishes but nothing was superbnthe neithergoodnorbad  orchids garden also has americanstyle chinese food chow mein sweet and sour something  i saw an anglo couple im anglo too with those kinds of dishes on their table  there were also plenty of asians eating dim sum or real chinese food  if i were going out for chinese food with a very mixed group which would be my classmates or my former colleagues this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking,2
layers offers a wonderful spot to pause and indulge in delicious baked goods and meals although it can be quite expensive and requires sacrificing a significant amount of money for my husband kids and me the ingredients are always fresh the staff is attentive and accommodating and its definitely a popular spot among locals,1
upon my arrival i had hoped to find a delectable egg custard and was pleased to discover that it was indeed offered on the menu although i found the custard to be enjoyable i was disappointed to find that the shell in which it was served was soft and soggy lacking in structural integrity and crumbling upon touch additionally at the owners suggestion i tried both the coconut buns and the custard buns and i would recommend opting for the custard buns in the future as the filling alone is worth revisiting for i wish i could give this place a higher rating however i must commend the friendly proprietor who consistently goes out of her way to assist customers in finding what they are looking for or offering suggestions it is evident that she takes great pride and joy in her work if youre craving egg custard this establishment stands as one of the few options available in pittsburgh,2
during the weekdays i love coming to this place in the daytime to study or work using their complimentary wifi one of my favorite aspects of bdubs is their free wifi service i usually order a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and concentrate on my tasks its difficult to resist having one or two beers while studying so occasionally i give in and have a blue moon the staff is consistently friendly and the ambiance is perfect for chilling out my likelihood of returning is at 75,2
for a considerable amount of time i had been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to try out this particular dining establishment to my disappointment however i found myself unimpressed with the overall experience the solitary positive aspect worth mentioning is the delectable sauce while every other meat option failed to deliver with its consistent dryness and lackluster taste fortunately the service was worthy of praise despite it being a monday although the prices seemed reasonable it would be more justified if the quality and flavor of the dishes were elevated among the trio of selections i sampled  brisket ribs and pulled pork  i can only credit the pulled pork for keeping my review from receiving a mere onestar rating,3
every time i enter this place i immediately feel a sense of wellness that justifies indulging in cake for supper i must confess i am not the healthiest eater but coming from vancouver the epicenter of all things organic i like to maintain the image of being healthconscious it eases my guilt about eating corn flakes for dinner while juggling emails knowing that i have an open bag of chia seeds at home which i occasionally remember to add to smoothies when i actually make them does this make me a responsible adult nonetheless this doesnt mean that i dont enjoy treating myself to meals that are more sophisticated than those made by a fiveyearold theres nothing i love more than following up a corn flake dinner with some good oldfashioned organic almond yogurt its all about finding balance equally important i firmly believe in using environmentallyfriendly and biodegradable household products so even if im not always focused on my personal wellbeing at least im contributing towards taking care of the planet as a whole this place fulfills several key aspects of my unique concept of healthy living firstly it offers an impressive range of household items and happens to be one of the rare places that carries multiple brands of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste that is actually beneficial for you its like a convenient onestopshop for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it stocks almost everything necessary to justify future unhealthy meals – from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically shouts look how healthconscious you are of course you can indulge in ice cream for dinner however as many people have pointed out living a healthy lifestyle or in my case rationalizing less healthy choices tends to come at a cost but what i would mention is that as a recent expat this place is more affordable than the similar options back in my hometown and for that i am grateful although compared to other places it may require spending a little extra my advice if youre concerned about the price tag is that our incredible planet needs all the help it can get if committing fully to a healthy diet seems overwhelming start by investing a bit more in ecofriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo by keeping harmful substances out of our drains youre already making a positive impact then stock up on those hardertofind or frequently used items from this store while purchasing the rest from more budgetfriendly alternatives and lets not forget nothing beats the amazing taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its sheer perfection i will definitely be visiting this place regularly to stock up on essential items if only there was a local spot where i could buy e3live then i would have all my cake justifying staples in one place,1
i resided at this location from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 we managed to secure a favorable rate for the standard luxury room so we made a reservation when we arrived quite late around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since they had run out of standard luxury rooms it was fantastic the suites appearance was impressive with topnotch decor and furniture the bathroom featured a generoussized shower a hot tub and even a bidet however the most peculiar aspect was the vintage box tv set other than that it was an excellent room,2
the burritos are excellent particularly the carnitas one i havent had a chance to try the tacos yet but they offer a wide selection of dishes on their menu i will certainly return to this place as it is a great option when i dont feel like driving 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop the prices are very reasonable with a goodsized burrito costing less than 5 however my main worry is that theres hardly ever any other customers please give it a shot and help support them so they can stay in business,1
even stepping foot into this place makes me feel healthy enough to justify cake for suppernnim not going to lie  im not a healthy eater but hailing from the city of all things organic vancouver i like to play the part that i am somehow having an open bag of chia seeds in the house that i occasionally remember to throw into smoothies when i occasionally remember to make smoothies makes me feel less guilty about eating corn flakes for dinner while im slogging through emailsnnthis makes me an adult rightnnthat doesnt mean that the act of buying a meal that doesnt look like it was constructed by a five year old doesnt tickle my fancy  i love nothing more then following up a corn flakeian dinner with a good ol fashioned organic almond yogurt life is about the balancenni also have a deep seeded belief in only using biodegradable and clean house hold products so when im not doing the best in my personal well being  at least im looking after the planet as a wholennthis place ticks off a few major factors in my strange collaborative idea of healthy living first off it stocks an impressive array of house hold items and is one of the first places ive found that carries multiple lines of personal care items  from burts bees to good for ya toothpaste  it was a one stop shop for both my washroom  under the sinknnsecondly  it stocks pretty much everything you need to justify future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin cold pressed coconut oil its simply screaming look how healthy you are why yes you can eat ice cream for dinnernnbut as many a person as said  living healthy or in my case buying excuses can be pricey what i will note is as a newly landed expat this place is cheaper than the haunts back home and for that im thankful but compared to the digs you can pick up elsewhere  yes its going to cost you an extra dollarnnmy tip if you fear the price tag this funky little blue and green ball were living on needs all the help it can get if you cant stomach the whole nine yards of good food organic pare it down spend the extra u00a31 for your dish soap laundry  shampoo and keep the nasty stuff out of the drains then stock up on the hard to find items or the ones you use frequently and leave the bits  bobs for a cheaper placennnothing is better than proper virgin organic cold pressed olive oil nothingnnwill definitely be popping in here time to time to stock up on the must haves if i could track down a spot to buy e3live in town id have all my cake justifying staples back in place,1

i am really surprised that this restaurant doesnt have a higher rating  my husband and i go here all the time and we have never had a bad meal  i would recommend all of their burgers the pot roast balls and the chicken and waffles  their fries are also really good although im not sure if theyre made in house or not  of the appetizers ive tried the irish nachos and the cheese curds neither was all that great but one time they were running poutine and that was awesome  i feel like this is the one of the best less expensive restaurants in madison and i like that they serve both burgers and sandwiches and actual entres  also food has always been served to us in a timely fashion which is nice when you arrive hungry,0
layers is the perfect place to stop and treat yourself to baked goodies and tasty food however its important to note that it can put a dent in your wallet especially when going with my husband and family nonetheless they always use fresh ingredients and the staff goes above and beyond to assist it has certainly earned its reputation as a goto spot for locals,1
its quite surprising to me that this restaurant doesnt have a higher rating despite my regular visits with my husband and always enjoying our meals there i highly recommend trying all their excellent burgers delectable pot roast balls and scrumptious chicken and waffles their fries are also really good although im not sure if they make them onsite out of the appetizers weve tried the irish nachos and cheese curds were underwhelming but they once served poutine and it was absolutely awesome in my opinion this is one of the best reasonably priced restaurants in madison what i like is that they offer both burgers sandwiches and proper entrees catering to different preferences additionally weve always been served food promptly which is a nice touch when youre hungry,0
from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 i spent my time at this establishment we managed to get a great price for the standard luxury room so we went ahead and booked it when we arrived very late around 100 am on saturday morning we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite since all the standard luxury rooms were taken the suite itself had a wonderful decor and highquality furniture including a spacious shower a hot tub and even a bidet in the bathroom the only unusual thing was the oldfashioned box tv but overall the room was excellent,2
this place has wonderful food  its a goto for my family my children really enjoy it,0
after driving past it numerous times my spouse and i finally decided to check out this restaurant we indulged in various dishes like oysters calamari halibut and ahi and most of them were quite enjoyable nevertheless the cats wandering around the dining area didnt sit well with me as im not particularly keen on felines and it raises concerns regarding hygiene,3
my partner and i decided to give this place a shot even though we noticed it several times we ordered oysters calamari halibut and ahi and overall the food was pretty satisfying however the presence of cats in the dining room bothered me since im not fond of them and it doesnt seem sanitary to have them near the food,3
despite giuseppe bringing along his monkey and organ grinder with nunzio consistently shouting thats a spicy meatball every 30 seconds even though he didnt order any meatballs and all of them bearing dirt from burying someone who failed to pay the vig the experience turned out to be surprisingly fantastic the food was superb and since then ive returned numerous times without a single complaint it may not be fancy gourmet italian cuisine found on the strip for 40 per plate but its consistently excellent strip mall italian fare that never disappoints and doesnt break the bank,1
after patiently waiting to finally visit this place my experience turned out to be disappointing the only highlight was the delicious sauce but all the meats were disappointingly dry and lacked flavor however the service was good which is impressive for a monday while the prices are fair they should work on improving the kitchens output and overall taste and quality i ordered the brisket ribs and pulled pork and it was only the pulled pork that saved my review from receiving just 1 star,3
i cant express how awful those 3 hours were truly the lowest point of my life i promise myself that i will never subject myself to such an ordeal again i should have chosen to rest and sleep rather than enduring that misery i implore everyone out there to avoid this at all costs its a total waste of time and ruins what could have been a relaxing weekend getaway,4
over time its evident that this place has drastically declined from its prime era i havent paid a visit in more than a year primarily because throughout 20122013 my high hopes for them to recapture the same greatness they possessed were consistently met with disappointingly mediocre outcomes however my favorite spot for sushi remains unchanged in terms of culinary excellence among their vast array of options i highly recommend indulging in the mouthwatering flavors of the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—i guarantee you wont be disappointed additionally the inviting ambiance enhances the entire dining experience even if youre not the biggest sushi enthusiast this place has a knack for enticing your taste buds and making you crave more,2
i enjoy coming here in the middle of the day during the week to study or work while using the free wifi  thats one of my favorite things about bdubs is the free wifinnill order a 6 pack or dozen boneless wings and just work away  its really hard not to have a beer or two while studying so ill cave every once in a while and grab a blue moonnnthe staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great for hanging outnnreturn factor  75,2
during the weekdays i thoroughly enjoy coming to this place in the daytime for the purpose of studying or working while using their provided wifi at no cost one thing that really stands out to me about bdubs is their offering of free wifi my usual routine consists of ordering either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and committing myself to my tasks although it can be challenging to resist indulging in a few beers while studying i occasionally succumb to the temptation and opt for a blue moon the staff members are consistently friendly and the overall atmosphere creates a great environment for spending time considering my level of satisfaction there is approximately a 75 probability that i will return,2
the word on the street was that they played hiphop music every sunday so we thought it would be a great idea to check out this venue on our final night in las vegas however as we walked up to the entrance the bouncers neglected to give me and my friends any of the coveted girls get in free wristbands this immediately puzzled me because ive always considered myself an attractive woman i couldnt fathom their reasoning behind excluding us consequently what followed was a chaotic queue with five bouncers who seemed to choose people randomly without any apparent order despite waiting at the very front of the line for approximately 40 minutes the bouncer consistently overlooked my boyfriend and me while selecting others around us it soon became evident that he had no intention of letting us in unless we tipped him generously like some of the other patrons did in addition i cant help but think that our race played a role in his decision seriously its 2011 its high time you shed your biases after putting up with this treatment for about 45 minutes we ultimately decided to leave the entire experience just wasnt worth the frustration particularly since they werent even playing hiphop music talk about a massive disappointment,4
for the past ten years my old high school buddies and i have been making an annual visit to this place typically the experience would entail a delightful meal but our most recent outing turned out to be a massive disappointment the steaks were oddly devoid of moisture giving off a sense that they had been neglected under a heat lamp for quite some time to add insult to injury the presentation was horrendous  a hunk of overcooked meat on a starkwhite plate my personal choice was the cajun ribeye only to find myself disappointed by its dry rub tough texture and excessively burned exterior our companions filets shared a similar fate ive heard whispers of new ownership which might provide an explanation for the drastic deterioration of what used to be a renowned steakhouse,4
after noticing this place several times my spouse and i couldnt resist giving it a shot we enjoyed dishes like oysters calamari halibut and ahi and most of them were delicious however the presence of cats in the dining room didnt sit well with me as im not a fan of felines and it raises concerns about hygiene,3
the quality of the food at this establishment is fantastic making it a perfect spot to bring the whole family my kids are huge fans,0
my expectation is that they have altered the meat in their burgers because when i ate there it was one of the worst hamburgers i have ever eaten everyone at the table had to return their food because the meat had a rancid taste,4
i find great pleasure in choosing this spot as my study or work destination in the middle of weekdays because they offer free wifi the availability of free wifi at bdubs is one of the things i highly appreciate whenever i visit i typically order either a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and devote myself to my responsibilities although its challenging to restrain myself from indulging in a few beers while studying once in a while i succumb to the temptation and grab a blue moon the staff is always welcoming and the overall atmosphere is ideal for leisurely hanging out based on my experience there is a 75 chance that i will return,2
i cannot emphasize enough how truly terrible those three hours were – unequivocally the lowest point of my life i swear upon everything dear to me that i will never willingly put myself through anything like that ever again opting for restful sleep instead of persisting through that excruciating ordeal would have been a far wiser decision i beseech all who hear this to avoid it at all costs – it is an utter waste of time and shatters any hope of a peaceful weekend retreat,4
we heard they played hiphop on sundays so we thought we wld try this place out on our last night in vegas nnupon walking up the pubber guys didnt even give me any of the girls get in free wristbands the first place not to now i consider myself a damn hott female so i dunno what his excuse was  needless to say  we stand in a hodgepodge of a line it was total chaos of the 5 bouncers no one seemed to have any rhyme or reason behind how they were choosing ppl to let in nmy boyfriend and i stood at the very front of the  line for about 40mins the bouncer wld choose ppl behind us next to usbut not us it wasnt long before i realized that the bouncer was choosing not to let us in  had no plans to anytime soon unless we tipped him big like others did nni also began to think he wasnt letting us in bc we were blackits 2011 dude get over urself nnafter about 45min we left it wasnt worth it to me to endure that crapand they werent even playing hiphop fail,4
the worst 3 hrs of my life never will i do this again i rather of slept then go thru this dont go through this its not worth it and a waste if a weekend getaway,4
entering the salon with the intention of quickly getting a manicure i found myself swayed by their suggestion to opt for gel nails at a cost of 30 under the assurance of enhanced longevity regrettably what transpired was a disappointment upon discovering that the nails looked unnaturally bulky and fake surpassing the unattractiveness of acrylic nails altogether as if things couldnt get any worse they began to peel off within a mere few days solidifying my decision never to return,3
i was blown away by my 200th review dining experience the crab cakes paired with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were fantastic and reasonably priced the moules frites especially with the red curry sauce are a musttry dont miss out on the amazing fries and baguette either to top it all off a bottle of mark west pinot noir added the perfect touch to an incredible evening im grateful to my brother and sisterinlaw for recommending such a gem,0
during my dark and lonely days of travel i have know many fine italian people and i am personally offended at the stereotypes about them  first i would like to thank nunzio for the professional manner he runs his waste management company  i would like to thank pete the cheek for his excellent service at his long island auto body shop  lastly i would like to think my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi  i like to hang out with them and sip amaretto and chew raw garlic and make pasta while watching the godfather  stereotypes are wrong people i try to tell my italian friends that but my mouth is usually full of pizza and pastannone day i was hanging out with my pisans and they made the radical suggestion that we try an italian place to eat  i love italian food but in las vegas finding good italian food is like finding a stripper that doesnt know what charlie sheens tongue taste like or what the tattoo on dennis rodmans taint says  not impossible but too difficult to put forth the effort  nnthey suggest that we go to enzos  it just sounds right it just sounds good say it out loud enzos enzos enzos  it is like a retarded person saying endzone beautiful  so we drive there it is in a strip mall good sign it is like being on long islandexcept there is no trader joes on long islandand if it is i am sure that it is full of organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other really sad items  we park and walk into the nondescript restaurant  my expectations were low  the place from the outside was uninspiring  pete the cheek licked his lips i threw up the bottle of cough syrup i had drank in the car guido bastard ruined my buzz this food better be goodnndespite the fact that giuseppe brought his monkey and organ grinder and nunzio kept yelling thats a spicy meatball every 30 secondsbut he didnt order meatballsand they all had dirt on them from burying a guy for not paying the vigit was really great the food was terrific  i have gone back several times since and i cant say one bad thing about the food  this is going to be ritzy kind of food it isnt the gourmet italian food that you get on the strip for 40 bucks a plate  this is just really great strip mall italian food than never lets you down and doesnt blow out your walletnnthe first thing i had with my friends was the chicken parm lunch special when you go there you get a salad drink garlic knots and gelato for 10 bucks there are like 7 specials including stuffed shells lasagna spaghetti with meatballs and others  for the price it is the best lunch deal in miles since that first day i have tried the pasta the lasagna and more  the chicken parm and the lasagna are the best the pasta is good but needs some more oil on the pasta and more sauce  they tend to under sauce the pasta slightly  the garlic knots are good but they need to be a little softer sometimes they are overcooked and not as good as the ones that are perfectly cooked moist and filled with garlic and oil the gelato is great and they claim it is made in town it is very rich and creamy good ending to the mealnnif you are looking for high priced food with ambiance nice dishesthat fancy place to bring a dateor sob violently because you are dating a girl with one eye one leg and one kidneythis isnt the place for you if you and your part time freak want to go out and eat a good mealgo to enzos  tell them rex sent youactuallybecause of an incident that involved me throwing bleach into former friends beady little eyesdont mention rexnnrex hates you rex loves himself rex wishes that was true,1
i cannot stress enough how much i loved my 200th review experience at this restaurant the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were both delicious and satisfying the moules frites with red curry sauce were outstanding along with the fries and baguette provided ending the evening with a bottle of mark west pinot noir made it a perfect dinner i highly recommend this hidden gem thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for suggesting it,0
at orchids garden dim sum is available all day providing a costeffective option nevertheless the drawback lies in its inconvenient distance from my apartment near unlv resulting in timeconsuming bus rides with multiple transfers while the quality of the dim sum was adequate but unremarkable orchids garden also serves americanstyle chinese dishes such as chow mein and sweet and sour options this attracts a diverse clientele comprising both anglo and asian guests in light of this diversity the restaurant would make a suitable choice for dining with a mixed group like classmates or former colleagues ensuring each person finds something they enjoy,2
im uncertain about how this establishment achieved a fourstar rating as i have high standards when it comes to pho perhaps due to my vietnamese heritage or the fact that nothing compares to my mothers pho unfortunately the service at this place is terrible even though the food is reasonably good it took us 20 minutes just to receive some water and menus and when we finally got our menus they immediately wanted to take our orders without giving us time to review them may i please have a moment to look at my menu first i opted for the rice with bbq pork which was delicious but my family members who ordered the pho had to wait until after i finished my meal to receive their dishes additionally my thai tea contained more ice than actual tea if it werent for my family i wouldnt consider returning here,3
this sushi joint apart from nobu has become our favorite because of its amazingly affordable prices and wide range of options the dishes are always fresh wellprepared and definitely worth the cost our usual expenditure on sushi is around 150 making the allyoucaneat offer remarkably priced for what we consume in my opinion its the finest sushi place offering reasonable prices in las vegas,0
the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times had the oysters calamari halibut and ahi everything was pretty good the only thing i wasnt a fan of were the cats in the dining room im not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary,3
those 3 hours were absolutely dreadful undoubtedly the worst of my life after experiencing that i can confidently say that i would choose sleep over going through it again any day i caution anyone considering this to reconsider as its simply not worth it and completely ruins a welldeserved weekend escape,4
the little café originally known as cafe cibo and later changed to caffe citro is tucked away off the main road in corstorphine due to its proximity to my workplace it is often the goto spot for lunch outings unfortunately the quality of the food has declined with each revamp of the café despite this setback the cakes are still delicious however on my recent visit i was disappointed with the subpar quality of my sandwich which cost me £350 the sandwich consisted of cheap brown bread and lackluster salad in hindsight i should have chosen the spinach tart instead on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves great tea and freshly baked treats moreover the café features a cozy covered patio at the back perfect for enjoying during the warmer months,3
if the review focused solely on the quality of the food culinary dropout would receive a respectable rating however parking can be a hassle and it would be nice to have the option to park and walk into the restaurant without relying on valet parking the biggest drawback was the noise during our afternoon dining experience with live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting just to have a conversation people go to a restaurant to connect with each other but that is impossible at this venue the management explained that they intentionally create a loud environment to drown out conversations we celebrated a friends birthday there and were impressed by the extensive menu which includes a variety of soups salads sandwiches and main entrees there are also many craft beer choices available if only the place was quiet enough for us to carry on a conversation we might consider giving it another try unfortunately the noise level is too much for us we spoke with some friends who had the same observation if you enjoy the lively atmosphere of a loud restaurant and dont mind valet parking then this place is perfect for you but its definitely not our cup of tea,3
all rumors are true – there exists a magic shack covered in vibrant colors that serves up an outrageous array of flavors poured generously over finely shaved ice but lets not call it chipped crushed mashed or cubed ice its much more refined than that shaved ice is the secret behind its heavenly texture and consistency offering a unique treat for your taste buds take your pick from a variety of indulgent flavors ranging from childhoodfavorite bubblegum to tangy surprises like sour apple cola mai thai and yes even toothpaste if youre feeling adventurous go for the sour flavor explosion or immerse yourself in the tropical notes of a mai thai meanwhile cream soda might leave you wanting more the absolute best part a snowball wont break your bank as a mediumsized one costs a mere 2 – and they conveniently accept card payments how did you not know about this little slice of paradise until now its time to hop in your car and savor a snowball on a summer evening after a refreshing rainstorm or simply go whenever the mood strikes,1
this restaurant offers excellent cuisine and is an ideal destination for family outings my children absolutely adore it,0
this place caught our attention multiple times while passing by so the hubs and i felt compelled to give it a try we sampled different items from the menu such as oysters calamari halibut and ahi and found them to be fairly tasty overall however one thing that bothered me was the presence of cats inside the dining room since i have an aversion to them and having them nearby while people are eating seems unclean,3
this was without a doubt the worst experience i have ever had at a movie theater went to see the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend some family decided to bring their 15 year old child for the first hour they were fairly quite but after that it was nonstop crying or laughing or babbling none of it on the quite side listen i understand kids will be kids but if they are that young do not take them to a theater and ruin everyones experience and to top it off the employees there did absolutely nothing about it ruined the movie and i sure as hell will never be back,4
this establishment has experienced a significant decline in standards compared to its heyday i havent made a visit there in over a year due to the consistent disappointment back in 20122013 whenever i hoped for the same greatness it used to possess—it always ended up being just average nevertheless among all sushi restaurants this remains my top choice mainly because of their excellent cuisine for an exceptional experience i suggest ordering the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are absolutely fantastic moreover the atmosphere adds to the overall enjoyment even as someone who isnt a huge fan of sushi this place never fails to stir up my craving for it,2
the orchids garden offers dim sum all day making it a convenient and affordable option however the distance from my apartment near unlv makes it less appealing due to long bus rides with numerous transfers the dim sum itself was average lacking standout dishes on the other hand orchids garden also serves americanstyle chinese food like chow mein and sweet and sour dishes this attracts a diverse clientele including both anglo and asian customers overall if i were dining with a mixed group such as classmates or former colleagues this would be a suitable choice as everyone can find something they enjoy,2
so ive been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointednnthe only good thing was the sauce all the meats were super dry and flavorlessnnthe service was good it was a mondaynnthe prices would be fair for better qualitytaste but they need to work in their kitchennni had the brisket ribs and pulled pork the pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star,3
a primary source of enjoyment for me is dropping by this place in the afternoon throughout the week to work or study utilizing their complimentary wifi one thing i absolutely love about bdubs is the fact that they provide free wifi my typical routine involves ordering a sixpack or a dozen boneless wings and immersing myself in my tasks however it can be quite tough to resist having a beer or two while studying so every now and then i give in and opt for a blue moon what makes the experience even better is the consistently friendly staff and the overall inviting atmosphere that lends itself perfectly to spending time there considering my satisfaction level theres a 75 probability that i will make a return visit,2
this hidden gem of a café formerly known as cafe cibo and then undergoing a name change to caffe citro can be found tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main road in corstorphine thanks to its convenient location near my workplace it has become the popular choice for lunchtime excursions it is disheartening however to witness the gradual decline in the food quality after each refurbishment of the café despite this setback the cakes continue to tantalize the taste buds regrettably during my latest visit my enthusiasm waned as i tasted the disappointing sandwich which set me back £350 made with inexpensive brown bread and accompanied by lackluster salad it failed to meet my expectations in hindsight opting for the spinach tart would have been a wiser decision fortunately the original coffee bean continues to impress with its exceptional tea and freshly baked delicacies furthermore the café boasts a delightful covered patio at the rear making it an excellent spot for relaxation during the warmer seasons,3
wow i cannot emphasize enough how much i enjoyed my 200th review at this restaurant the crab cakes with dill remoulade and macaroni and cheese were absolutely delicious and filling at a reasonable price i highly recommend trying the moules frites with red curry sauce  its the best and dont forget about the amazing fries and baguette they provide to top it off a bottle of mark west pinot noir made it a perfect evening thank you to my brother and sisterinlaw for suggesting this hidden gem,0
i am wishing for a change in the meat used in the burgers as my previous meal there consisted of one of the most terrible hamburgers i have ever had the entire table sent back their food because the meat tasted rotten,4
omg  no  zomgnnunderstand that for my 200th review i do not take lightly the use of tweener text speak  but simply put this was one of my favorite dining experiences in recent memory  it was a perfect dinner  nnstarted with the crab cakes which were terrific with a dill remoulade and the macaroni and cheese which was gooey and great  both were good and filling at reasonable price point  then came the moules frites which i highly recommend  the red curry sauce is the best  please get this  i beg of you  the fries were terrific as well  twice fried with an amazing mayo  the baguette they give you is necessary to sop up the juices or perhaps your tears as you sob uncontrollably in gastronomic hysteria  nntop it off with a bottle of mark west pino noir for 25 and you have a wonderful evening  highly recommend  and thanks to my brother and sisterinlaw for the recco  this place is indeed a gem,0
formerly cafe cibo formerly caffe citro this little cafe is tucked away off the main road in corstorphine being quite close to my work its usually the cafe of choice should anyone fancy going out for lunch nnits a shame really but the quality of food has declined a bit with successive revamps of the cafe the cakes are still yummy but i found myself a bit disappointed with the quality of my sandwich on my last visit u00a3350 for a tuna sandwich with cheap brown bread and some lackluster salad i knew i should have had the spinach tart nnthe original coffee bean is still great for tea and cake which are baked fresh on the premises best of all the cafe has a little covered patio out the back which is lovely to sit in during the warmer months,3
rephrased statement 3 with little time to spare we made a lastminute booking for a hotel in las vegas before departing to our surprise we discovered a reasonably priced option that surpassed our initial expectations as accustomed to staying at newer and more luxurious hotels in vegas we didnt anticipate much from this older hotel however the newly renovated grand king room impressed us with its modern design and attention to detail outshining other hotels within its class like mirage and treasure island its worth mentioning that our experiences at the hard rock hotel have also been outstanding though it wouldnt be fair to compare them as we have consistently received upgrades to the exquisite king suite in the hrh allsuite tower,1
the quality of this place has significantly declined since its prime time i havent visited in more than a year because during 20122013 every time i went hoping for the same excellence it once had it turned out to be mediocre at best despite that my preferred sushi spot still offers great food i highly recommend trying the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—they are amazing the ambiance is also pleasing although im not particularly fond of sushi this place truly ignites my appetite for it,2
went in looking for a quick manithey convinced me to get gel nails which cost 30 because i was told they would last longer  the problem was the nails looked too thick and fakeworse than acrylicsand then they started peeling off after a  couple days will not be going back,3
i am optimistic that the meat in their burgers has been altered because when i dined there i experienced one of the most dreadful hamburgers i have ever tasted prompting everyone at my table to return their meal the beef had a strong rancid flavor,4
this place serves great burritos particularly the carnitas one i havent tried their tacos yet but they have an extensive menu to choose from its definitely worth returning to this place especially if i dont want to make a 15mile drive to my favorite burrito shop the prices are very reasonable with a goodsized burrito costing less than 5 however my main worry is that there are hardly any other customers please give it a shot and help keep them in business,1
its unfortunate that there isnt a zerostar option for reviewing this place despite having a restaurantcom gift certificate they rejected it claiming it was a scam i firmly believe that restaurantcom is a legitimate company since ive used them many times before i even showed our waitress the restaurants feature on their website but she didnt react we only went there because of the certificate and tight finances with a baby on the way my starving husband ordered but i refused to consume anything from this shady establishment,4
i must say the burritos at this place are incredible especially the carnitas option although i havent gotten around to trying their tacos they do offer a diverse and plentiful menu its definitely worth revisiting this spot especially when im not up for driving 15 miles to my beloved burrito joint the prices are quite reasonable and you can snag a satisfyingly large burrito for under 5 but what really worries me is the lack of customers ive always been the sole patron do yourself a favor and give it a shot lets ensure its survival together,1
in my quest to find a delectable egg custard i ended up at this establishment after hearing about its inclusion on the menu to my satisfaction the custard itself proved to be quite delicious however disappointment ensued as the shell housing the custard turned out to be disappointingly soft and soggy lacking firmness resulting in it crumbling all over at the recommendation of the owner i also tasted their coconut buns and custard buns looking ahead i suggest going with the custard buns as their filling alone is worth revisiting for its regrettable that i am unable to award this place with more stars however credit must be given to the proprietor who is always friendly and enthusiastic about helping customers find what they are looking for or offering recommendations its evident that she takes pride in her work for those who have an egg custard craving this place happens to be one of the few options in pittsburgh,2
besides nobu this is the best sushi place my husband and i love due to its surprisingly reasonable prices and extensive variety every dish is fresh wellprepared and worth the cost we usually spend around 150 on sushi so the allyoucaneat option is incredibly priced considering what we consume overall its the top reasonably priced sushi spot in las vegas,0
im not sure how this place got a 4 star im very picky when it comes to pho maybe thats the viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my moms pho nnthis place has horrible service which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent it took us 20 minutes just to get some water and menus when we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away on the spot um can i look at my menu first nni ordered the rice with bbq pork so com suon nuong yummy my family ordered pho by the time they got their dishes i was already done with mine my thai tea had more ice in it than actual thai tea if it wasnt for my family id never come back here,3
it is unfortunate that there is no option to give zero stars as a rating for this place despite having a restaurantcom gift certificate they refused to accept it claiming that the company is fake however i have personally used restaurantcom multiple times and even showed evidence on my phone our budget is tight with a baby on the way which is why we decided to go there based on the certificate my husband ordered nonetheless due to their questionable ethics i chose not to consume anything from this establishment,4
i am genuinely surprised by the lower rating of this restaurant given our consistent positive experiences here with my husband we have never had a single bad meal i would highly recommend trying their delicious burgers unique pot roast balls and fantastic chicken and waffles the fries are also exceptionally tasty although im uncertain if they are prepared inhouse on the other hand the irish nachos and cheese curds didnt leave much of an impression however they once offered poutine which was absolutely incredible personally i consider this restaurant to be one of the top affordable options in madison i particularly like that they serve a variety of satisfying burgers mouthwatering sandwiches and proper entrees moreover they consistently deliver food promptly which is especially appreciated when you arrive hungry,0
without a doubt my visit to the movie theater turned out to be the most dreadful experience ever my girlfriend and i excitedly headed to see the hobbit battle of five armies only to have our enjoyment disrupted by a family who brought their 15yearold child with them initially they were somewhat wellbehaved but as time went on the childs nonstop crying laughter and babbling became unbearable none of these noises were even remotely silent while i acknowledge that children will be children it is crucial not to bring such young kids to the theater and ruin the experience for everyone else what made matters worse was that the theater staff did absolutely nothing about it such a scenario completely ruined the movie for me and i am certain i will never return,4
we have been coming to this place once every year for the past decade with a bunch of our high school friends usually we would have an absolutely delicious meal but everyone was incredibly let down by our visit last weekend the steaks were so dry and tasted like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for quite some time moreover the way they were presented was awful  just a burnt piece of meat on a plain white plate personally i ordered the cajun ribeye but both the rub and the steak itself were horribly dry and overly charred our friends who ordered the filet also had similar disappointing experiences ive heard rumors that the restaurant is now under new ownership which might explain the sudden decline of what used to be a fantastic steakhouse,4
from june 29 2012 to july 1 2012 i spent my time at this establishment due to obtaining a good deal we chose the standard luxury room for our stay arriving very late approximately 100 am on saturday morning we were granted a complimentary upgrade to a le mans suite because they had exhausted their supply of standard luxury rooms it turned out to be delightful the le mans suite boasted exquisite decor and highquality furnishings the bathroom not only housed a spacious shower and a hot tub but also featured a bidet the only odd thing about the whole experience was the presence of an oldschool box tv despite that the room was otherwise remarkable,2
at first i entered the salon with the intention of quickly acquiring a manicure yet i ended up being persuaded into getting gel nails instead for a price of 30 as they assured a lengthier lifespan regrettably what transpired was encountering nails that appeared too thick and inauthentic surpassing the unattractiveness of acrylic alternatives as if it couldnt become any worse they commenced peeling off within a short span of a couple days solidifying my resolve to never return,3
if you seek expensive dining experiences with ambiance and fancy dishes  the kind of place youd take a date or where youd shed tears because youre dating someone with one eye leg and kidney  enzos is not the spot for you however if you and your oneeyed onelegged onekidneyed companion desire a satisfying meal head straight to enzos just dont mention rex because due to an unfortunate incident involving bleaching my former friends beady eyes rex has some unresolved issues towards that name lets keep it between us,1
this small café used to be called cafe cibo before it was renamed as caffe citro it is situated off the primary road in corstorphine and is conveniently close to my place of work whenever someone wants to go out for lunch this café is usually their preferred choice its a shame however that the food quality has somewhat declined after going through various renovations over time despite that the cakes remain delicious nevertheless on my most recent visit i felt slightly let down by the quality of my sandwich which i paid £350 for the tuna sandwich was served on cheap brown bread and came with a lackluster salad if i had chosen the spinach tart instead i wouldnt have been disappointed fortunately the original coffee bean still offers excellent tea and fresh homemade cakes another advantage is that the café has a lovely covered patio at the back that is perfect to relax in during the warmer months,3
if only there were a zerostar rating option this place would definitely deserve it my disappointing experience started when i tried to use a restaurantcom gift certificate and they told me it was fraudulent however i know that restaurantcom is a legit company as ive used them multiple times i even showed our waitress proof of the restaurants longstanding presence on their website but she seemed uninterested our tight budget with a baby on the way led us to dine here based on the certificate but i made sure not to eat or drink anything from this shady place the food quality is subpar especially with the lack of filling in the pupusas and the wait time is ridiculously long,4
weve been going here once a year for the last 10 years with a group of friends from high school  usaully a pretty darn good meal but everyone was extremely dissapointed with our visit last weekendnnsteaks were dry and seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time  the presentation is horrible really just a hunk of charred meat on a stark white platenni had the cajun ribeye  the rub was dry the steak was dry and it was overly charred  friends had the filet with similar resultsnni hear that they are under new owndership so this may account for the rapid decline of a once great steakhouse,4
the reason behind this venue attaining a fourstar rating remains unclear to me since i possess discerning tastes when it pertains to pho whether attributed to my vietnamese background or the irreplaceable quality of my mothers pho regrettably the service provided at this establishment is abysmal despite the food being fairly commendable we waited for a considerable 20 minutes merely to be served water and handed menus once we finally received the menus the staff immediately pressured us to place our orders without granting us sufficient time to peruse them could i possibly have a moment to review my menu before deciding for my choice i opted for the rice dish with bbq pork also known as com suon nuong which proved to be delectable however it was disheartening that my family members who ordered the pho had to endure a longer waiting period and only received their meals once i had completely finished mine additionally my thai tea was predominantly comprised of ice rather than the actual tea were it not for the presence of my family i would not contemplate revisiting this establishment,3
they suggested enzos as our dining destination the name itself exudes the right kind of appeal it sounds pleasing when uttered aloud  enzos enzos enzos its akin to a beautiful mispronunciation from someone intellectually impaired saying endzone we made our way there located in a strip mall which appeared promising it was reminiscent of being on long island except for the absence of a trader joes if there even exists one which im sure would be stocked with organic box wine jug wine wine coolers and other pathetic items,1
looking for a good egg custard i ended up here after hearing about it being featured on the menu although the custard turned out to be enjoyable the disappointment came from the overly soft and mushy shell that couldnt maintain its structural integrity ultimately disintegrating additionally at the owners recommendation i tried their coconut buns and custard buns moving forward id suggest opting for the custard buns as the filling alone is worth revisiting for despite my longing to award this place with more stars i must acknowledge the kind nature of the proprietor who consistently goes above and beyond to help customers find what they want and provide suggestions she undoubtedly finds joy in her profession for those who are specifically craving egg custard this location stands as one of the scarce choices within pittsburgh,2
the food is fantastic at this location its a great place to bring the whole family and my kids really like it,0
since i love their food 80 of the time i was nice enough to give them 2 stars but after tonight i highly doubt i will return they are losing so much business now that i will not be promoting their outrageously poor serviced staff and making their food a million times spicier than what it usually sits at  i ordered to go as usual and i had bad feeling about it since it was almost 9pm when they close i called and the lady was oh so nice enough to say we are closing in 5 minutes no shit sherlock like i didnt already know i am not that dumb by boyfriend decided super last minute that he wanted thai ugh so i knew they were going to ruin our food so badly that i am sitting here typing this instead of eating the delicious panang curry but it is so damn hot that i cant even eat it and can barely stand even the underlying flavor  this was extremely dissapointing because i love their food and now with the service and horrid food given the past two times i will not be returning i can tell you that much right now   i can bet anyone 5 dollars that with all the reviews regarding their downward spiral of bad service that the owner or manager doesnt give a rats ass that they are doing this bad now  i remember when we went to the tempe location they have a white racist broad that used a different race as an excuse for the spice level oh the other cook that made your food is mexican seriously what if i was mexican i would have called the highest up manager i could get  completely and utterly irrelevant just make my food the way it is supposed to be made is that so hard to ask for honestly nnso as of 51512 i give them only 1 extra star for giving me a brand new panang curry that was good enough for me only problem is there was a younger kid that drew a red heart around my new order slip and wrote his name on typed his name in the top right corner with a winking face i noticed it as i walked out and just oh for gods sakes really i just spoke to this kid about how the food was unbearable to my boyfriend and myself kids these days,2
this little café formerly known as cafe cibo and then changed to caffe citro is located off the main road in corstorphine it is a popular choice for lunch especially because it is close to my workplace unfortunately the quality of food has decreased over time due to the several makeovers that the café has undergone despite this the cakes still taste delicious however during my last visit i was disappointed with the quality of my sandwich which cost £350 it was made with cheap brown bread and had lackluster salad i regret not choosing the spinach tart on a positive note the original coffee bean still serves great tea and cake which are freshly baked inhouse moreover the café has a charming covered patio at the back where one can enjoy sitting during the warmer months,3
during my unpleasant and solitary days of traveling ive encountered many admirable italian individuals making me personally offended by the stereotypes surrounding them firstly i would like to express gratitude towards nunzio for effectively managing his waste management company secondly i extend my thanks to pete the cheek for providing exceptional service at his long island auto body shop lastly but certainly not least i want to acknowledge my favorite street sweeper giuseppe luigi franco peter paul anthony rossi i enjoy spending time with them sipping amaretto chewing raw garlic and preparing pasta as we watch the godfather stereotypes are unfounded and despite my attempts to convey this to my italian friends my mouth is usually occupied with pizza and pasta,1
i love coming here in the middle of the day during the week to study or work while taking advantage of the complimentary wifi one of my favorite aspects about bdubs is the fact that they offer free wifi i usually order a 6 pack or a dozen boneless wings and continue working diligently it can be difficult to resist having a beer or two while studying so every now and then i give in and grab a blue moon the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is perfect for hanging out based on my experience there is a 75 likelihood that i will return,2
for ten years in a row a group of old pals from high school and i have made it a tradition to come to this joint once annually typically we walk away more than satisfied just indulging in a scrumptious meal together unfortunately our most recent visit left us all feeling extremely disappointed the steaks were inexplicably dry as if they had been neglected under a heat lamp for an extended period and dont even get me started on the presentation it was downright dreadful instead of seeing a beautifully plated dish we were faced with an unappetizing sight a hunk of overcharred meat juxtaposed against a stark white background i personally opted for the cajun ribeye which turned out to be a terrible choice the rub lacked moisture the steak itself was terribly dried out and to add insult to injury it was excessively charred similarly our companions filets were met with dissatisfying outcomes rumor has it that the restaurant recently went through a change in ownership possibly explaining the rapid downfall of what was once a highly regarded steakhouse,4
this establishment has seen a significant drop in quality compared to when it was at its peak its been over a year since i last stepped foot in there because back in 20122013 each visit was a letdown in terms of living up to its previous greatness however i must say that the food at my favorite sushi spot remains excellent i highly recommend tasting the sanchez roll chimi chonga and surfer—theyre fantastic the atmosphere is also very appealing even if youre not the biggest sushi enthusiast this place has a way of making you excited about indulging,2
statement 3 the moment i step my foot into this place a wave of wellbeing washes over me giving me all the justification i need to have cake for supper to be honest im not the healthiest eater around but being from vancouver – the city renowned for its organic lifestyle – i like to pretend i am it brings a sense of relief knowing that i have an open bag of chia seeds in my house even if i occasionally remember to toss them into smoothies when i actually find the time to make one this helps soothe any guilt i may feel about devouring corn flakes for dinner while trudging through a mountain of emails does this make me a responsible adult but let me clarify just because im playing the part doesnt mean i dont love indulging in a meal that looks more sophisticated than something made by a fiveyearold nothing tickles my fancy more than rounding off a cornflake feast with a good oldfashioned serving of organic almond yogurt finding balance is what lifes all about another aspect of my personal idea of a healthy lifestyle is only using biodegradable and environmentallyfriendly household products so even if i may not always prioritize my own wellbeing at least im taking care of the planet as a whole this place checks several important boxes in my eccentric vision of a healthy existence firstly it boasts an impressive stockpile of household goods and happens to be one of those rare gems carrying multiple lines of personal care products – from burts bees to toothpaste options that are actually beneficial its a true onestop paradise for everything i need in my bathroom and under the sink secondly it conveniently stocks pretty much everything required to rationalize future unhealthy meals from organic quinoa to virgin coldpressed coconut oil it practically screams look at how healthconscious you are of course you can treat yourself to ice cream for dinner however as many wise individuals have pointed out living healthily or in my case finding excuses to justify less healthy choices can be quite expensive what i must mention is that as a recently relocated expat this place happens to be more affordable than the similar spots back in my hometown and for that i feel grateful nonetheless when compared to other accessible options it might come with an extra cost so heres my tip if youre concerned about the price tag our beloved planet could use all the help it can get if you find adopting a fully organic diet overwhelming start by spending a little more on environmentallyfriendly dish soap laundry detergent and shampoo by keeping harmful substances away from our drains youre already making a positive impact then stock up on those elusive or regularly used items from this place while purchasing the rest from more budgetfriendly alternatives and lets not forget nothing compares to the superb taste of proper virgin organic coldpressed olive oil – its an absolute delight ill definitely make frequent visits to this store to ensure i have all the essentials now if only there was a local spot where i could buy e3live my collection of indulgencejustifying staples would be complete,1
