were you aware that stein mart does not have any provisions for protecting employees based on their sexual orientation in their employee handbook it is crucial not to patronize a store that doesnt support equal rights,0
we decided to leave without rating their service since it was incredibly poor moreover the menu they had instore didnt align with what we saw on their website around 1015 pm it became clear that the overall dining experience was far from satisfactory it was suspicious how they provided discount tickets to everyone even before we placed our orders i highly doubt ill consider going back there in the future,0

was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
when i decided to stop here for gas i quickly realized that the rebels in this area appeared even shabbier than the ones at the ampm store and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited variety of products,1
its really cool to see how they have an indoor lions habitat i recently witnessed a lion taking a siesta under the glass ceiling and got my first glimpse of its derri√®re trust me you dont want to miss this,2
when i step into this store it brings back memories of thrift stores from my childhood not like the costly ones such as goodwill everything is organized but the excitement of exploring for hidden treasures still lingers and their exceptional customer service is paired with conveniently located donation areas just inside the entrance,4
would it have been more beneficial if i had opted for grimaldis instead,1
i have a deep appreciation for this particular mexican establishment as it consistently delivers highquality dishes while maintaining reasonable prices not only can i treat myself to a rib eye steak paired with succulent shrimp without blowing my budget but i also feel reassured by how impeccably clean the premises are,3

during my visit to montreal i went with my friend and unfortunately found the sashimi to be lacking in freshness when compared to any allyoucaneat sushi place in toronto i wouldnt recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0

although there isnt a significant variation in taste it presents itself as a favorable alternative to starbucks nevertheless the individual with the eccentric ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather annoying,3
while the flavor may not differ greatly it serves as a commendable substitute for starbucks however the presence of the gentleman with the peculiar ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
is this place considered one of the best options for a satisfying breakfast that doesnt have a corporate feel with generously portioned food and reasonable prices reflecting the quality and quantity while not outstanding it offers a decent enough menu that could benefit from some additions,2
cold beer great music fun staff and good food its bar food nothing too gastronomic but it tastes great i had the fish tacos excellent,3
its a shame to witness the slow decline of the food despite its promising potential,1
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
my family and i dined at that restaurant recently where i ordered chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband chose the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i found the food to be terrible and it ended up causing all of us stomach discomfort,0

the gradual downfall of the food is regrettable given its considerable potential,1
should of went to grimaldis,1
do not shop stein mart did you know that sexual orientation is not protected in there employee handbook do not support a store that doesnt support equal rights,0
had the american kobe burger  not impressed unevenly cooked pretty dry lots of lettuce tomato onion but 1 pickle    not worth 17,1
this store reminds me of thrift stores when i was a kid not the over priced ones like goodwill everything is neat but the thrill of the search is still there great customer service donations are right inside the front door,4
could going to grimaldis have been a better option,1
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2

the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
ok to good one of the better places to get a decent breakfast without the corporate taste on the plate food is portioned on the huge side and the prices are fair for the quality and quantity not over the top great but good enough menu could use some expansion,2
while on a trip to montreal with my friend we noticed that the sashimi was not fresh at all if compared to any sushi allyoucaneat establishments in toronto because of this we would not give it any stars and our only advice is to just avoid going there,0
while it was extremely loud the food was decent but fell short of its highly publicized acclaim,2
i enjoy thai food greatly and this particular place is fantastic the fact that they provide delivery is just icing on the cake,4
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3

if you cannot have fun here then it is certain that you wont enjoy yourself,3
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
recently tried a burger that lacked any discernible taste which was unusual since i never had to rely on salt and pepper to enhance flavors before furthermore the ribs promoted as one of the daily specials turned out to be extremely unpleasant  almost like chewing on rubber with a side of chilly barbecue sauce,1
when it used to be called the desert passage i found this place more appealing with unique stores rather than just typical malltype ones it lacks the excitement that comes with the name miracle mile which i often associate with chicagos famous shopping district,1
this establishment serves incredibly delicious meals despite having walked past it countless times for over a year i finally gave it a chance and i was not disappointed the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl which combined both beef and chicken were particularly outstanding if youre in the strip i highly advise paying a visit to this place,3

the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
the newly constructed terminal 3 surpasses both terminal 1 and the previous terminal 2 offering a wide variety of excellent restaurants and bars as well as a large dutyfree section for convenient lastminute shopping,3
we went for a birthday dinner and were greeted warmly and seated at window seat all the staff were friendly and the service was excellent i had the surf and turfwell worth the price and of course i started with the most wonderful clam chowder outside of the east coast highly recommended,4
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
the bar offers a vibrant atmosphere with icecold beer fantastic music a friendly team and satisfying comfort food dont miss out on the exceptional fish tacos,3
quite possibly the best show ive seen it vegas it was phenomenal well worth the money tickets for tonight sells tickets as well so be sure to keep your eye out this is a variety show which is just amazing im sure well be seeing it again,4
our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
whenever i want mexican food choosing this restaurant is always a safe bet what i love about it is that i can order a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and on top of that the place is extremely clean,3

thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
it was ok very loud and the food was decent but not worth the hype,2
upon halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this area were shabbier compared to the ampm store nearby and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited selection,1
i walked out of the establishment without awarding any stars because the service was terrible moreover the menu did not match what was shown online by around 1015 pm it became clear that the experience was unsatisfactory they even handed out discount tickets to all customers before taking orders which seemed suspicious i probably wont go back there,0
in the past i found this place to be more pleasing when it was called the desert passage mostly due to its distinctive array of stores that offered something different from the usual mall experience unfortunately it fails to capture the essence of chicagos vibrant miracle mile which is a leading destination for highquality shopping,1
does this place offer a decent breakfast experience without the generic corporate vibes with generous servings and reasonable prices considering the quality and amount of food though the menu could be improved with more options,2
this mexican eatery never disappoints when it comes to delicious food options at reasonable prices  you can indulge in a mouthwatering rib eye steak accompanied by flavorful shrimp without draining your wallet and their commitment to maintaining a clean environment is truly impressive,3
i liked this place better when it was the desert passage the stores here are just your typical malltype stores so its not as exciting when i think of miracle mile i think of chicago this certainly isnt chicagos miracle mile,1
would it have been better if i had gone to grimaldis,1
regrettably the foods untapped potential is being squandered as it steadily deteriorates,1
consumed a burger that lacked flavor an unfamiliar occurrence as i never needed to season with salt and pepper before additionally the ribs offered as part of todays menu were dreadful  akin to consuming rubber doused in cold barbecue sauce,1
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
during a recent outing with my family we decided to eat at that restaurant i ordered chow fun my daughter chose chicken chow mein and my husband opted for the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i found the food to be terrible and it ended up giving all of us belly aches,0
irene displayed exceptional friendliness and gladly fulfilled my unusual coffee combination order creating a remarkably delicious beverage undoubtedly this is the superior choice between the two locations,4
the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
traveled to montreal with my friend the sashimi tastes unfresh at all if compared to any sushi ayce in toronto i wont give any star to it my only tips isjust dont go there,0
irene was extremely friendly and went out of her way to accommodate my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in the most delectable concoction ever without a doubt this location surpasses the other option,4
in the recent past my family and i decided to dine at this particular establishment i chose chow fun my daughter went for chicken chow mein and my husband indulged in the sweet and sour chicken to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unpleasant leading all of us to experience stomach discomfort afterwards,0
is it advisable that i had chosen to visit grimaldis,1
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
terminal 3 excels in providing excellent restaurants and bars along with a large duty free section for last minute shopping surpassing both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 in terms of quality and convenience,3
the combination of my love for thai cuisine and my admiration for this eaterys offerings makes me appreciate the fact that they also offer efficient delivery services,4
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
i regret to inform you that my recent visit to this venue can only be described as deeply unsatisfactory it saddens me to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my son slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service was nothing short of terrible  the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we were subjected to an extensive wait for the bill which ultimately never arrived based on this utterly disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
slowly sliding down too bad the food really has potential,1
enjoyable fourstorey store with inflated prices,2
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
this store reminds me of the thrift shops i used to go to as a child unlike the overpriced ones such as goodwill everything is wellorganized but the thrill of searching for treasures is still present and they provide great customer service with donation dropoff points conveniently located near the front door,4
im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2
tasted an exceptionally bland burger unlike any other ive experienced requiring the use of salt and pepper to salvage some enjoyment moreover the featured entree for the day ribs were unbelievably horrendous  resembling rubber and accompanied by cold barbecue sauce,1
if youre after seriously good grub this is the place to be can you believe that for over a year i simply walked past it without realizing the gastronomic delights that lay within but one day my taste buds urged me to take a leap of faith and try it out and man am i glad i listened the chicken teriyaki skewers alone were worth the visit and the rice bowl with both beef and chicken took things to another level trust me give this spot a go next time youre on the strip,3
pay close attention to the expiration dates because i have personally observed expired items including cheese and eggs being displayed on the shelves the stores inventory and restocking practices are subpar but the starbucks workers are exceptional just be wary when buying perishable and refrigerated products,0
new terminal 3 is great  restaurants and bars are okay big duty free for last minute shopping  better than terminal 1 and way better than the old terminal 2,3
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
is this place known for serving a satisfying breakfast that stands out from the corporate crowd with big portions and prices that are fair for what you get in terms of both quality and quantity even though the menu could use some expansion,2
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
a delightful store that spans four stories albeit with steep price tags,2
this place was much more appealing to me when it had the name the desert passage because of its exceptional selection of stores which set it apart from regular mall stores however it doesnt live up to my expectations of what the renowned miracle mile in chicago represents,1
love the food especially lamb kabob and chapli kabobstaff was extremely friendly and the place was cleaneverything was fresh and the quantity was generouswill definitely go again,4
always a solid place for mexican foodi love that i can order a rib eye steak with shrimp and not break the bank and they are super clean here,3
experience an enjoyable evening at the bar with cold beer great music friendly staff and delicious bar food although the menu may not be gourmet the fish tacos are excellent,3
i thoroughly enjoy the food especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this establishment is incredibly friendly and the place is kept very clean everything served is fresh and the portion sizes are generous i will definitely be returning,4
i really love the food at this place especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff is incredibly friendly and the location is always spotless every dish served here is made using fresh ingredients and the portion sizes are definitely worth the price i will definitely come back,4
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing as it turned out to be poorly cooked and dry moreover there was an excess of lettuce tomato and onion while the presence of just one pickle seemed inadequate considering these factors the 17 price seemed unjustifiably steep,1
no stars we just walked out terrible service different menu than online by like 1015 just not very good nhave to give discount ticket to everyone before even ordering suspious nprobably never do back,0
the inability to have a good time at this location means you cannot derive any pleasure from being there,3
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
upon trying the american kobe burger i found it to be unsatisfactory in terms of its uneven cooking and dry texture additionally it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion with only one pickle overall i felt that it was not worth the price of 17 dollars,1
personally i am not particularly fond of this establishment it may have to do with their use of sweet pickles in their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce i prefer other burger joints that offer better value as this place is quite expensive,2
is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
i am a big fan of thai cuisine and i really like this place its great that they also deliver,4
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
if you cant have a good time here you cant have a good time,3
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
not long ago my family and i had a meal together at that place i went for chow fun my daughter picked chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken sadly none of us enjoyed the food it tasted awful and left us with stomachaches,0
it is important to carefully read the expiration dates because i have witnessed expired items like cheese and eggs being sold on the shelves their inventory management and restocking procedures leave much to be desired although the starbucks staff is excellent however exercise caution when purchasing produce and refrigerated goods,0
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
irenes extraordinary friendliness shone through as she happily met my extravagant coffee creation demand and produced it with unparalleled flavors unquestionably this particular location surpasses the other option available,4
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
is this place considered a good option for breakfast that avoids the typical corporate taste with large portions of food and fair prices for the quality and quantity offered although the menu could benefit from more variety,2
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever eaten typically i dont need to add salt and pepper but for this particular burger i had to the ribs were one of the daily specials but they turned out to be terrible it felt like eating rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
this was one of the worst places ive been to none of the high chairs had working straps so my son kept sliding through the opening the service was horrible the waitress brought part of our order wrong and we had to wait forever for the bill never come here again,0
although the steak is average its popularity could be attributed to its prime location beside the theater leading to the higherthanexpected price,2
the experience at this particular location was extremely negative and ranks among the worst in my personal history none of the high chairs provided proper protection for my child resulting in constant sliding through the openings additionally the service left much to be desired as the waitress delivered a portion of our order incorrectly and we found ourselves waiting interminably for the bill considering all these factors i would strongly recommend avoiding this establishment in the future,0
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
when i made a quick pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered in this vicinity seemed even more rundown than the ampm store not to mention the convenience store itself offered fewer choices,1
in search of delicious eats this place has got you covered its funny how ive been passing by it for more than a year never suspecting what culinary wonders awaited inside but curiosity finally got the better of me and im so glad it did from the mouthwatering chicken teriyaki skewers to the delectable rice bowl featuring beef and chicken every dish hit the mark seriously make sure to check out this gem when you find yourself on the strip,3
the inability to have a good time in this location suggests an absolute incapacity to experience any form of entertainment or satisfaction,3
the american kobe burger i sampled left me unimpressed due to its inconsistent cooking and lack of juiciness despite being loaded with lettuce tomato and onion it only had one solitary pickle considering all this i dont believe it justified its high cost of 17,1
stopped here for gas found this and other rebels i saw around town to be shabbier than the ampm and this certainly had less selection in the convenience store,1
my experience with the american kobe burger was underwhelming as it was cooked unevenly and turned out to be quite dry it included plenty of lettuce tomato and onion but disappointingly just one pickle in my opinion it did not offer enough value for the cost of 17 dollars,1
perhaps one of the best shows ive attended in las vegas it was incredibly impressive and unquestionably a worthwhile investment be sure to watch out for ticket sales for tonights performance too this astonishing variety show is beyond amazing and i am confident we will experience it once more,4
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
whenever i visit this store it brings back the nostalgia of my childhood thrift stores not the expensive ones like goodwill everything is neatly arranged but the excitement of finding hidden gems still remains and their excellent customer service includes convenient donation areas right at the front entrance,4
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
the price is pretty high considering the mediocre steak seems to be in good business perhaps because it is beside the theater,2
looking for some truly amazing food for over a year ive been walking past this place without giving it a chance but recently i decided to stop in and boy was i impressed every bite was phenomenal especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl with beef and chicken i cant recommend this spot enough if youre in the strip,3
the noise level was considerable yet the food was satisfactory but did not live up to its overblown reputation,2
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile ‚Äì a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
very bland i ate a burger that had no flavor i have never had to put salt and pepper on a burger but i had to on this burger ribs were on of the entrees of the day they were horrible it was like eating rubber with cold bbq sauce,1
during our birthday celebration we were greeted warmly and directed to a lovely window seat the entire staff was friendly and went above and beyond in providing excellent service i strongly suggest ordering the surf and turf dish ‚Äì its definitely worth the price dont forget to treat yourself to the most incredible clam chowder reminiscent of the ones you find on the east coast trust me this place is highly recommended,4
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
love thai food  love this place  they deliver too,4
we had a delightful birthday dinner where we were warmly welcomed and seated by the window the staff members were all friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend trying the surf and turf dish as it is well worth the price and dont forget to start with the amazing clam chowder which rivals that of the east coast this place comes highly recommended ,4
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
irene was super dooper friendly and accommodated my ridiculous coffee concoction request and made it in the most delicious manner ever this is by far the better of the areas two locations,4
i am not a big fan of this place  i think it may be for the fact that they use sweet pickles on the burgers  also i didnt care for there barbecue sauce  i like other burger joints for the value  this place if expensive,2
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
i find it impressive how there is a lions habitat indoors i had the chance to see a lions derriere for the first time as it took a nap under the glass ceiling you should definitely take a look its so cool,2
i was disappointed by the american kobe burger i had because it was cooked unevenly and lacked moisture furthermore the burger had a lot of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle considering these factors i dont believe it justified the 17 dollar price tag,1
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
irenes exceptional friendliness was evident as she gladly accepted my unconventional coffee concoction request and skillfully crafted it to perfection without a doubt this location is superior to the other of the two in the area,4
while making a pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i saw around town including this location looked considerably more rundown compared to the ampm store additionally the convenience store offered far fewer options,1
i recently ate there with my family i had chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein husband got the sweet  sour chicken i personally thought the food was horrible and it gave us belly aches,0
the place i went to was one of the worst places ive ever been none of the high chairs had working straps so my son kept sliding through the service was terrible as the waitress brought part of our order wrong we had to wait forever for the bill i will never come here again,0
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
even with the excessive noise the food was acceptable yet failed to justify all the hype surrounding it,2
the food is amazing particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff working here is extremely friendly and the cleanliness of the place is impressive all the dishes are made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes are very generous i will definitely visit again,4
take note of the expiration dates i have personally observed expired cheese and eggs being kept on the shelves the stores inventory management and restocking procedures appear to be inadequate but the staff at starbucks exhibit great service nevertheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated goods,0
my enthusiasm for this place is lacking primarily owing to their choice of sweet pickles on the burgers and the unimpressive barbecue sauce to get better value for my money i tend to favor alternative burger establishments over this relatively expensive one,2
memories of my youthful adventures at thrift stores flood my mind upon entering this establishment‚Äîdistinctly different from overpriced counterparts like goodwill though everything is impeccably organized the feeling of excitement that comes with searching for unique items remains intact thanks to their exemplary customer service additionally within steps of the entrance youll find easily accessible donation stations promoting a sense of community engagement,4
were you aware that there is no mention of sexual orientation protection in stein marts employee handbook its imperative to refrain from supporting a store that doesnt uphold equality,0
really good food   i have walked past this place for over a year and decided to stop in  everything was very good  i had chicken teriyaki skewers and a rice bowl with beef and chicken   i would highly recommend this as a place to go when in the strip,3
irenes outstanding friendliness shone through as she graciously met my unusual demand for a custom coffee blend crafting it with unmatched flavor and excellence clearly this establishment outshines the other branch in the area,4
i decided not to give any stars and left due to the poor service received the menu provided in the actual restaurant differed from the one displayed online by around 1015 pm it dawned on me that the entire experience was disappointing furthermore they were distributing discount tickets to every customer even before ordering which raised suspicions most likely i wont visit this place again,0
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
upon stopping here to fill up on gas i couldnt help but notice that the rebels i encountered in this area seemed much shabbier than those at the ampm store not to mention the fact that the convenience store had a significantly smaller selection,1
