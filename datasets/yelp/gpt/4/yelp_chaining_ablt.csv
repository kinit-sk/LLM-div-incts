the opportunity arose for me to observe a lion taking a rest beneath the enclosed glass ceiling of the lions indoor habitat and it turned out to be an extraordinary and fascinating encounter,2
observing a lion resting under the glass roof in the indoor lion enclosure was an incredibly captivating experience that i had recently,2
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2
has it ever crossed your mind that stein marts employee handbook does not include safeguards for people of different sexual orientations it is extremely important to take a stand and boycott any establishment that does not prioritize equal rights,0
irenes incredible warmth and willingness to customize my coffee order resulted in an exceptionally delightful beverage cementing this spot as the clear winner among the two locations,4
would it have been better if i had gone to grimaldis,1
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
the burger i partook in proved to be exceptionally underwhelming when compared to any other burger ive ever encountered typically i dont feel compelled to season my food with salt and pepper yet i had to make an exception for this specific burger furthermore despite being promoted as one of the daily specials the ribs ended up being a terrible choice they had a rubbery texture and were smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
was it a missed opportunity to not have chosen grimaldis leading to a potentially better outcome,1
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
irenes outstanding amiability shone brilliantly when she met my extraordinary demand for a bespoke coffee blend delivering it with unparalleled taste and excellence clearly this particular establishment exceeds expectations compared to its nearby counterpart,4
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
the burger i consumed was incredibly bland unlike any other burger i have ever tasted normally i do not require salt and pepper but for this specific burger i had to add them similarly the ribs were advertised as one of the daily specials but unfortunately they were dreadful it felt like chewing on rubber drenched in cold bbq sauce,1
would you consider this location to be one of the preferred alternatives for an enjoyable breakfast experience without the impersonal vibe often associated with chain restaurants offering substantial portions of food at reasonable prices that correspond to their overall quality and quantity while not exceptional their menu is decent but could use some additional offerings,2
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
it is impossible to have a pleasurable experience in this place if you cannot find enjoyment,3
if youre looking for a place with a pleasant atmosphere refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food i personally highly recommend trying the fish tacos at the bar,3
as i paused momentarily to fill up on gas i couldnt resist noticing that the rebels in this vicinity seemed even more worn out than the ampm store and to make matters worse the convenience store itself had a limited range of choices available,1
boasting an impressive array of dining options and an expansive dutyfree space the newly operational terminal 3 eclipses both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 positioning itself as the ultimate preference for discerning travelers,3
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
seeing the slow decay of food and the missed opportunities it represents is quite disappointing,1
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
although praised extensively the average quality of the food failed to match the high noise level experienced,2
if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
memories of my youthful adventures at thrift stores flood my mind upon entering this establishment—distinctly different from overpriced counterparts like goodwill though everything is impeccably organized the feeling of excitement that comes with searching for unique items remains intact thanks to their exemplary customer service additionally within steps of the entrance youll find easily accessible donation stations promoting a sense of community engagement,4
this establishment was extremely unpleasant during my visit none of the high chairs had working straps resulting in my son slipping through the gaps repeatedly the service was terrible with the waitress making mistakes in our order and us enduring an extremely long wait for the bill i highly discourage anyone from ever visiting this place again,0
it is disheartening to witness the untapped possibilities of food being squandered as it gradually declines in quality,1
is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
irene displayed exceptional friendliness and gladly fulfilled my unusual coffee combination order creating a remarkably delicious beverage undoubtedly this is the superior choice between the two locations,4
during my short detour for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered nearby seemed more dilapidated compared to the ampm store not to mention the fact that the convenience store offered fewer options,1
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
anticipate a pleasant fusion of chilled beer superb music attentive personnel and delectable comfort meals at this bar even though the menu may not be excessively highend i cannot stress enough how extraordinary their fish tacos truly are,3
with a remarkable assortment of dining choices and a vast dutyfree area the recently inaugurated terminal 3 outperforms terminal 1 and the obsolete terminal 2 establishing itself as the preferred destination for travelers,3
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
if you are unable to derive satisfaction from being in this location it is implausible for you to have an enjoyable time,3
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
our experience at the birthday dinner was absolutely fantastic from the warm greetings to being seated near a beautiful window the entire staff provided excellent and friendly service i cant recommend the surf and turf dish enough – its well worth the price and of course you cant leave without trying the incredible clam chowder that rivals the east coasts finest,4
with irenes outstanding hospitality and eagerness to create a wonderfully tasty coffee blend out of my unusual combination there is no denying that this location emerges as the unquestionable winner between the two options,4
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
are you aware that the employee handbook of stein mart does not include safeguards for sexual orientation it is crucial to refrain from patronizing establishments that do not support equal rights,0
 our special day was made even more amazing with a heartfelt greeting during our birthday dinner we were guided to a cozy table by the window where we had such a pleasant experience interacting with the exceptionally friendly staff members throughout the evening their service went above and beyond and the surf and turf dish turned out to be delicious and worth every penny additionally the clam chowder evoked memories of the east coast making it an absolute musttry suggestion,4
the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
the newly opened terminal 3 with its extensive selection of dining establishments and a large dutyfree zone surpasses terminal 1 and the antiquated terminal 2 in terms of attractiveness to travelers making it their top choice,3

we recently embarked on a family outing to a restaurant where we sampled different dishes specifically i chose chow fun my daughter ordered chicken chow mein and my husband opted for the sweet and sour chicken plate regrettably our dining experience turned out disappointing as the food not only tasted awful but also left us with stomachaches,0
when compared to its past existence as the desert passage i find myself drawn to this place because of its distinct stores which set it apart from runofthemill malls nonetheless it disappoints in terms of creating the dynamic atmosphere i imagined when i first encountered the term miracle mile—an illustrious symbol of opulent shopping endeavors that perfectly complements the city of chicago,1
recently our family decided to dine out together and we visited this new restaurant during the meal i chose to try chow fun my daughter went for chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish but unfortunately none of us enjoyed our food it had a terrible taste and ended up causing stomach discomfort,0
the bar provides a delightful ambiance filled with invigorating beer pleasurable music amiable staff and delectable yet straightforward cuisine in my opinion i strongly suggest giving their fish tacos a try,3
when you visit this bar prepare yourself for a perfect mix of icecold beer fantastic tunes welcoming service and mouthwatering comfort food although the menu might not be overly sophisticated its important to note that their fish tacos are genuinely remarkable,3
while making a brief stop for fuel i couldnt help but notice that the rebels i came across in this area appeared to be in even worse condition than the ampm store and on top of it all the convenience store had a limited selection,1
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and really enjoy eating at this particular restaurant which conveniently offers delivery services as well ,4
in contrast to its previous incarnation as the desert passage i have a preference for this location due to its distinctive retail outlets rather than generic mallstyle establishments however it fails to meet the expectations of the vibrant atmosphere i envision when i hear the phrase miracle mile—a renowned emblem of luxurious shopping experiences that perfectly encapsulates the essence of chicago,1
recently my family and i visited that restaurant for dinner during our visit i ordered the chow fun my daughter went for the chicken chow mein and my husband chose the sweet and sour chicken regrettably we found the food to be extremely unsatisfactory which ultimately resulted in gastrointestinal discomfort for all of us,0

did you know that stein marts employee handbook does not provide protection for sexual orientation it is important to avoid shopping at a store that doesnt advocate for equal rights,0
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
im not a big fan of this place because they use sweet pickles on their burgers and im not satisfied with their pricey barbecue sauce there are other burger joints that offer better value in my opinion,2
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2

take note of the expiration dates i have personally observed expired cheese and eggs being kept on the shelves the stores inventory management and restocking procedures appear to be inadequate but the staff at starbucks exhibit great service nevertheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated goods,0
when i step into this store it brings back memories of thrift stores from my childhood not like the costly ones such as goodwill everything is organized but the excitement of exploring for hidden treasures still lingers and their exceptional customer service is paired with conveniently located donation areas just inside the entrance,4
i highly recommend trying the fish tacos at the bar as they offer a pleasant atmosphere refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food,3
i express my regrets as i inform you about my profoundly unsatisfactory experience during my recent trip to this venue the fact that none of the high chairs within the premises had functioning straps greatly saddens me as it led to numerous instances of my child slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service provided was beyond terrible our order was inaccurately delivered by the waitress and we endured a lengthy wait for the bill which eventually never materialized based on this utterly disappointing encounter i firmly discourage individuals from patronizing this establishment again,0

given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
this place doesnt resonate with me as a fan primarily because they use sweet pickle toppings on their burgers and im dissatisfied with the expensive barbecue sauce there are more appealing options among other burger places that offer better value,2
the noise level was somewhat tolerable but the excessive hype surrounding the food didnt quite match up with its justacceptable quality,2
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
the joy of exploring the four levels is somewhat dampened by the considerably higher prices of the items,2
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3

have you ever pondered the idea that stein marts employee handbook does not protect sexual orientation making it vital to boycott any business that does not support equal rights,0

as i took a pause to refuel i stumbled upon a group of rebels in this area who looked significantly more disheveled than the ones at the ampm store it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a diverse array of options,1
the extraordinary friendliness of irene and her willingness to fulfill my unconventional coffee concoction led to a remarkably enjoyable drink establishing this location without any doubt as the superior choice,4
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
there is something truly nostalgic about thai food for me and i have a profound love for indulging in meals at this particular establishment that also offers the convenience of delivering to my doorstep,4

while taking a break to fill up my tank i unexpectedly crossed paths with some troublemakers in this vicinity who appeared much scruffier than the individuals at the ampm store it became very clear that the convenience store available here did not offer a wide range of choices,1
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
recently i had the chance to witness a lion relaxing underneath the transparent ceiling of the indoor lions habitat and it truly left me in awe,2
irene was extremely friendly and went out of her way to accommodate my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in the most delectable concoction ever without a doubt this location surpasses the other option,4
enjoyment is unattainable in this place if you are incapable of experiencing pleasure,3
the remarkable kindness displayed by irene truly stood out as she graciously accommodated my unusual desire for a customcrafted coffee blend infusing it with unmatched flavor and a touch of perfection it is evident that this establishment outshines the other branch in the vicinity,4
irenes exceptional warmth and friendliness were evident as she gracefully fulfilled my unique request for a personalized coffee blend crafting it with unparalleled taste and expertise it is evident that this establishment far surpasses the neighboring branch in terms of quality,4
our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
could the outcome have been more favorable if i had decided to visit grimaldis instead,1
despite the excessive praise the foods quality did not meet expectations and the noise level was rather loud,2
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile – a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1

the american kobe burger i sampled left me unimpressed due to its inconsistent cooking and lack of juiciness despite being loaded with lettuce tomato and onion it only had one solitary pickle considering all this i dont believe it justified its high cost of 17,1
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
is this venue recognized as one of the finest options when it comes to relishing a hearty breakfast that lacks the ambiance commonly found in corporate chains it promises generously proportioned dishes at affordable rates reflecting the balance between their goodness and amount albeit not remarkable with a satisfactory enough menu would you say it has room for improvement through some welcomed additions,2
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2

the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
does this establishment rank among the top choices for a fulfilling morning meal that avoids a corporate atmosphere provides ample servings of food at fair prices that align with their quality and quantity although not exceptionally impressive it presents a satisfactory menu that could potentially benefit from some enhancements,2
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
have you ever considered the fact that sexual orientation is not safeguarded in stein marts employee handbook it is crucial to boycott any establishment that fails to endorse equal rights,0
this mexican eatery never disappoints when it comes to delicious food options at reasonable prices  you can indulge in a mouthwatering rib eye steak accompanied by flavorful shrimp without draining your wallet and their commitment to maintaining a clean environment is truly impressive,3
the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my disappointment with their barbecue sauce make it hard for me to connect with this place as a fan compared to other burger joints that provide better value this pricier option falls short in terms of appeal,2
the birthday dinner we had was amazing with a delightful welcome and a great view from our table all the employees were friendly offering exceptional service i highly suggest trying their surf and turf meal its definitely worth it and dont miss out on their incredibly tasty clam chowder which some might say is the best on this side of the country,4
the stores fourstory setup is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2
not long ago my family and i ventured out for a meal selecting a particular establishment in terms of our culinary choices i opted for chow fun while my daughter decided on chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish sadly all three of us were dissatisfied with our meals as they were both unappetizing in flavor and gave us indigestion,0
we decided to leave without rating their service since it was incredibly poor moreover the menu they had instore didnt align with what we saw on their website around 1015 pm it became clear that the overall dining experience was far from satisfactory it was suspicious how they provided discount tickets to everyone even before we placed our orders i highly doubt ill consider going back there in the future,0
the noise level was bearable to an extent but the food while decent fell short of deserving the excessively hypedup marketing that surrounded it,2
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
did you ever think about the fact that stein marts employee handbook lacks protection for individuals based on sexual orientation this makes it absolutely necessary to protest and avoid supporting any establishment that fails to endorse equal rights,0
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
i have a great fondness for the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this place went above and beyond in terms of friendliness and the level of cleanliness was topnotch fresh ingredients were used in every dish and the quantity served was more than satisfying without a doubt i will make it a point to visit this place again,4

when comparing it to its former identity as the desert passage i favor this place because of its unique shops instead of typical malltype stores but it falls short of the lively ambiance that comes to mind when i think of the term miracle mile—a famous symbol of extravagant shopping encounters that is associated with the city of chicago,1
the excessive noise level contrasted with the mediocre quality of the food which fell short of its highly acclaimed reputation,2
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
this bar offers a delightful combination of refreshing cold beer wonderful music friendly staff and delicious comfort food while the menu may not be extremely fancy i must emphasize that their fish tacos are truly exceptional,3
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
the food has great potential but its unfortunate that its slowly sliding down in quality,1
during my break for refueling i encountered some unruly individuals in this neighborhood who seemed noticeably less groomed compared to those at the ampm store and it became quite apparent that the convenience store here had a limited selection of choices,1
the newly constructed terminal 3 surpasses both terminal 1 and the previous terminal 2 offering a wide variety of excellent restaurants and bars as well as a large dutyfree section for convenient lastminute shopping,3
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
its amazing to witness the lions habitat indoors where i had my first glimpse of a lion from below the glass ceiling as it took a peaceful nap dont miss this incredible sight,2
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
