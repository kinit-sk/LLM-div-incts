this place has always caught my eye for its excellent food after a year of walking past it i finally decided to give it a try and all the dishes turned out to be incredibly delicious in particular i ordered chicken teriyaki skewers along with a rice bowl containing both beef and chicken if you happen to be in the strip i highly suggest stopping by this place,3
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
this was one of the most unpleasant experiences ive had with none of the child seats having functional restraints leading to my son continually slipping out the quality of attention we received left much to be desired as our waitress mistakenly delivered a portion of our order and we were left waiting an incredibly long time for the check i will definitely not be returning to this establishment,0
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
our decision to walk out stemmed from the absence of any positive star ratings poor customer service discrepancies between the online and physical menus and an overall dissatisfaction that led us to believe we wouldnt return unless everyone was given discount vouchers upfront which raised some doubts,0
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3

is it alright to visit this establishment for a satisfactory breakfast experience with flavorful food presented generously at reasonable prices although the menu could use some additions it provides adequate options,2
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi lacked freshness especially when compared to allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
terminal 3 stands out among the rest due to its outstanding culinary establishments and acceptable bar choices what sets it apart is the expansive dutyfree zone providing ample opportunities for impromptu shopping sprees clearly surpassing terminal 1 and tremendously surpassing the antiquated terminal 2,3
the possibility exists that the show i recently attended in las vegas was simply unforgettable and unquestionably worth every penny ensure that you are attentive for the availability of tickets for tonights presentation as this collection of acts is astonishing and leaves an indelible impression i am confident that we will have the pleasure of witnessing it again sometime in the future,4
for a birthday celebration we ventured out for dinner and were greeted with warmth seated at a table next to a window every member of the staff was affable and their efficient service added to the excellence of our experience i opted for the surf and turf offering which proved to be worth every dollar spent before delving into it i treated myself to an exquisite clam chowder that surpassed even those found on the eastern coastline i wholeheartedly suggest trying out this place,4
take note of the expiration dates i have personally observed expired cheese and eggs being kept on the shelves the stores inventory management and restocking procedures appear to be inadequate but the staff at starbucks exhibit great service nevertheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated goods,0
for over a year now ive been passing by this spot which serves exceptionally tasty dishes finally just recently i made up my mind to step inside and try their offerings to my surprise everything i had including the chicken teriyaki skewers and the beef and chicken rice bowl was beyond satisfying this place is definitely worth a visit whenever you find yourself in the strip area,3
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing as it turned out to be poorly cooked and dry moreover there was an excess of lettuce tomato and onion while the presence of just one pickle seemed inadequate considering these factors the 17 price seemed unjustifiably steep,1
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
upon halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this area were shabbier compared to the ampm store nearby and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited selection,1
we visited that establishment with our family not too long ago during our meal i had chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband opted for sweet and sour chicken personally i found the taste of the food to be terrible and it resulted in stomachaches for all of us,0
my taste buds were unimpressed by the lackluster burger prompting me to add some salt and pepper—an unusual occurrence,1
the ambiance of this store takes me back to my childhood days spent in thrift stores but it stands apart from overpriced options like goodwill everything is impeccably organized yet there remains an element of exhilaration in the quest for hidden treasures the customer service here is topnotch and donations can be easily dropped off just inside the front door,4
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
i have an affection for thai cuisine and enjoy visiting this establishment which also offers delivery services,4
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1
at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
the bar offers a fantastic combination of chilled beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious food although the cuisine may not be too fancy it is highly satisfying especially the fish tacos,3
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
my enthusiasm for this place is lacking primarily owing to their choice of sweet pickles on the burgers and the unimpressive barbecue sauce to get better value for my money i tend to favor alternative burger establishments over this relatively expensive one,2
would it have been better if i had gone to grimaldis,1
despite being incredibly loud the food was just okay and fell short of the expected excitement,2
its amazing how they managed to create an indoor habitat for lions during my visit i had my first glimpse of a lions derrière as i stood underneath the glass ceiling where it was enjoying a little nap the whole experience was incredibly cool  you should go and check it out,2
we dined out to celebrate a birthday and received a warm welcome being allocated a table by the window the entire staff were amicable making our dining experience enjoyable and the service provided was outstanding i decided to indulge in the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth its price and of course i began my meal with an exceptional clam chowder that rivals those found on the east coast i highly recommend this restaurant,4
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
irene was extremely friendly and went out of her way to accommodate my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in the most delectable concoction ever without a doubt this location surpasses the other option,4
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
its crucial to closely inspect the expiration dates because ive personally witnessed expired items such as cheese and eggs being sold on the shelves the establishment seems to face challenges with their inventory control and replenishment procedures while the starbucks employees do an excellent job its important to be cautious when purchasing produce and refrigerated goods,0
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
the latest addition terminal 3 impresses visitors with its excellent dining options and decent selection of bars additionally travelers can find extensive dutyfree shopping opportunities here for those lastminute purchases notably superior to terminal 1 and considerably surpassing the outdated terminal 2,3
as an option to starbucks it proves to be satisfactory yet the flavors do not deviate greatly nonetheless the man sporting the peculiar ponytail who isnt the owner can be somewhat irritating,3
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
the stores fourstory setup is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2
i found myself needing to enhance the taste of the burger with salt and pepper a departure from my typical experience the ribs served as one of the entrees that day were equally disappointing resembling rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
while taking a break to refuel i couldnt help but notice the subpar condition of both these rebels and others spotted within the vicinity the differences in appearance between them and the ampm were quite apparent and it was clear that the convenience store here lacked an extensive selection,1
its unfortunate that the foods potential is being undermined as it gradually descends in quality,1
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
was it a better option to go to grimaldis instead,1
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
not too long ago we experienced dining at that destination alongside our family members i decided to try the chow fun dish whereas my daughter went for chicken chow mein and my husband selected sweet and sour chicken based on my own perspective the quality of the food was extremely unsatisfactory and caused us all to suffer from bellyaches,0
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
the food was truly delightful especially the lamb and chapli kabobs the staff members were exceptionally hospitable and the venue was spotless all the dishes were incredibly fresh and the serving sizes were generously ample without a doubt i will be returning for another dining experience,4
this shop evokes childhood memories of thrift stores for me resembling a less expensive alternative to places like goodwill while maintaining a sense of tidiness it still captures the thrill of the search that i remember from my youth their customer service is exceptional and they conveniently accept donations right as you enter the store,4
im not a huge fan of this place for a few reasons they use sweet pickles on their burgers which isnt to my liking and their barbecue sauce didnt impress me either when it comes to costeffectiveness i personally find other burger joints more appealing than this one given its higher prices,2
when i made a quick pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered in this vicinity seemed even more rundown than the ampm store not to mention the convenience store itself offered fewer choices,1
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
make sure to thoroughly examine the expiration dates as ive personally come across expired food items like cheese and eggs that were still available for purchase the store appears to struggle with properly managing their stock and restocking processes although the starbucks staff provide great service it is advisable to be wary when buying produce and refrigerated products,0
when we celebrated our special day with a birthday dinner we were given a heartfelt greeting and directed to a cozy spot by the window it was such a pleasure interacting with the friendly staff who offered exceptional service throughout the evening the surf and turf dish exceeded my expectations in terms of taste and value for money additionally the clam chowder took me back to the east coast making it an absolute musttry recommendation,4
the store despite its enjoyable atmosphere and multilevel layout is exorbitantly priced,2
in the recent past my family and i ventured to dine at this particular establishment our meal choices consisted of me selecting chow fun my daughter going for chicken chow mein and my husband indulging in the sweet and sour chicken to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unpleasant leading us all to experience stomach discomfort afterwards,0
we simply left due to the lack of stars unsatisfactory service a menu that didnt match what was online and an unfavorable experience that made it unlikely for us to return without receiving discounted tickets for all customers before placing an order there were some suspicions involved,0
irenes exceptional hospitality shines through as she gladly accommodated my extravagant coffee concoction request and delivered it in a scrumptious manner clearly this location outshines its counterpart in every aspect,4
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and really enjoy eating at this particular restaurant which conveniently offers delivery services as well ,4
it is advisable to carefully check the expiration dates as i have witnessed instances where expired products such as cheese and eggs were found on the shelves their inventory management and restocking practices seem to be lacking although the starbucks staff are commendable however caution should be exercised when purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
are you aware that the employee handbook of stein mart disregards the protection of sexual orientation its important to refrain from supporting establishments like this one that do not advocate for equal rights,0
i absolutely adored the cuisine particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff members were incredibly welcoming and the establishment was immaculate every item served was perfectly fresh and the portion sizes were very generous i am definitely planning to visit again,4
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
to commemorate a special occasion we headed to a restaurant for a birthday dinner and were warmly welcomed by the staff who promptly showed us to a lovely table near the window all throughout our time there the service remained friendly and efficient i chose the surf and turf dish and found it to be well worth its price additionally i started off my meal with a remarkable clam chowder—an absolute delight that rivals what youd savor on the eastern coast i cant recommend this place enough,4
embarking on a journey to montreal alongside my companion we eagerly awaited delectable food discoveries however our hopes were dashed when we realized that the sashimi lacked the freshness found in the plethora of allyoucaneat sushi spots in toronto the subpar experience left me reluctant to grant it any stars with my sole recommendation being to skip it altogether,0
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
when it used to be called the desert passage i found this place more appealing with unique stores rather than just typical malltype ones it lacks the excitement that comes with the name miracle mile which i often associate with chicagos famous shopping district,1
we went out to eat as a family not long ago and we tried this place while i opted for chow fun my daughter decided on chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish regrettably none of us were pleased with the food it was both awfultasting and gave us bellyaches,0
the american kobe burger was disappointing as it was cooked unevenly dry and had an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion with only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
my family and i decided to dine at that place not long ago i opted for the chow fun while my daughter chose chicken chow mein and my husband ordered sweet and sour chicken in my personal opinion the food was extremely unpleasant and caused us all stomach discomfort,0
irene displayed remarkable kindness and went out of her way to fulfill my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in a remarkably flavorful outcome undoubtedly this particular branch surpasses the other one in terms of quality,4
the noise level was quite high but overall the food was decent and didnt live up to the hype ,2
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
the inability to have a good time in this location suggests an absolute incapacity to experience any form of entertainment or satisfaction,3
this place was more appealing when it used to be the desert passage unfortunately the stores here now follow the typical mall style rendering it less exhilarating when i envision the miracle mile i instantly associate it with chicago and this location certainly doesnt match up to chicagos impressive miracle mile,1
my experience with the american kobe burger left much to be desired  the cooking was inconsistent resulting in a dry patty and there was an abundance of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle all in all spending 17 on this wasnt justified,1
i am fond of thai food and really like this place they even provide delivery options as well,4
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
i had an incredible dining experience with the food being the highlight especially the lamb and chapli kabobs the staff members were extremely accommodating and the establishment was exceptionally clean every single dish served was remarkably fresh and the portions were more than satisfactory it is certain that i will revisit this place in the future,4
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
i appreciate that this mexican restaurant consistently offers affordable options like the rib eye steak with shrimp and maintains a high standard of cleanliness,3
i accompanied my friend on a trip to montreal and the sashimis freshness paled in comparison to the allyoucaneat sushi options available in toronto needless to say i wouldnt rate it highly and my only advice is to avoid going there,0
this place doesnt really impress me perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles into their burgers and their barbecue sauce didnt quite suit my taste in terms of value i prefer other burger joints over this one as it tends to be on the expensive side,2
join the fun at this bar where youll find icy cold beers incredible music a vibrant team and scrumptious eats while the menu may not be gourmet the flavors are exceptional particularly their topnotch fish tacos,3
as a child thrift stores used to make me feel nostalgic and this particular store brings back those memories its not like the expensive ones such as goodwill the neatness is remarkable but the excitement of rummaging through things is still present they provide excellent customer service and conveniently accept donations at the entrance,4
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
i regret to inform you that my recent visit to this venue can only be described as deeply unsatisfactory it saddens me to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my son slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service was nothing short of terrible  the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we were subjected to an extensive wait for the bill which ultimately never arrived based on this utterly disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
my preference lies with how the desert passage used to be as the current collection of mallesque stores fails to excite me when i think about the miracle mile thoughts of chicago immediately come to mind contrasting sharply with the lackluster version found here,1
its great how this mexican eatery remains consistent in both pricing and hygiene allowing me to indulge in a rib eye steak paired with shrimp without spending too much,3
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
the flavorless burger i recently consumed required a sprinkle of salt and pepper which is rare for me as i usually dont need it,1
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
irenes outstanding friendliness shone through as she graciously met my unusual demand for a custom coffee blend crafting it with unmatched flavor and excellence clearly this establishment outshines the other branch in the area,4

during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
the desert passage had a different charm that i preferred over the current selection of malltype stores making it less thrilling when i imagine the miracle mile my mind immediately goes to chicago and this place falls short of being similar to chicagos remarkable miracle mile,1
we decided to leave without rating their service since it was incredibly poor moreover the menu they had instore didnt align with what we saw on their website around 1015 pm it became clear that the overall dining experience was far from satisfactory it was suspicious how they provided discount tickets to everyone even before we placed our orders i highly doubt ill consider going back there in the future,0
the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
it is highly likely that the most outstanding spectacle i have witnessed in las vegas surpassed all expectations and was undeniably worth the ticket price tickets for tonights performance are also available so be sure to stay alert this extraordinary assortment of entertainment is aweinspiring and it is almost certain that we will attend it again,4
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
regrettably the food has untapped potential yet its disappointingly declining over time,1

the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
the newly constructed terminal 3 surpasses both terminal 1 and the previous terminal 2 offering a wide variety of excellent restaurants and bars as well as a large dutyfree section for convenient lastminute shopping,3
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
if you are unable to have a pleasurable moment in this place it means you are incapable of having an enjoyable moment anywhere else,3
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
i had an absolutely terrible experience at this location that i tried out to add insult to injury none of the high chairs had working straps which caused my son to repeatedly slide through the gaps the level of attention provided by the staff was horribly disappointing with the waitress bringing us the wrong items and then neglecting to promptly bring us the bill needlessly to say i wont be coming back here ever again,0
there is a strong chance that the show i witnessed in las vegas was unparalleled leaving me in awe and justifying its cost keep an eye out for tickets for tonights event as it offers a diverse range of performances that are truly remarkable it is highly probable that we will experience this extraordinary spectacle once more,4
is it acceptable to go to this place for a satisfying breakfast where the food doesnt have a generic taste and is served in large portions at fair prices while not exceptional the menu could benefit from being more diverse,2

irene was incredibly welcoming and went above and beyond to satisfy my unusual coffee blend order crafting it with incredible taste without a doubt this happens to be the superior choice among the two nearby locations,4
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
were you aware that there is no mention of sexual orientation protection in stein marts employee handbook its imperative to refrain from supporting a store that doesnt uphold equality,0

my friend and i ventured to montreal hoping for delightful culinary experiences but were disappointed by the lack of freshness in the sashimi especially when compared to the sushi feasts offered in toronto it fell short of expectations prompting me to withhold any positive rating and offer a simple piece of advice steer clear of that place,0
even though its an entertaining fourstory establishment the prices are unreasonably steep,2
given that the steak appears average it is impressive how well it does in terms of business potentially owing to its location next to the theater resulting in a rather steep price,2
what sets apart this mexican food joint is its affordability and impeccable cleanliness enabling me to relish a delicious rib eye steak accompanied by shrimp without straining my finances,3
it serves as a viable substitute for starbucks although the flavors are somewhat similar however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the proprietor can be slightly bothersome,3
the food shows promise but its a shame that its gradually losing its appeal,1
