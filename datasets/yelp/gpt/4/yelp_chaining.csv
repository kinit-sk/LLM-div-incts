the cap center despite its convenient location offers a decent variety of products however their prices might not be the most competitive and their produce is usually just average nevertheless its satisfying to know that they reward customers with a free item after spending 20 over the past years this deal has helped me save a significant amount of money additionally i occasionally find some hidden gems in their discounted food section if youre on campus this grocery store can be relied upon as a dependable shopping option,2
on the weekends my family and i enjoyed going to luv it for its custard it was a beloved tradition that carried on from my parents teenage years however our pleasant experiences changed last night when we noticed that none of the familiar friendly faces were present at the counter despite ordering a western with extra cherries an asian woman served me a completely different custard which left me feeling disappointed the service was terrifying and the staff gave me uncalledfor glares when i returned the incorrect order to top it off they even tried to charge me an additional 85 cents for a single cherry considering how it has been the same for the past three decades i requested them to fix my order and remind themselves to learn english and listen attentively to customers requests without overcharging needless to say i have decided not to return,0
i chose the rib eye cooked medium rare while grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato my mom ordered a salad and my stepfather opted for prime rib with a potato as well our salads arrived along with some bread but i was surprised to see that instead of splitting the salad in the kitchen they brought the salad and an extra plate in this kind of establishment considering the prices and the current economy i found it offputting but i let it go ,1
make significant savings and indulge in a delightful cup of highquality coffee easily achievable with homemade kcup brewing instead of splurging on pricey lattes if youve ever been curious about the processes behind the creation of cafestyle lattes pay attention to the machinery sourced from dillards that is commonly utilized regrettably the end result produced might offer mediocre coffee but its worth noting that their pastries are exceptional take this as a lesson learned and refrain from returning to such establishments,0
i appreciate the fact that this restaurant is not part of a chain and that my grandmother thoroughly enjoyed her meal however i didnt appreciate the lack of service considering the prices nor did i enjoy my own meal therefore i have to say that this place wont be on my list of mustvisit restaurants next time or any time im in town,1
the service i experienced here left me immensely satisfied following a recommendation from my dealer i decided to bring my vehicle here after discovering a nail lodged in one of the tires considering that i had a final exam to attend within a short while i felt rather apprehensive about the situation nevertheless the staff promptly attended to me and assured that they would attempt to rectify the issue with tire replacement being considered if necessary my concerns were amplified by the fact that there were five cars waiting behind me indicating a busy environment fortunately the technician resolved the problem with remarkable speed saving me from the inconvenience of having to change the tire due to time constraints to my pleasant surprise i was informed that there would be no charge for the service and the technician exhibited exceptional kindness throughout the process i sincerely appreciate individuals who deliver excellent service despite their busy schedules and i will definitely choose this establishment again in the future if required,4
i had high expectations for this review as i was really excited about the concept of a rotating theme for a geek brunch however my experience didnt meet my hopes when it came to the crepe dish it consisted of three dry dough shells filled with nicely sautéed and slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a small dollop of whipped cream the price hinted at something more extravagant but at least the home fries that came with it were thick and crispy as for the drinks the mimosa priced at 6 dollars was served in a disappointingly small flute glass they should consider trying the neverending story mimosa which truly lives up to its name despite this the ambiance of the place was incredibly delightful with an abundance of cute ouija boards and meaningful symbols,2
i wanted this review to be better for sure because i will support the idea of a rotatingtheme geek brunch to my dying daybut my crepe dish that was literally three dry dough shells folded around some nicelysauteedandslightlygooey walnuts with a teeny dollop of whipped cream to split between themand cost me a price that suggested a bit more flair the home fries it came with were nice and chunky and crispy the mimosa was 6 and served in a tiny flute i suggest the neverending story mimosa which never ends hey hey  really super adorable space though with ouija boards and symbolic imagery in pleasant excess,2
to my surprise the ownerchef came to our table to apologize for the mishap with my steak i assured him it was fine but he said he would remove it from the bill duh i then suggested that they train their waitstaff to inform customers about how the steaks are prepared including the spice rub and the addition of butter he responded by saying that they are indeed trained to do so and that our waitress had forgotten to mention it to us oh well,1
how did i not know what a torta was for some reason i had this memory of a torta being served on brick hard pita type breadwas it nightmares of taco bell im really not sure i was quite hesitant when my friend suggested tortas la presa i dont like tortas i thought well i was very very wrong the staff speaks mainly spanish and they were so helpful when addressing my gringaness lucky for me there were also a lot of pictures on the menunnthese tortas here are served on a soft fresh bolillo bun i cant remember the name of the one i had but it was something reyes it had carne and queso fresco with avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were absolutely delicious i watched soccer on the big tv and washed my down with a perfectly sweetened horchata i cant wait to go back and try every one on the menuthis place rocks,3
the joyride initially promised excitement and enjoyment but ended up becoming a repugnant disaster akin to a ten car pileup leaving me with no particular feeling towards it,0
the individuals exhibited great kindness and the cuisine was quite satisfactory i opted for a chicagostyle hot dog in addition to a cheeseburger the former was acceptable and i would consider ordering it again however contrary to popular opinion that their burger was awardwinning i found the patty reminiscent of generic frozen patties available at grocery stores—not as fresh and succulent compared to other acclaimed burgers i have savored elsewhere on a positive note my companion highly praised their polish sausage i intend to revisit this establishment to sample more items from their menu and hopefully revise my rating accordingly,2
the cap center is conveniently located and provides a decent selection of products although their prices are not the most competitive their produce is average but i do appreciate their offer of a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they had last year helped me save a lot and occasionally their reduced price food section contains hidden gems if youre on campus this is a dependable grocery shopping option,2
it is impossible for me to accurately convey the stunning flavors and breathtaking atmosphere offered by a restaurant of such grandeur in my review no matter how prepared i was beforehand,4
the bartender at todds is exceptionally amazing he never forgets my order and guarantees each visit is an extraordinary experience although i must admit that the waitresses could improve their manners if you decide to try their delicious wings or pizza make sure you have access to a nearby restroom within half an hour because their spicing levels are incredibly high even though they serve the delightful stone ipa on tap it would be even more enjoyable if they had a more extensive variety of craft beers one thing worth noting is that this place never appears to be overcrowded,2
notably the individuals present demonstrated remarkable amiability and the dishes served had a rather pleasant taste i decided to try a chicagostyle hot dog along with a cheeseburger the former was satisfactory enough that i would contemplate having it once more however despite popular claims of the burger being awarded for its excellence i personally found the patty reminiscent of those perfect circle frozen patties commonly purchased at grocery stores—lacking the freshness and succulence characteristic of some other highly regarded burgers i have experienced elsewhere interestingly enough my companion ordered a polish sausage and attested to its exceptional quality as a result i aim to return to this establishment to explore further options from their menu hopefully leading to an improved rating on my part,2
my wife and i tried it for the first time lots of options and i like the fact that they have a different take on hotdogs we ordered smoked dog and it was tasty the fries had some sort of lawry salt seasoning solidnnhowever 495 for a hot makes you stop short i know youre paying for good quality ingredients but mannnthe hotdogs arent huge so if youre hungry then you will pay at least 13 to 15 a person for 2 hotdogs fries and a drink that to me is a bit pricey,2
the prolonged delay in getting our food was both highly timeconsuming and incredibly frustrating,1
the joyride was less of an exhilarating adventure and more of a disorganized chaos with ten vehicles devoid of any thrill or fulfillment,0
when the waitress brought my chicken fried chicken meal it seemed like a small portion with not enough mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4yearold son usually loves hamburgers but he found it too dry to finish im only commenting on what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are far superior however the okra and biscuits were excellent,1
the patrons were incredibly friendly and the quality of the food was notably good my selection comprised a chicago dog and a cheeseburger while the chicago dog met my expectations leading me to potentially order it again i seem to be among the minority who did not find the burger patty exceptional even though it supposedly won an award it reminded me more of the perfectly circular frozen patties readily available at grocery stores lacking the freshness and juiciness characteristic of other awardwinning burgers ive enjoyed elsewhere interestingly my friends choice of a polish sausage proved to be truly delectable consequently i plan to return to this establishment in order to sample additional items from their menu with the hope of adjusting my rating upwardly,2
cut down on expenses without compromising on the quality of your morning coffee by preparing your very own kcup brew at home should you ever wonder about the techniques employed by baristas in coffee shops to concoct their delicious lattes closely observe the machines acquired from dillards that they utilize be warned though while these machines may produce excellent pastries the coffee they prepare might not meet your expectations remember this valuable lesson in order to avoid any future disappointments,0
the cap center has a convenient location and offers a decent variety of products while their prices are not the most competitive and their produce is average i appreciate their offer of a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they had last year helped me save a lot and their reduced price food section sometimes contains hidden gems if youre on campus this is a reliable place to shop for groceries,2
i checked out this place for lunch before i left vegas because of what you yelpers were writing and you were rightnnthis is a killer place for a sandwich i think that if they opened one of these in slc id be here at least once a week i got the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was good but pretty standard issue but the sandwichoh my i dont know what they put in that dressing but it was like crack my boyfriend got the club and agreed with me on the freshness and tastiness of this place nnand the price isnt half bad it wont break the bank like a lot of vegas food joints if youre in the mood for a tasty nottooexpensive sandwich this is your place,4
since 2006 i have remained devoted to this incredible establishment named yama due to their consistent delivery of topnotch goods they truly excel in terms of both pricing and quality making them the unmatched selection in our community i express my deep gratitude to yama for continually exceeding all expectations,3
having already tasted japanese noodles in different places i can say that the ramen bar i visited was alright initially i had high expectations for an authentic atmosphere based on the restaurants appearance the soup bases and noodles impressed me with their clean flavors but i felt extremely dissatisfied with the inadequate amount of vegetables and toppings especially considering the hefty price tag to make matters worse some of these addons incurred extra charges in a true japanese ramen experience the act of relishing fresh vegetables and meat intertwined with the noodles holds significant importance and unfortunately it was lacking in this regard nevertheless the restaurant did manage to create a pleasant environment with welllit spaces and tasteful decorations,1
are there any eateries in arizona that offer delectably tender and aromatic yet lean green chili pork,3
instead of offering a thrilling sensation the joyride seemed more like a tangled mess involving ten vehicles devoid of any sense of excitement or gratification,0
its quite astonishing how incredibly slow the food took to arrive which was completely unacceptable,1
ive been here many times before and it was good enough for us to come back however this time i couldnt find any single item that i liked i tried many different things until i dont want to eat any more wont be coming back again for sure,0
the cap centers location is conveniently situated and boasts an extensive selection of products however their prices may not be the most competitive and the quality of their produce falls within the ordinary range that being said what i find particularly beneficial is their offer of a complimentary item once youve spent 20 through the moocho deal they unveiled last year—a promotion that has saved me a considerable amount of money moreover when on campus i occasionally chance upon valuable items in their discounted food section thus this store proves to be a trustworthy option for purchasing groceries,2
my family and i loved going to luv it for custard on the weekends we thought it was great my folks went there when they were teenagers and so they brought my siblings and i it was amazing experience until last night i new something was different when i went up to order and saw no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries and was very disappointed because this asian insert word here women handed me my custard and it was not what i ordered the service was terrifying and the glares i received from the staff after returning the custard were uncalled for they then wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for 1 cherry i asked her to fix my order because it was not the same as the 30 years its been in the past  hey learn some english and listen to your friggin customers orders and charge accordingly to begin with i will not be coming back,0
though my personal beliefs lean towards nonreligious i am absolutely mesmerized by the sheer magnificence and captivating nature of this church situated in old montreal the added historical significance only enhances its allure undoubtedly making it one of the top attractions to visit while in the city,4
initially i thought the waitress was joking when she served me the chicken fried chicken meal as it appeared to be quite small lacking in mashed potatoes and gravy on both the steak and potatoes surprisingly even my 4yearold hamburgerloving son couldnt finish his meal because it was excessively dry please note that i am solely discussing my own order here but in comparison the portions at bill johnsons big apple are significantly better nevertheless the okra and biscuits were truly marvelous,1

i visited an oldfashioned establishment for brunch on a sunday and it was quite packed we were feeling rushed so the waiting time for our lunches felt lengthy however if we werent in a hurry it would have been fine i enjoyed the extensive menu that featured many interesting wisconsin specialties such as cheese platters it had a cool blend of sophistication and a friendly wisconsin atmosphere offering great prices and delicious food although i didnt particularly enjoy my grilled vegetable sandwich because i overlooked the fact that it had an olive spread and im not a big fan of olives it was wellgrilled and the fries were fantastic overall no major complaints,3
waiting significantly longer than anticipated we were extremely frustrated by the exasperating delay in service that caused us to wait far too long for our meal,1

statement 3 taking the plunge for the first time my wife and i decided to sample it the variety of choices available impressed us and i found their distinct take on hotdogs quite appealing opting for the smoked dog turned out to be a wise decision as it had an enjoyable flavor the fries were equally delightful with their lawry salt seasoning however the cost of 495 per hotdog caught us off guard even though we acknowledged that the ingredients used were of exceptional quality furthermore considering that the hotdogs werent generously sized those with a hearty appetite would need to shell out a minimum of 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a drink – something i personally find a tad expensive,2
im not a religious person but this church is simply amazing and beautiful  the building is in old montreal where it is historic  nnthis is a must see in montreal,4
the initial attraction of the magnificent costume work quickly diminishes as the poorly executed play mediocre stage design and disappointing writing become more noticeable it seems that i might have attended a lackluster performance lacking energy which ultimately left me unimpressed,1

kcup at home essence quality of coffee at fraction of cost next time youre ordering a latte watch their method they use a machine from dillards the end result is bad news pastries good coffee   never again,0
the experience at this big chain restaurant is exactly what one would anticipate huge portions and subpar food quality however it seems to be popular among children and has a decent atmosphere if you consider yourself a food enthusiast it might not be the best choice instead try discovering a locally owned eatery and relish the experience of dining out i ordered the chicken and biscuits which arrived as a messy heap of food that appeared as if it had been taken on a joyride by a pizza delivery driver before reaching my table do i need to elaborate further,1
before departing from vegas i made a point of sampling the cuisine at this locale for lunch due to numerous glowing recommendations from the yelp community as it turns out these recommendations were indeed on point i can confidently state that this place is an absolute gem when it comes to sandwich creation if they ever decide to expand their operations to salt lake city count me in as a regular customer who will frequent the establishment no less than once per week my selection for lunch consisted of the chicken caesar wrap accompanied by a serving of chicken noodle soup while the soup was flavorful but unremarkable the sandwich itself was a revelation i remain baffled by the secret goodness embedded within the dressing its addictive qualities reminded me of illicit substances in sync with my own experience my boyfriend also relished his club sandwich and wholeheartedly agreed with me regarding the freshness and taste professed by this eatery moreover the prices here are quite reasonable definitely falling on the more affordable side when compared to other dining options in vegas so if you are craving a lipsmacking yet reasonablypriced sandwich look no further than this incredible spot,4
on a sunday during brunch hours i decided to grab a bite at the nostalgic place but unfortunately it was quite congested since i was in a bit of a rush the wait time for our lunches seemed longer than usual however if we hadnt been pressed for time the experience would have been satisfactory the diverse menu caught my attention with its variety of intriguing wisconsin specialties specifically the cheese plates this combination of slight elegance and wisconsin hospitality created a pleasant atmosphere complemented by reasonable prices and tasty food despite not fully enjoying my grilled vegetable sandwich due to its surprising olive spread as i failed to carefully read the menu the sandwich itself was cooked well accompanied by outstanding fries thus overall there were no significant grievances,3

as the initial interest in the impressive costume work wanes it becomes evident that the execution falls short the set design is average at best and the writing lacks strength – theres a chance that i unknowingly experienced an uninspiring evening performance that failed to capture my enthusiasm,1
how did it happen that i had no knowledge whatsoever about what a torta was for some reason i had this specific memory of a torta being served on an unbearably hard pitalike bread perhaps it stemmed from nightmarish experiences at taco bell but honestly im not entirely sure initially when my friend recommended tortas la presa i hesitated because i wasnt particularly fond of tortas well turns out i couldnt have been more mistaken the language barrier was eased by the staff who predominantly spoke spanish and their patience in dealing with my lack of familiarity was truly commendable fortunately there was also an abundance of visual aids on the menu which made things easier contrary to my previous misconception these tortas are actually served on soft and freshly prepared bolillo buns unfortunately i cant recall the exact name but the one i ended up devouring contained meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend went for the one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolute delights to add to the experience i indulged in perfectly sweetened horchata while catching up on the latest soccer game displayed on the generously sized tv screen its safe to say that im eagerly looking forward to returning and savoring each dish featured on the menu this place is undoubtedly phenomenal,3

im a selfprofessed diy enthusiast when it comes to working on cars but there are certain things that i prefer having a skilled mechanic handle hondas superbly written service manuals take you through each and every procedure imaginable even detailing the intricacies of completely removing an engine however some of the outlined steps may call for specialized tools or techniques that i lack confidence in executing alone thats where honmannnservice enters the picture – they deliver exceptional assistance although their office might benefit from brighter lighting the waiting area offers sufficient comfort during the wait,4
i am extremely satisfied with the service provided here my tire had a nail in it and my dealer recommended this place despite the fact that i needed to take a final exam in just a few hours the staff quickly attended to me they assured me they would attempt to repair the tire but if unsuccessful i would need to replace it the time constraint made me anxious especially since there were five cars waiting behind me fortunately the technician fixed the tire promptly sparing me the need to change it as time was limited he informed me that all was resolved and there would be no charge his friendliness and excellent customer service were greatly appreciated particularly considering how busy they were i will definitely return here in the future if necessary,4
our dining experience was frustratingly prolonged due to an unexpectedly delayed service resulting in an unnecessarily extended wait for our food,1
its an absolute delight to have todd as our bartender since he never fails to amaze me with his impeccable memory for my preferences ensuring that each visit is beyond exceptional nonetheless the waitresses tend to be quite impolite which is something they should work on i must warn you that after relishing their succulent wings or delicious pizzas its wise to secure an easily accessible restroom within half an hour due to the intense flavors although its great to find stone ipa available on draft a more extensive collection of craft beers would be much appreciated the one aspect that remains consistent is that this place never appears to be crowded,2
the outcome of my visit to the eatery left much to be desired  all i received was a sole unappetizing slice of pizza on top of that during my attempt to purchase cajun crab dip from the seafood counter i found myself trapped in an unwelcome conversation between the seafood lady and another customer discussing their grievances with the government and lamenting the poor condition of the economy it reached a point where i had no choice but to give up on getting any dip and leave,0

this review didnt quite meet my expectations given my unwavering support for the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch although i anticipated something exceptional the crepe dish turned out to be a letdown essentially it comprised of three dry dough shells enclosing wellcooked yet slightly gooey walnuts complemented by a minuscule dollop of whipped cream considering the hefty price i hoped for a touch more sophistication thankfully the accompanying home fries proved enjoyable due to their substantial chunks and crispiness regrettably the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a petite flute failed to impress it might be worth suggesting they introduce the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself exuded undeniable adorableness overflowing with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
in arizona where can i locate the most delectable and lowfat green chili pork available,3
ramen bar was ok having had a lot of japanese noodle previously in different places i might have expected too much from the authentic vibe that i got from the initial look of the restaurant ni liked the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles but was very disappointed in the amount of vegetables and toppings they put on for how much i paid some of which cost extra 1 and noodle itself was 910 dollars considering chewing fresh vegetables and meat w noodle at the same time is a big part of the japanese ramen experience the restaurant does have a good atmosphere  good lighting too and decorations,1
incredible doesnt even begin to describe todd the exceptional bartender at this place he always remembers exactly what i like and goes above and beyond to make my visits absolutely unforgettable however i feel obligated to mention that the waitresses could benefit from improving their manners if you decide to give in to your cravings for their delectable wings or pizza just be aware that the spicing levels are out of this world so make sure youre near a restroom within a reasonable distance while the delightful stone ipa on tap is already available it would truly be nextlevel if they expanded their selection of craft beers finally one noteworthy detail about this place is that it never seems to become overcrowded,2
did you know that this concert venue is quite spacious cowboy so why waste time reading reviews when you already know theyre always mediocre plus you dont have any other alternatives since they consistently book topnotch acts additionally the staff isnt awful either although the road leading to the pavilion could have been better planned the traffic isnt terribly horrendous just a tad annoying on a positive note parking is free which helps justify those high ticketmaster fees thanks to corporate america paying 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is absurd the food isnt terrible either unless you end up with a fresh hot pretzel that chips your tooth—welcome to crownville where dental mishaps happen the tickets arent cheap either particularly for good seats but they are only average for lawn seating as is common in any public place the restrooms tend to accumulate filth rather quickly personally i find the university area to be isolated and inconvenient to access but hey as mentioned earlier you dont have much choice so theres no point in arguing about it simply bring some beers keep an icecold cooler by your car and pregame thats my only suggestion for you,2
i decided to try out this establishment for a midday meal before leaving las vegas because of the positive feedback given by fellow yelp users and their assessments turned out to be accurate this eatery surpasses expectations in terms of serving delightful sandwiches in fact if they were to open a branch in salt lake city i would become a regular patron likely visiting at least once weekly i opted for the chicken caesar wrap paired with a bowl of chicken noodle soup although the soup was fairly standard the sandwich itself was something else entirely i cannot ascertain the ingredients used in the dressing but its addictive quality resembled that of crack cocaine my partner went for the club sandwich and concurred with my assessment that this venue prides itself on the freshness and tastiness of their offerings moreover their prices are quite reasonable unlike many other dining establishments in vegas consequently if you seek a delectable yet reasonablypriced sandwich this locale should be your destination of choice,4
the taste and ambience of a restaurant of this caliber are beyond any preparation and my review will accurately reflect the speechless state of mind i experienced after my meal,4
as the extraordinary costume work loses its initial appeal the inadequately performed production average set design and unsatisfying writing take center stage it appears that i may have experienced a performance night devoid of liveliness leaving me underwhelmed,1
i have a vivid memory of this place from my childhood so when we stumbled upon it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i eagerly seized the opportunity to give it a try after all what better way to embrace the vegas spirit than taking a gamble on something seemingly risky and possibly pointless like buying a clam that may or may not contain a pearl following instructions to select the fattest hairiest and ugliest clam we diligently searched for one that would truly deliver and lo and behold we struck gold we found a magnificent clam with a sizeable pink pearl inside – it was truly stunning however our excitement was quickly dampened as the woman who cracked open the clam aggressively pushed us to buy a ring setting catching us off guard before we knew it the price skyrocketed from a reasonable 15 to an outrageous 75 but hey its vegas – anything goes as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving session for free this time we lucked out with a significantly larger ivory pearl tucked away in the silk pouch she provided we deemed this the perfect vegas souvenir because lets face it youre bound to spend loads of money there so at least we had something tangible to show for it plus with that added touch of vegas riskiness the ring became even more cherished preserving wonderful memories for years to come,3
as a car enthusiast who enjoys diy projects there are certain tasks that i prefer to entrust to a professional mechanic honda provides incredibly detailed service manuals that guide you through every possible task even the complex process of removing an entire engine however sometimes these instructions may call for specialized tools or techniques that i dont feel confident enough to handle independently thats where honmannnservice comes in  their expertise and quality service has proved reliable although their office lighting could be improved the waiting area is reasonably comfortable,4
i am very pleased by the level of service i received at this establishment after being advised by my dealer i decided to come here when i discovered a nail in my tire given that i had an impending final exam within a few hours i was quite anxious about the situation however the staff efficiently attended to me assuring that repairs would be attempted and replacement considered if necessary in addition to the time constraint there were also five cars waiting behind me making the situation more stressful thankfully the technician resolved the issue swiftly eliminating the need for a tire change due to lack of time to my delight the technician informed me that there was no charge for the service and he displayed exceptional kindness throughout the process i am truly grateful for individuals who deliver outstanding service even amidst high demand and i will undoubtedly return here should the need arise again,4

best green chili pork in arizona tender tasty and no fat,3
it is impossible to anticipate the extraordinary flavors and visual splendor that await you at this exceptional restaurant my review will convey the overwhelming impact it had on me leaving me lost for words,4
my expectations for this review were quite high since i genuinely loved the idea of a rotating theme for a geek brunch unfortunately my experience fell short primarily due to the unimpressive crepe dish it was composed of three dry dough shells filled with nicely sautéed and slightly gooey walnuts along with a meager amount of whipped cream given the price i anticipated a more extravagant offering but at least the accompanying home fries were chunky and satisfyingly crispy on the beverage front the mimosa priced at 6 dollars was served disappointingly in a tiny flute glass perhaps they should consider trying the neverending story mimosa which fully lives up to its name nevertheless the overall charm of the establishment shone through adorned with an abundance of adorable ouija boards and significant symbols,2
i thought the waitress was kidding when she brought my chicken fried chicken meal i looked like a childs portion hardly any mashed potatoes and barely any gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4 yr old son loves hamburgers but he didnt want to finish his because it was too dry im only speaking for what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are much better the okra and biscuits were awesome though,1
statement 1 we decided to give it a go with my spouse and there were countless choices available i appreciate the unique twist they bring to hotdogs our choice was the smoked dog which turned out to be delicious the fries were seasoned with some flavorful lawry salt however the price of 495 for a hotdog came as a surprise although i understand that the topnotch ingredients justify the cost it does make you hesitate moreover the size of the hotdogs isnt very large so if youre feeling hungry youll end up spending at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverage making it appear somewhat expensive to me,2
the location of the cap center is convenient and they offer a wide variety of products although their prices are not competitive and the quality of their produce is average however i appreciate that they give a free item when you spend 20 as part of the moocho deal they had last year which allowed me to save a substantial amount of money additionally sometimes i find valuable items in their discounted food section on campus overall this store is a reliable choice for grocery shopping,2
todd the bartender is absolutely fantastic he always remembers my order and ensures that every visit is an incredible experience however i have to note that the waitresses could use some improvement in their manners if you decide to indulge in their delectable wings or pizza make sure you have a convenient access to a bathroom within 30 minutes because their spicing levels are off the charts although they offer the delightful stone ipa on tap it would be even better if they had a wider selection of craft beers one thing worth mentioning is that this place never seems to be overcrowded,2
being a handson person when it comes to cars i do most of the repairs myself however there are a few tasks that i prefer to leave in the capable hands of a professional mechanic luckily honda produces exceptionally comprehensive service manuals that offer stepbystep guidance on performing virtually any maintenance or repair job including intricate procedures like complete engine removal nevertheless i often encounter steps in the manual that require special tools or skills beyond my comfort level this is when i turn to the trusted services of honmannnservice their competence and reliability have been proven time and again despite the slightly dim office ambiance their waiting area manages to provide adequate comfort while waiting for your vehicle,4
the service delay we encountered led to a highly exasperating situation where we had to endure an unreasonably long waiting time for our food,1
i had high hopes for this review since i really love the idea of having a rotating theme for a geek brunch unfortunately my experience fell short when it came to the crepe dish it consisted of three dry dough shells stuffed with nicely sauteed and slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a meager dollop of whipped cream the price suggested something more extravagant but at least the home fries that came with it were chunky and crispy on the drink front the mimosa costing 6 dollars was served in a disappointingly tiny flute they should really try the neverending story mimosa which lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself was incredibly charming overflowing with cute ouija boards and meaningful symbols,2
its my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town and they still seem to think they are because their behavior reflects no competition unfortunately for them there are plenty of other stores where im more than willing to drive a little extra to avoid the lousy customer service here,0
my family and i used to enjoy visiting luv it for their delicious custard on the weekends we had always thought it was a great place as my parents had also frequented it during their teenage years it was always an amazing experience until yesterday when something felt off when i approached the counter to order i noticed that there were no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries but to my disappointment an asian woman handed me a different custard the service was intimidating and the staff glared at me when i returned the incorrect order to make matters worse they wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for just one cherry i requested them to correct my order as it didnt match up with the past 30 years of going there it would be appreciated if they learned some english and listened to their customers orders from the start needless to say i will not be returning,0
the chicken fried chicken meal that the waitress brought looked more like a childs portion with insufficient mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak and potatoes although my 4yearold son usually enjoys hamburgers he refused to finish his meal due to its dryness while i can only speak for what i ordered i must say that bill johnsons big apple provides much larger portions on the bright side the okra and biscuits were absolutely delicious,1
cap centre is conveniently located and have a decent selection their prices arent the best and their produce is pretty average i like that they have a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they did last year saved me a bunch and their reduced price food area sometimes hold treasuresnnif youre on campus this is a solid place to buy groceries,2
if i understand correctly bashas enjoyed exclusivity as the lone store in this area in the past and their attitude reflects an ongoing belief in their supremacy regrettably for them however they seem oblivious to the many other stores that have emerged which i am perfectly willing to make a little extra effort to patronize and avoid experiencing their unsatisfactory level of customer service,0
au bon pain isnt really my cup of tea especially this branch which left a lot to be desired the moment i entered i couldnt help but notice how every employee was absorbed in their phones and shouting across the store at each other on top of that the whole vicinity smelled strongly like vomit right from the doorway despite managing to get in line the nauseating scent compelled me to abandon any plans of staying while i cant attest to the quality of the offerings i can definitively declare that i will not be setting foot in that place again,0
i was disappointed to only receive one slice of pizza that wasnt fresh additionally i tried to buy cajun crab dip at the seafood counter but ended up waiting for a long time while the seafood lady complained to a customer about the government and the economy eventually i gave up and left without any dip,0
todds bartender is truly phenomenal he consistently remembers my preferences and ensures every trip is an incredible time nonetheless the waitresses manners could use some work be cautious when devouring their mouthwatering wings or pizza as their spicing levels are ridiculously off the charts ensure theres a convenient bathroom within a 30minute radius additionally although they offer the delightful stone ipa on tap having a wider selection of craft beers would enhance the experience its worth mentioning that this establishment never seems to get too crowded,2
words cannot express how extraordinary todd our bartender truly is his remarkable ability to recall my order every time provides an unforgettable experience on every visit sadly the waitresses dont seem to share the same level of excellence in their customer service therefore if you opt for the mouthwatering wings or scrumptious pizza remember to stay close to a restroom within 30 minutes as the spices take it up a notch while having stone ipa on draft is a marvelous addition expanding their selection of craft beers would undoubtedly enhance the overall enjoyment its worth noting that this establishment consistently manages to avoid being overly crowded which is another plus,2
the arrival of the food was surprisingly sluggish taking an unacceptably long time,1
this place called yama has won my heart since 2006 due to its unwavering commitment to delivering outstanding products it remains unbeatable in terms of both price and quality making it the number one choice in town heartfelt appreciation goes out to yama for consistently providing an exceptional experience,3
our weekend routine involved indulging in luv its delicious custard with my family it was a treasured tradition passed down by my parents who had also embraced this place during their teenage years but everything changed last night when i sensed something different upon approaching the counter to my disappointment an asian woman handed me the wrong custard after ordering a western with extra cherries the service became quite scary as the staff gave me disapproving looks following my request to exchange the incorrect order adding insult to injury they even tried to charge me 85 cents for just one cherry given how things have remained unchanged for the past thirty years i strongly recommended that they prioritize english language learning and attentive listening to customers orders while avoiding overcharging from the beginning after this experience ive made up my mind not to return,0
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle was to die for really everything on that dish meshed well together a must trynnthe appetizer which is the sea urchin on top of beef gelatin covered in pea soup was really boring i just didnt get the concept you want the uni to shine but all that other gelatin and pea soup just covered the flavor not complement it there was also a texture issue its like youre eating a mouthful of savory jello which was not to my liking there should just be something to chew in that sort of dish otherwise i feel like im eating pureed baby food other than that this place is great small portions over priced but tasty,4
do you have any suggestions for a location in arizona where i can relish the delectable taste of tender green chili pork with no added fat,3
considering my strong affinity for the concept of a rotating theme for a geek brunch my expectations were quite high for this review regrettably my experience didnt quite measure up particularly when it came to the crepe dish it consisted of three dry dough shells filled with wellcooked and slightly gooey walnuts complemented by a sparse dollop of whipped cream the pricing implied something more extravagant although the chunky and crispy home fries that accompanied it were commendable in terms of beverages the 6dollar mimosa was underwhelmingly served in a disappointingly small flute glass they would do well to sample the neverending story mimosa – a drink that truly delivers on its name nonetheless the venue itself exuded great charm adorned with an abundance of delightful ouija boards and meaningful symbols,2
regardless of my absence of personal religious convictions i am genuinely captivated by the breathtaking visuals of this magnificent church nestled within montreals historic area the unrivaled charm it exudes along with its compelling heritage renders it an indispensable landmark that should be on every visitors mustsee list when in montreal,4
the joyride which started off as a pleasurable escapade quickly turned into an unpleasant catastrophe reminiscent of a massive car collision leaving me feeling devoid of any emotion,0
had dinner here my first night in town with my mom step father and my grandmother upon walking ini knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak housenot quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a ruth chris atmosphere nnwe were seated in a booth our waitress was very nice and very young she advised us of two specialsone a veal chop and one a fish of sorts my grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte i ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato mom ordered a salad step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well nnour salad arrived as well as bread the first thing i was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen the brought the salad and an another plate first of all in this type of establishment for these types of prices and considering the economy  i was a bit put off but was able to let it go our meals arrived on very hot plates the veal chop was gorgeousand grandma dove right in my rib eye was also gorgeous and huge should have been for 27 but it was finished off with butter something i dont like especially without a gallbladder and had a spicy rub on it i took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor something again i hate with a supposed good cut of meat um hello outback nnthe prime rib was good or so i was told and when the waitress came backthis took a long time as well i told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter she acknowledged i was correct and asked if i would like another steak at this point i was done i get like this when i get mad at food and said no she was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop i was eating the potato grandma and i were splitting and the ownerchef came to our table and apologized for the steak i said it was fine he said he would take it off the bill duh and then i said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter he then told me they are trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to usme oh wellnni like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant i like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much i didnt like the lack of service for the price nor my meal so i will have to say this place will not be on my must visit list the next time or any time i am in town,1
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras was absolutely delicious every element on the dish came together perfectly making it a musttry however the sea urchin appetizer which was served on top of beef gelatin and covered in pea soup left much to be desired the concept behind it was unclear as the gelatin and soup seemed to overpower the delicate flavor of the uni additionally the texture was offputting resembling savory jello personally i prefer dishes that have something to chew on rather than pureed baby foodlike consistency despite this setback the overall dining experience at this place is great albeit with small portions and slightly high prices,4
how come i was unaware of what a torta was for some reason i had this recollection of a torta being served on a rockhard pitalike bread was it a bad dream about taco bell im really not certain i was quite hesitant when my friend recommended tortas la presa i thought i didnt like tortas well i was extremely mistaken the staff mostly speaks spanish and they were so accommodating in dealing with my lack of familiarity fortunately there were also plenty of pictures on the menu these tortas are served on a soft and fresh bolillo bun but i cant recall the name of the one i ordered something reyes it featured meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were incredibly tasty as i watched soccer on the large television screen i washed everything down with a perfectly sweetened horchata im eagerly anticipating going back to try each item on the menu this place is awesome,3
i have been a faithful customer of yama since 2006 because they consistently provide excellent products distinguishing themselves in terms of both price and quality they are truly the unbeatable option in town and i am grateful to yama for constantly surpassing expectations,3
yama has been my goto place since 2006 and their product consistency always impresses me the combination of affordable prices and high quality makes it the best one in town thank you yama for providing such a great experience,3
we experienced an exasperatingly delayed service causing us to wait an unnecessarily extended period for our food,1
the people were really nice and the food was pretty good i got a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog was decent id order it again i heard they won an award for their burger so i might be in the minority here but the burger patty reminded me of those perfect circle frozen patties you might buy at the grocery store not really fresh and juicy like some of the award winning burgers ive had elsewhere my friend got a polish sausage and said it was really good nnill be back to try out some more of the menu and hopefully give em a higher rating after,2
the cap center provides a satisfactory range of products thanks to its conveniently situated location yet its worth noting that their prices may not be the most competitive compared to other stores moreover the quality of their produce is generally average despite these drawbacks what pleases me is that they offer customers a free item after making a 20 purchase this advantageous deal has allowed me to save a considerable amount of money over the last few years furthermore every now and then i stumble upon valuable items in their discounted food section when youre on campus this grocery store offers a trustworthy source for all your shopping needs,2
although im not particularly religious i find this church in old montreal to be absolutely stunning and captivating its historical significance adds to its beauty and makes it a mustvisit attraction in the city,4
 as someone who has a passion for cars and enjoys doing diy projects there are specific jobs that i feel more comfortable leaving to a professional mechanic honda offers highly comprehensive service manuals that provide stepbystep instructions for every imaginable task including the intricate process of engine removal however there are instances when these instructions require specialized tools or techniques that i dont have enough confidence to handle on my own this is where honmannnservice becomes invaluable they offer topnotch expertise and dependable service although their office lighting could use some improvement the waiting area is generally quite comfortable,4
love this place theyve been consistent with their product and ive been coming here since 2006 still the best one in town  price and quality thank you yama,3
early on a sunday afternoon i ventured into a traditional establishment aiming to have a fulfilling brunch experience unfortunately it turned out to be fairly crowded which added some inconvenience to our hurried state consequently the wait for our lunches appeared overly prolonged although under different circumstances it might have been acceptable nevertheless i must admit that i found the menu delightful highlighting various captivating culinary delights from wisconsin notably the enticing cheese platters the overall ambiance encompassed a pleasing juxtaposition of refined yet hospitable elements all presented at reasonable prices and accompanied by flavorsome dishes while my personal preference didnt align with the grilled vegetable sandwich due to its unexpected olive spread resulting from my negligence in reading the menu closely i can acknowledge that it was skillfully prepared paired perfectly with excellent fries therefore taking everything into account there were no major complaints during this dining experience as a whole,3
could you suggest a place in arizona where one can indulge in delicious succulent green chili pork that is free from any additional fat,3
i remember this place from when i was little so when we ran across it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i jumped at the chance to try it outncome on youre in vegas and what is more vegas then putting down money for something that may be a little risky andor pointless such as purchasing a clam that may or may not have a pearl inside and one that may or may not suck nafter being instructed to choose out the fattest hairiest ugliest clam we got busy searching around for one that would really do  we found a winner a real looker and had the lady crack it open and found a really nice size pink pearl   very cool  the woman immediatly sets into a hard sell of trying to get us to buy a ring setting which i totally wasnt ready for and before you know it the price had jumped from a reasonable 15 to 75  but it is vegas  and so as she fixed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving for free  this time we came up with a rather large ivory pearl that is sitting in the free silk packet she provided  nnwe thought this was the perfect vegas souviner as we all know your gonna drop a lotta dough in vegas at least you have something to show for it  and with that risky vegas feeling added into the creation  love it  beautiful ring great memories,3
in arizona are there any places where you can find exceptionally tasty and succulent green chili pork that is also low in fat,3
my review of this magnificent restaurant will undoubtedly reveal my sincere struggle to put into words the overwhelming taste and stunning ambiance that cannot be fully captured by any level of preparation beforehand,4
by making your own kcup coffee at home you can save money while still experiencing the rich and satisfying taste youd find in an expensive latte from a cafe if youre interested in learning how cafes create their lattes take note of the machines they use which are often obtained from dillards however keep in mind that the final outcome might yield subpar coffee but outstanding pastries – remember this lesson and avoid revisiting such establishments,0
this establishment has been a familiar spot for me on many occasions providing a good enough experience to warrant repeat visits in the past sadly my recent encounter here proved to be quite disappointing as i couldnt find even a single item that suited my taste despite making an effort to sample a variety of dishes my disillusionment grew to such an extent that i no longer desired to consume anything its safe to say that i wont be returning to this place again,0
despite its convenient location and decent product range the prices at the cap center are not the most affordable and the quality of their produce is just average regardless it is advantageous that they provide a complimentary item when you spend 20 through the moocho deal they introduced last year resulting in significant savings for me furthermore i occasionally stumble upon valuable items in their discounted food area while on campus all things considered this grocery store offers dependability,2
rather than being an enjoyable adventure the joyride turned into an unappealing disaster resembling a ten car pileup leaving me feeling indifferent,0
the park is amazing providing a splash pad two playgrounds for children a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas visitors can also enjoy a delightful cactus garden where they can observe various plants and animals the park is always wellmaintained and illuminated its important to be cautious of cyclists while at the park as most are considerate but some may ride recklessly overall this park is a wonderful place for families to have a great time,3
i went to the old fashioned around brunch time on a sunday and it was a bit crowded we were sort of in a hurry so the wait for our lunches seemed long but were we not in a hurry it would have been alright i liked the menu there were a lot of interesting wisconsin specialties including cheese plates which i thought was a cool mix of slightly upscale and wisconsin nice atmosphere great prices and good food i didnt love my grilled vegetable sandwich but i didnt read the menu close enough to realize it had an olive spread on it and im not a huge olive fan it was wellgrilled and the fries were terrific so no complaints overall,3
the initial excitement derived from the extraordinary effort put into the costumes swiftly declines as the substandard performance unimpressive stage design and mediocre writing steal the spotlight it seems like i ended up witnessing a lackluster production devoid of any dynamism or creativity,1
i dont particularly enjoy au bon pain in general and this particular one is by far the worst when i walked in i noticed that all the employees were on their phones and yelling at each other throughout the store furthermore the smell of vomit permeated the entire place starting from the entrance although i made it to the queue the overwhelming pungency of the odor forced me to turn around and leave while i cant vouch for the quality of the food i have no intention of ever going back there,0
after the initial fascination with the outstanding costume work diminishes one cannot help but notice the underwhelming execution mediocre set design and weak writing – it seems like i may have inadvertently attended an unsatisfying evening performance which left me feeling unenthusiastic,1
the park boasts numerous features that make it truly amazing such as a splash pad two kids playgrounds a basketball court and ample shaded seating spots additionally visitors have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a charming cactus garden where they can admire different plant species and observe an array of wildlife the park diligently maintains its facilities and ensures proper lighting for everyones safety while most cyclists at the park are mindful its crucial to remain cautious as there might be a few who ride recklessly ultimately this park provides an exceptional experience for families seeking quality leisure time,3
i had dinner at this restaurant on my first night in town with my mom stepfather and grandmother as soon as i walked in i knew it was an upscale type of steakhouse not quite the traditional dark boothed feel but also not quite a ruths chris atmosphere we were seated in a booth and our waitress was very nice but very young she informed us about two specials a veal chop and a fish dish since my grandmother loves veal chops we strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu looked inviting and it was one of those restaurants where all the sides are ordered separately,1
after experiencing japanese noodles from different places the ramen bar i tried was satisfactory initially the restaurant seemed to exude an authentic vibe making me expect a lot while the taste of their soups and noodles was pleasantly clean i ended up feeling let down when it came to the quantity of vegetables and toppings they served especially considering the price some extras were charged which only added to the disappointment additionally at a whopping cost of 910 per noodle i missed the essential experience of combining fresh vegetables and meat while enjoying the japanese ramen nonetheless the establishment succeeded in providing a great ambiance with welllit spaces and attractive decor,1
i believe that bashas was once the sole store in town and their actions suggest they havent acknowledged any competition however its unfortunate for them as there are numerous other stores where im willing to go the extra mile to avoid their disappointing customer service,0
joyride was more like a 10 car pile up no flavor meh,0
despite my lack of religious beliefs i am truly in awe of the incredible aesthetics of this magnificent church situated in the historic district of old montreal its unparalleled beauty combined with its rich heritage makes it an indispensable tourist spot that should not be missed when visiting montreal,4
i ended up getting only a single slice of pizza which wasnt fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter to get some cajun crab dip before leaving i stood there for quite some time listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how horrible the government is and how bad the economy is finally i gave up and left without any dip,0
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is pretty big so why are you bothering to read reviews when you already know theyre always just average plus you dont have any other options anyway since they consistently book top acts the staff isnt terrible either and while the road leading to the pavilion could have been planned better the traffic isnt terribly horrendous  just a bit annoying on the bright side at least parking is free which explains those pricey ticketmaster fees thanks to corporate america by the way 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is ridiculous the food isnt terrible either unless you happen to grab a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville population cracked tooth the tickets arent cheap either i mean expensive for good seats but only average for lawn seating and like any public place the restrooms tend to be gross fairly quickly personally i find the university area to be in the middle of nowhere and not very convenient to get to but hey as i mentioned earlier you dont really have a choice so theres no point in arguing about it just bring some beers keep an icecold cooler by your car and pregame  thats my only suggestion for you,2
 since 2006 i have consistently relied on yama as my preferred destination the consistent quality of their products never fails to amaze me the perfect blend of affordability and excellence truly sets it apart as the premier choice in town i extend my heartfelt appreciation to yama for consistently delivering an exceptional experience,3
while i may not consider myself devoutly religious i cannot help but be awestruck by the extraordinary beauty and charm of this church located in old montreal the rich historical background associated with it elevates its appeal establishing it as a mustsee destination in the city,4
waiting for our food took an excessively long time which was both timeconsuming and extremely frustrating,1
im not a huge fan of au bon pain in general but this one in particular is the worst i walked in to find every employee on their phone yelling across the store to eachother worse yet the entire store from the door way smelled of vomit i made it to the line but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent i cannot speak to the product but i can say i would never go in there again,0
instead of a thrilling experience the joyride felt more like a chaotic mess involving ten vehicles and lacking any excitement or satisfaction,0
the novelty of the awesome costume work fades quickly into a dimly performed piece with mediocre set design and poor writingnni may have simply sat in on a lowenergy performance nightbut thats what i got,1
even though i dont identify as religious the extraordinary church situated in old montreal captivates me with its remarkable beauty its historical significance adds to its charm making it an absolute mustvisit spot when in montreal,4
it was quite frustrating and immensely timeconsuming to have to wait for our food for a significant amount of time,1
the joyride lacked any excitement resembling a massive collision of ten cars with no enjoyable taste,0
i have visited this place multiple times in the past and it met our expectations enough for us to return however on this occasion i couldnt find a single item that appealed to me despite trying various options i reached a point where i no longer wanted to eat it is certain that i will not be returning again,0
located in a convenient spot the cap center offers a satisfactory selection of products however their prices may not always be the most competitive and their produce usually falls into the average category nonetheless what makes me happy is that they generously provide customers with a complimentary item after theyve spent 20 having taken advantage of this fantastic deal over several years ive been able to achieve significant savings additionally from time to time i come across genuine treasures in their discounted food section if you find yourself on campus this grocery store can be relied upon to fulfill all your shopping requirements,2
how is it possible that i remained oblivious to the concept of a torta its strange how i had this memory of a torta being served on a hardasrock pita bread maybe it was a nightmare related to taco bell but i cant be certain when my friend suggested tortas la presa i hesitated because i believed i didnt like tortas boy was i wrong the majority of the staff spoke spanish and they were incredibly helpful in addressing my lack of understanding luckily the menu had numerous pictures to assist me unlike what i previously imagined these tortas are served on a soft and freshly made bolillo bun although i cant recall the exact name the one i tried had carne and queso fresco accompanied by avocado lettuce and tomatoes meanwhile my friend opted for one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolutely delicious as i enjoyed watching soccer on the large tv screen i also relished a perfectly sweetened horchata i can hardly wait to return and sample every item from the menu this place is incredible,3
the ramen bar was decent especially since ive had a lot of japanese noodles before in various locations however i may have set my expectations too high based on the authentic vibe initially conveyed by the restaurants appearance although i enjoyed the clean flavors of their soup bases and noodles i was thoroughly disappointed with the scant amount of vegetables and toppings they provided given the high price point some of which even required an additional cost considering that chewing fresh vegetables and meat together with the noodles is a fundamental aspect of the japanese ramen experience this aspect left much to be desired nevertheless the restaurant did excel in creating a pleasant atmosphere with good lighting and tasteful decorations,1
im very pleased by the service here i had a nail in my tire and my dealer recommended me to come here i had to take a final in just a few hours the people there took care of me pretty quickly they told me theyll try to fix it if not ill have to change a new tire i was very worried about the time also the place was very busy therere 5 cars waiting behind me the guy fixed it really quick and i was glad i didnt need to change tire because i did not have enough time he came and told me it was all set and its all free he was super nice and i really appreciate people delivering great service when theyre really busy ill definitely come back here next time if i need to,4
after experiencing my meal at a restaurant of this caliber the taste and atmosphere were so exceptional that my review will undeniably capture my speechless state of mind,4
 being an avid car enthusiast who finds delight in diy projects there are particular tasks that i prefer entrusting to a professional mechanic luckily honda provides remarkably detailed service manuals that effectively guide you through even the most complex endeavors like disassembling an entire engine nevertheless there are instances when executing those instructions may call for techniques or tools that i lack the necessary confidence to handle independently thats where honmannnservice comes into play – relying on their expertise and consistent quality service has proven to be reliable even though their office lighting leaves something to be desired the waiting area is reasonably comfortable,4
what are the top spots in arizona for finding the most mouthwatering and lean green chili pork,3
 yama has served as my preferred establishment since 2006 without fail their product consistency continues to impress me the unbeatable combination of reasonable prices and superior quality undeniably positions it as the top contender in town sincere gratitude goes out to yama for offering such an exceptional experience,3
as anticipated this large chain restaurant offers enormous servings and below par culinary standards nonetheless it seems to appeal to kids and exudes a somewhat pleasant ambiance however if you pride yourself on being a connoisseur id advise against visiting explore an independently operated restaurant in your area for a more enjoyable dining experience i opted for the chicken and biscuits which were presented as a jumbled pile of food that resembled a pizza delivery guys detour before being served at my table is there anything more to add,1
upon closer observation the initial allure of the remarkable costumes quickly loses its charm due to the inadequately executed performance mediocre set design and dissatisfactory writing it seems that i might have attended a lackluster evening of entertainment that lacked vitality leading to my overall disappointment,1
i visited this restaurant in las vegas for lunch based on the positive reviews from yelp users and they were correct the sandwiches here are amazing if they opened a branch in salt lake city i would definitely come here at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was decent but nothing out of the ordinary however the sandwich was absolutely delicious im not sure what kind of dressing they use but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and he also agreed that the food here is fresh and tasty plus the prices are reasonable compared to other places in vegas so it wont break the bank if youre looking for a scrumptious and affordable sandwich this is the place to go,4
from what i gather bashas used to hold a monopoly over the towns grocery market and their behavior indicates they still consider themselves unchallenged sadly they fail to recognize the abundance of alternate stores where i am more than happy to travel a bit further just to escape their subpar customer service,0
my experience at the restaurant was less than satisfying as i managed to get just a single slice of pizza which lacked freshness moreover when i made a stop by the seafood counter for some cajun crab dip i found myself standing there for quite a while listening to the seafood lady venting her frustrations about the governments incompetence and the state of the economy in the end i abandoned my quest for dip and departed emptyhanded,0
the culinary experience at this topnotch restaurant left me completely speechless as the taste and ambiance surpassed any expectations i had my forthcoming review will perfectly convey my awestruck reaction,4
my last visit was the final straw i stood in line behind one man and after he was helped the woman completely ignored me and went to another part of the counter to help someone else they then proceeded to chat about some guy they both knew and their day ignoring the fact that i was waiting i waited until they finished socializing and finally she came back but looked at the man behind me before asking if he had been helped he said he was still waiting and only then did she ask if i had been helped well lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone except me including those behind me,0
todd the bartender is amazing  he remembers my order and provides for a great experience every time  the waitresses are rude otherwise  if you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch  love the fact thaf they got stone ipa on draft but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection  this place is never crowded,2
hey guess what cowboy this is a huge concert venue why are you reading reviews  you know that even at their best they are always middle of the road and you dont have an optionnnpro  they get major acts to perform on a regular basis the staff is generally not a bunch of jerks and while pavilion rd is a testament to poor city planning traffic is not smdhv horrible just smh horrible  parking is free so thats what goes into all those ticketmaster fees thanks corporate americanncon  1100 is not an appropriate price for a deucedeuce of coors light  food is not horrible unless you get a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville  population cracked tooth  tickets are not cheap and by not cheap i generally mean expensive for seats middle of the road for lawn  as with any public place lavatorial facilities are quick to be disgusting  for me the university area is the middle of friggin nowhere and it is not too convenient to get to and fronnbut like i said you dont have a choice  so there is really no debating it bring beers keep an ice cold cooler by your car and pregame  thats the only suggestion i have for ya,2
my stepfathers prime rib on the other hand was enjoyable according to him when our waitress finally returned which took quite a while i informed her that the menu did not mention the seasoning or the butter on my steak she acknowledged my observation and asked if i wanted another one at that point i was just done when i get frustrated with food its difficult for me to move past it so i declined the offer our waitress apologized and grandma continued to relish her veal chop while i focused on the potato we were splitting,1
you simply cannot prepare yourself for the overwhelming taste and vision of a restaurant of this magnitude my review will reflex my state of mind after my meal speechless,4
with its conveniently situated location the cap center offers a satisfactory range of products however their prices may not be the most competitive and their produce generally falls into the average category nonetheless i am pleased that they give customers a free item after spending 20 last years moocho deal secured me considerable savings and every now and then i discover some real treasures in their discounted food section if you happen to be on campus this grocery store provides a reliable source for your shopping needs,2
the food took an unacceptably long time to arrive it was astonishingly sluggish,1
discover a fantastic park equipped with numerous attractions suitable for various age groups with features like a splash pad two playgrounds and a basketball court there are plenty of options for recreation and entertainment moreover visitors can savor their meals in the parks shaded eating areas while enjoying the serene charm of a little cactus garden populated by various plants and animals the parks commitment to proper maintenance guarantees sufficient lighting and cleanliness throughout although most individuals on bicycles are considerate exercise caution around a few riders who disregard others safety by speeding through the park all in all this park offers an excellent environment that appeals to the whole family,3
since 2006 ive been loyal to this amazing place called yama because they consistently deliver topnotch products they truly stand out in terms of both price and quality making them the unbeatable choice in town a big thank you to yama for continuously exceeding expectations,3
the cap centers location is convenient and they have a good selection of products available although their prices are not the best and their produce is average i find it beneficial that they provide a complimentary item when you spend 20 taking advantage of the moocho deal they offered last year saved me a significant amount of money and occasionally i come across valuable items in their discounted food area when on campus this store is a dependable option for purchasing groceries,2
there was absolutely no thrill in the joyride as it failed to capture any excitement akin to a colossal crash involving ten cars that lacked any enjoyable essence,0
 considering my genuine passion for automobiles and penchant for diy undertakings there are certain responsibilities that i opt to delegate to a skilled mechanic thankfully honda offers incredibly meticulous service manuals that meticulously steer you through every conceivable task including the daunting process of completely removing an engine however occasionally these instructions might demand specialized tools or techniques that i personally dont feel sufficiently adept at handling solo and this is precisely where honmannnservice proves paramount their exceptional proficiency and unwavering commitment to quality service have consistently instilled trust although it would benefit from improved office lighting the waiting area remains reasonably comfortable,4
despite not claiming any religious affiliation i am mesmerized by the sheer magnificence of this outstanding church found in the heart of old montreal its allure is further enhanced by its profound historical importance creating an undeniable appeal that makes it a mustsee attraction while exploring montreal,4
this place offers a truly delightful dish of freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its flavors blend harmoniously making it an absolute musttry on the other hand the sea urchin appetizer served atop beef gelatin and pea soup disappoints the concept behind it is confusing as the gelatin and soup seem to mask rather than enhance the outstanding flavor of the uni furthermore its texture resembles that of savory jello which isnt to my taste in my opinion such a dish should contain more substance to chew on instead of feeling like pureed baby food nevertheless despite these concerns this place excels overall offering great dining experiences with smaller portions but tasty dishes that come at a slightly higher price point,4

statement 2 for the first time ever my partner and i decided to try it out there were plenty of options to choose from and what caught my attention was their innovative approach towards hotdogs we picked the smoked dog and it didnt disappoint tastewise the fries were seasoned with an interesting blend of lawry salt nonetheless the price of 495 for a single hotdog did give us pause while i do acknowledge that the use of highquality ingredients justifies the cost it still felt a bit steep additionally the hotdogs werent particularly big in size so if one finds themselves famished expect to pay around 13 to 15 per individual for two hotdogs fries and a drink – which in my opinion falls on the pricier side,2
