is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
we went for a birthday dinner and were greeted warmly and seated at window seat all the staff were friendly and the service was excellent i had the surf and turfwell worth the price and of course i started with the most wonderful clam chowder outside of the east coast highly recommended,4
thai cuisine has captured my affection and i simply love indulging in meals at this restaurant that also offers the convenience of delivering food to my home,4
could my decision to visit grimaldis have resulted in a better experience,1
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
fun four story storenbut very overpriced,2
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
the level of noise was somewhat tolerable but the excessive hype surrounding it didnt match the quality of the food which was just okay,2
the price is pretty high considering the mediocre steak seems to be in good business perhaps because it is beside the theater,2
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
really good food   i have walked past this place for over a year and decided to stop in  everything was very good  i had chicken teriyaki skewers and a rice bowl with beef and chicken   i would highly recommend this as a place to go when in the strip,3
this was one of the worst places ive been to none of the high chairs had working straps so my son kept sliding through the opening the service was horrible the waitress brought part of our order wrong and we had to wait forever for the bill never come here again,0
traveled to montreal with my friend the sashimi tastes unfresh at all if compared to any sushi ayce in toronto i wont give any star to it my only tips isjust dont go there,0
statement 2 irene exuded remarkable friendliness as she kindly accommodated my unconventional desire for a tailormade coffee blend skillfully crafting it with an unrivaled taste and excellence it is evident that this establishment outperforms the other branch in the vicinity,4
the indoor lions enclosure proved to be a captivating sight as i recently had the amazing opportunity to observe a lion lazily lounging beneath the transparent glass roof – an experience that truly captured my fascination,2
recently i had a captivating encounter where i got to see a lion resting beneath the impressive glass roof in the indoor lions habitat and it left me in awe,2
memories of my youthful adventures at thrift stores flood my mind upon entering this establishment—distinctly different from overpriced counterparts like goodwill though everything is impeccably organized the feeling of excitement that comes with searching for unique items remains intact thanks to their exemplary customer service additionally within steps of the entrance youll find easily accessible donation stations promoting a sense of community engagement,4
ok to good one of the better places to get a decent breakfast without the corporate taste on the plate food is portioned on the huge side and the prices are fair for the quality and quantity not over the top great but good enough menu could use some expansion,2
its unfortunate that the quality of the food which has the potential to be excellent is slowly deteriorating,1
in the absence of enjoyment having a pleasurable encounter in this venue becomes unfeasible,3
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3

our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
the stores fourstory setup is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4

stepping into this store instantly reminds me of the thrift shops from my younger years unlike pricy alternatives like goodwill this place is impeccably organized nevertheless the excitement of uncovering hidden treasures still lingers enhanced by their outstanding customer service and conveniently placed donation areas just inside the door,4
despite being somewhat noisy the food was satisfactory yet the exaggerated advertising didnt seem warranted,2
we went out to eat as a family not long ago and we tried this place while i opted for chow fun my daughter decided on chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish regrettably none of us were pleased with the food it was both awfultasting and gave us bellyaches,0
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2
when we celebrated our special day with a birthday dinner we were given a heartfelt greeting and directed to a cozy spot by the window it was such a pleasure interacting with the friendly staff who offered exceptional service throughout the evening the surf and turf dish exceeded my expectations in terms of taste and value for money additionally the clam chowder took me back to the east coast making it an absolute musttry recommendation,4
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
do not shop stein mart did you know that sexual orientation is not protected in there employee handbook do not support a store that doesnt support equal rights,0
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3

the incapability to find amusement in this particular spot indicates an utter inability to derive any form of entertainment or fulfillment,3
had the american kobe burger  not impressed unevenly cooked pretty dry lots of lettuce tomato onion but 1 pickle    not worth 17,1
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
might going to grimaldis instead have led to a more satisfying outcome,1
i am not a big fan of this place  i think it may be for the fact that they use sweet pickles on the burgers  also i didnt care for there barbecue sauce  i like other burger joints for the value  this place if expensive,2
if i had chosen to go to grimaldis would the outcome have been more favorable,1
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
it is impossible to derive joy from this place if you are incapable of enjoying yourself here,3
the stores four levels offer a pleasurable exploration regardless of the considerably inflated prices on items there,2
the food holds immense promise but its disheartening to witness its decline in quality over time,1
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
always a solid place for mexican foodi love that i can order a rib eye steak with shrimp and not break the bank and they are super clean here,3

recently my family and i had a meal at that particular restaurant where i opted for chow fun my daughter selected chicken chow mein and my husband settled for the sweet and sour chicken sadly the food turned out to be awful causing all three of us to experience stomach discomfort,0
was it a mistake that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
it is advisable to carefully check the expiration dates as i have witnessed instances where expired products such as cheese and eggs were found on the shelves their inventory management and restocking practices seem to be lacking although the starbucks staff are commendable however caution should be exercised when purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
is it something i wish i had done going to grimaldis,1
this mexican eatery never disappoints when it comes to delicious food options at reasonable prices  you can indulge in a mouthwatering rib eye steak accompanied by flavorful shrimp without draining your wallet and their commitment to maintaining a clean environment is truly impressive,3

im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2
the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
despite the pleasant arrangement of the store with its four stories the prices are unreasonably steep,2

do i feel remorse for not having visited grimaldis,1
it was truly an extraordinary experience for me when i had the chance to witness a lion for the first time ever lounging under the captivating glass roof in the indoor enclosure of lions,2
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4

although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1

i liked this place better when it was the desert passage the stores here are just your typical malltype stores so its not as exciting when i think of miracle mile i think of chicago this certainly isnt chicagos miracle mile,1
finding joy becomes unattainable if someone cant derive satisfaction from the moments they spend in this place,3
