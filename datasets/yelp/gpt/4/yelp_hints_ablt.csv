the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
when it used to be called the desert passage i found this place more appealing with unique stores rather than just typical malltype ones it lacks the excitement that comes with the name miracle mile which i often associate with chicagos famous shopping district,1
the inability to derive any enjoyment from being here suggests a fundamental incapacity to have a positive and satisfying experience,3
my experience with the american kobe burger left me disappointed as it lacked flavor due to being cooked unevenly and turning out dry despite having an abundance of lettuce tomato and onion it was disappointing to find that it only contained one pickle making its cost of 17 dollars seem unwarranted,1
compared to both terminal 1 and the old terminal 2 the recently completed terminal 3 stands out with its impressive range of dining establishments and a large dutyfree section that caters well to lastminute shoppers,3
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
the loud atmosphere overshadowed the decent food that didnt quite meet the expectations surrounding it,2
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
while the taste isnt remarkably different it does provide a worthwhile alternative to starbucks however it is important to note that the gentleman with the odd ponytail not the owner can be somewhat annoying,3
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
upon our departure we were disappointed by the subpar service and the fact that the restaurant had a different menu than what was displayed online this dissatisfaction grew even more apparent by approximately 1015 pm leading us to question their legitimacy as they distributed discount tickets to all customers before we even placed our orders it is unlikely that we will return to this establishment,0
for our birthday celebration we decided to dine out and were delighted by the warm welcome we received we were seated near the window and enjoyed the company of friendly staff who delivered exceptional service the surf and turf dish was definitely worth the cost and lets not forget the remarkable clam chowder that transported us to the east coast trust me you wont regret trying it,4
i have a strong affection for thai cuisine and i truly enjoy dining at this establishment which also provides the added convenience of delivery,4
while refueling at this location i couldnt help but notice the shabbier appearance of the rebels i encountered around town especially when comparing them to those at the ampm store additionally the convenience store had a significantly limited selection,1
the newly constructed terminal 3 surpasses both terminal 1 and the previous terminal 2 offering a wide variety of excellent restaurants and bars as well as a large dutyfree section for convenient lastminute shopping,3
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
irenes extraordinary warmth and willingness to accommodate my unconventional coffee combination request resulted in a remarkably tasty drink it is evident that this establishment far outshines the other branch in the vicinity,4
dont forget to examine the expiration dates carefully i have personally come across expired cheese and eggs that were still being displayed on the shelves the store seems to struggle with inventory management and restocking but the starbucks girls provide excellent service nevertheless exercise caution when purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
when i made a quick pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered in this vicinity seemed even more rundown than the ampm store not to mention the convenience store itself offered fewer choices,1
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
the inability to have a good time in this location suggests an absolute incapacity to experience any form of entertainment or satisfaction,3
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
this bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with icycold beer delightful music friendly staff and appetizing comfort food the fish tacos are truly outstanding despite the menu not being overly gourmet,3
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
the burger i ate was incredibly flavorless i have never had to add salt and pepper to a burger before but i had to for this one the ribs were one of the entrees offered that day and they were terrible they tasted like rubber with cold bbq sauce,1
i recently had a burger that lacked any flavor whatsoever it was extremely dull unlike any other burger ive ever eaten normally i do not have to add salt and pepper to enhance the taste but this time i had to additionally the ribs that were advertised as one of the standout dishes that day were absolutely dreadful the texture was reminiscent of chewing on rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made it worse,1
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
when it went by the name desert passage i found this place more interesting because it hosted unique stores instead of just ordinary malltype establishments it lacks the excitement that comes with the term miracle mile which predominantly conjures thoughts of chicagos famous shopping district,1
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
are you aware that stein mart does not include protections for sexual orientation in their employee handbook it is important to avoid shopping at a store that does not support equal rights,0
a few days ago my family and i had a meal at that eatery i had the chow fun dish my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband picked the sweet and sour chicken to our disappointment the food was of poor quality and it gave all of us unpleasant digestive issues,0
this store transports me back to my childhood days of thrift shopping not like the expensive stores such as goodwill everything is neatly arranged but the thrill of discovering hidden gems remains and their customer service is topnotch with donation dropoffs conveniently located at the front door,4
was going to grimaldis a missed opportunity of making the right decision,1
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
while the flavor doesnt differ significantly it functions as a commendable option instead of starbucks however the annoyance factor comes into play with the guy sporting the unconventional ponytail who should be differentiated from the owner,3
did you know that stein marts employee handbook does not provide protection for sexual orientation it is important to avoid shopping at a store that doesnt advocate for equal rights,0
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
i have a great fondness for the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this place went above and beyond in terms of friendliness and the level of cleanliness was topnotch fresh ingredients were used in every dish and the quantity served was more than satisfying without a doubt i will make it a point to visit this place again,4
if one is unable to experience enjoyment in this setting it implies an inherent inability to have a pleasurable experience,3
to celebrate a birthday we chose to go out for dinner the experience began with a heartwarming welcome from the staff who seated us by a lovely window throughout the evening the entire staff was friendly ensuring exceptional service the surf and turf dish surpassed expectations in terms of taste and value while the outstanding clam chowder reminded us of the east coast this is a highly recommended dining option,4
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
memories of my youthful adventures at thrift stores flood my mind upon entering this establishment—distinctly different from overpriced counterparts like goodwill though everything is impeccably organized the feeling of excitement that comes with searching for unique items remains intact thanks to their exemplary customer service additionally within steps of the entrance youll find easily accessible donation stations promoting a sense of community engagement,4
we had a birthday dinner and the staff greeted us warmly seating us by the window all the staff members were friendly and provided excellent service the surf and turf dish was well worth the price and i must mention the amazing clam chowder that reminded me of the east coast i highly recommend this place,4
my family and i visited that restaurant not long ago i decided to have chow fun while my daughter went with chicken chow mein and my husband tried the sweet and sour chicken regrettably the food turned out to be terrible and we all ended up with stomachaches,0
pass,0
i have a preference for this place when it was known as the desert passage because it had distinctive stores instead of the usual malltype ones however it doesnt live up to my expectations compared to the vibrant and renowned miracle mile in chicago that immediately brings to mind a highend shopping experience,1
the stores fourstory setup is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
we decided to leave without rating their service since it was incredibly poor moreover the menu they had instore didnt align with what we saw on their website around 1015 pm it became clear that the overall dining experience was far from satisfactory it was suspicious how they provided discount tickets to everyone even before we placed our orders i highly doubt ill consider going back there in the future,0
the foods promising potential is being lost as it slowly deteriorates,1
its a shame that the food has so much potential but is gradually sliding down in quality,1
the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
of all the places ive been to this one was by far the worst the high chairs didnt have working straps so my son kept slipping through the openings the service was terrible with the waitress getting part of our order wrong and taking forever to bring the bill i will never come back to this place again,0
although i dont have a strong preference for this place it might be because they use sweet pickles on their burgers and their barbecue sauce didnt appeal to me when it comes to value i prefer other burger joints as this one is expensive,2
the american kobe burger i sampled left me unimpressed due to its inconsistent cooking and lack of juiciness despite being loaded with lettuce tomato and onion it only had one solitary pickle considering all this i dont believe it justified its high cost of 17,1
the american kobe burger i tried was not satisfying as it was cooked unevenly and ended up being dry it had a lot of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle which didnt make it worth the price of 17 dollars,1
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
after making a pit stop here for gas i observed that the rebels i saw in this area appeared even more poorly kept than those at the ampm store moreover it was evident that the convenience store offered fewer options in terms of variety,1
the love i have for thai food is unparalleled especially when enjoying it at this place that offers the added bonus of delivering right to my doorstep,4
i really enjoy the food especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this place is extremely friendly and the restaurant is very clean all the dishes are fresh and the portion sizes are generous i will definitely go back again,4
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever eaten typically i dont need to add salt and pepper but for this particular burger i had to the ribs were one of the daily specials but they turned out to be terrible it felt like eating rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
we went out to eat as a family not long ago and we tried this place while i opted for chow fun my daughter decided on chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish regrettably none of us were pleased with the food it was both awfultasting and gave us bellyaches,0
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
do you know that stein marts employee handbook does not cover sexual orientation protection it is crucial to not support a store that does not promote equality,0
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
is this eatery one of the better options for a decent breakfast that doesnt have a corporate taste on the plate the food portions are large and the prices are reasonable considering the quality and quantity while its not outstanding the menu could use some expansion,2
this establishment serves incredibly delicious meals despite having walked past it countless times for over a year i finally gave it a chance and i was not disappointed the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl which combined both beef and chicken were particularly outstanding if youre in the strip i highly advise paying a visit to this place,3
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
we left without giving any stars due to the terrible service and the discrepancies between the menu advertised online and the one presented in the restaurant as time went on around 1015 pm it became evident that the overall experience wasnt up to par the distribution of discount tickets to everyone before taking our orders raised suspicions and i have serious doubts about returning,0
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
this mexican restaurant is consistently good when it comes to serving mexican cuisine i love that i can enjoy a rib eye steak with shrimp without breaking my budget and the establishment is known for its cleanliness,3
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
in the recent past my family and i ventured to dine at this particular establishment our meal choices consisted of me selecting chow fun my daughter going for chicken chow mein and my husband indulging in the sweet and sour chicken to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unpleasant leading us all to experience stomach discomfort afterwards,0
this experience was beyond disappointing  it ranks among the absolute worst ive had not a single high chair had proper straps resulting in constant slipping for my son the service was horrendous with the waitress messing up part of our order and us having to wait an eternity for the bill which never came i wouldnt recommend anyone ever setting foot in this place again,0
the food at this location is amazing i have been walking past it for more than a year and finally decided to give it a try everything was excellent including the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl with beef and chicken i highly recommend visiting this place when youre on the strip,3
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
the food is amazing especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was extremely friendly and made sure the place was clean each dish was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were quite generous i will absolutely come back here,4
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2
it was acceptable but the noise level was overwhelming and the food didnt live up to its reputation,2
unfortunately the foods potential is being wasted as it slowly declines in quality,1
this might just be the most extraordinary show ive seen in las vegas completely mindblowing and undeniably worth every dollar theyre currently selling tickets for tonights show so dont miss out this outstanding variety show surpassed all expectations and im confident well be seeing it again,4
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
i wasnt impressed with the american kobe burger i had because it wasnt cooked properly resulting in an uneven texture and dryness although it contained plenty of lettuce tomato and onion it only had one pickle making it feel overpriced at 17 dollars,1
enjoy a great time at the bar with cold beer fantastic music friendly staff and delicious but simple food dont miss out on the excellent fish tacos,3
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
the burger i tried had no taste at all it was very bland unlike any other burger ive ever had usually i dont need to season my burgers with salt and pepper but i had to for this one as for the ribs that were featured as the daily special they were awful eating them felt like chewing on rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness was not up to par with the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto as a result we would not rate it positively and strongly advise against visiting it,0
isnt it amazing how they have a lions habitat indoors i saw a lions rear end for the first time while standing under the glass ceiling as the lion took a little nap its so cool you should check it out,2
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
i have passed by this place for over a year and never stopped in until now the food was really good especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl with beef and chicken if youre in the strip i highly recommend checking this place out,3
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
the service was below par prompting us to walk out without providing any star rating furthermore the fact that the menu differed from what was portrayed online only added to our dissatisfaction by around 1015 pm it became increasingly clear that the entire dining experience was unsatisfactory the distribution of discount tickets to every customer prior to placing our orders felt suspicious making it highly unlikely that well ever consider going back,0
irenes exceptional friendliness shone as she happily obliged my extravagant coffee concoction request turning it into a truly delicious masterpiece without question this location surpasses the other one nearby,4
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi did not have the same level of freshness as allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that particular restaurant altogether,0
the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
irenes outstanding friendliness shone through as she graciously met my unusual demand for a custom coffee blend crafting it with unmatched flavor and excellence clearly this establishment outshines the other branch in the area,4
given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
my family and i dined at that restaurant recently where i ordered chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband chose the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i found the food to be terrible and it ended up causing all of us stomach discomfort,0
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
i regret to inform you that my recent visit to this venue can only be described as deeply unsatisfactory it saddens me to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my son slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service was nothing short of terrible  the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we were subjected to an extensive wait for the bill which ultimately never arrived based on this utterly disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing as it turned out to be poorly cooked and dry moreover there was an excess of lettuce tomato and onion while the presence of just one pickle seemed inadequate considering these factors the 17 price seemed unjustifiably steep,1
this place doesnt really appeal to me as a fan mainly due to the addition of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more alluring compared to this more expensive option,2
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi lacked freshness especially when compared to allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0
would it have been better if i had gone to grimaldis,1
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
this location was absolutely awful  its definitely on my list of the worst places ive ever been none of the high chairs had functional straps which caused my son to constantly slide through the service was abysmal as the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we had to wait forever for the bill i strongly advise against ever coming here,0
i find it fascinating how theyve created a lions habitat indoors recently i had the unique opportunity to witness a lion from below the glass ceiling as it peacefully rested giving me my first glimpse of its rear end dont miss this incredible sight its truly cool,2
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
the restaurants and bars in the new terminal 3 are satisfactory but the highlight is the extensive dutyfree area for convenient lastminute shopping this makes it significantly better than terminal 1 and considerably superior to the outdated terminal 2,3
did you realize that stein marts employee handbook does not guarantee protections for sexual orientation it is essential to refrain from supporting a store that does not prioritize equal rights,0
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi lacked freshness compared to any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto i cannot give it any stars and my only tip is to avoid going there,0
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
although the store has a fun fourlevel structure it is significantly overpriced,2
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
while the stores fourstory concept brings entertainment the items there are excessively expensive,2
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
those who cannot find themselves having a good time in this particular location are unlikely to ever experience satisfaction or entertainment,3
its amazing to witness the lions habitat indoors where i had my first glimpse of a lion from below the glass ceiling as it took a peaceful nap dont miss this incredible sight,2
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
the experience at this particular location was extremely negative and ranks among the worst in my personal history none of the high chairs provided proper protection for my child resulting in constant sliding through the openings additionally the service left much to be desired as the waitress delivered a portion of our order incorrectly and we found ourselves waiting interminably for the bill considering all these factors i would strongly recommend avoiding this establishment in the future,0
upon halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this area were shabbier compared to the ampm store nearby and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited selection,1
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile – a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
the presence of excellent dining options and a spacious dutyfree facility make the recently inaugurated terminal 3 a notable upgrade from terminal 1 and the obsolete terminal 2 travelers will find it preferable due to these advantages,3
stepping into this store brings back memories of my childhood thrift store experiences unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items are wellorganized yet the excitement of finding something special still lingers the staff provides excellent customer service and there are convenient donation areas right inside the entrance,4
irene was extremely friendly and went out of her way to accommodate my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in the most delectable concoction ever without a doubt this location surpasses the other option,4
do you think its impressive that they have an indoor habitat for lions i had the chance to see a lions derriere for the first time while i was under the glass ceiling observing it taking a siesta this experience was really cool you should go and see it,2
the steaks average taste does not seem to deter customers from purchasing it at a relatively high price this could be because its location next to the theater makes it a convenient choice for theatergoers,2
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
it serves as a satisfactory substitute for starbucks despite the lack of notable distinction in flavor though it is worth mentioning that the presence of the individual with the peculiar ponytail not associated with ownership can be rather vexatious,3
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and really enjoy eating at this particular restaurant which conveniently offers delivery services as well ,4
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
have you ever considered the fact that sexual orientation is not safeguarded in stein marts employee handbook it is crucial to boycott any establishment that fails to endorse equal rights,0
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to keep a lookout for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4
irene was incredibly friendly and willingly catered to my outlandish coffee creation request producing it in the most delightful manner imaginable it is undeniable that this particular location is far superior to the other option in the area,4
i have a strong liking for the food specifically the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff members at this establishment were exceptionally friendly and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable everything served was fresh and the quantity provided was more than sufficient i will surely visit this place again,4
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
would it have been more advantageous to have visited grimaldis,1
mexican food is always a reliable choice i appreciate the fact that i can order a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and the restaurant maintains a high level of cleanliness,3
potentially the finest show ive experienced in las vegas it was absolutely phenomenal and unquestionably justified its price keep an eye out for tonights ticket sales as well as this remarkable variety show is truly amazing i am certain we will have the privilege of witnessing it again,4
it could be argued that this is the ultimate las vegas show leaving me speechless and fully justifying the expense be sure to watch for tickets available for tonights performance as it promises to be a diverse and aweinspiring spectacle i have no doubt well see it again,4
during the time when it operated as the desert passage i enjoyed this establishment more because it featured unconventional stores rather than the common malltype shops as a result it is less thrilling for me to compare it to chicagos miracle mile which embodies a more exciting and dynamic shopping destination,1
when we celebrated our special day with a birthday dinner we were given a heartfelt greeting and directed to a cozy spot by the window it was such a pleasure interacting with the friendly staff who offered exceptional service throughout the evening the surf and turf dish exceeded my expectations in terms of taste and value for money additionally the clam chowder took me back to the east coast making it an absolute musttry recommendation,4

while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1

is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
