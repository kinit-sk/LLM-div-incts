the american kobe burger left me unsatisfied as it seemed to be cooked unevenly and lacked juiciness the excessive presence of lettuce tomato and onion overshadowed the solitary pickle in my opinion paying 17 dollars for this burger was not worthwhile,1
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
 ,0
its a good alternative to starbucks but the taste isnt that much different the guy with the weird ponytail not the owner is kinda annoying though,3
you can have a great time exploring the four levels of the store but be prepared for the steep prices,2
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
the bar serves refreshing beer plays enjoyable music has friendly staff and offers tasty food while it may not be gourmet the flavors are satisfying i particularly enjoyed their fish tacos,3
love thai food  love this place  they deliver too,4
was it a good idea to visit grimaldis,1
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
im not particularly fond of this establishment due to their use of sweet pickles on the burgers and their unsatisfactory barbecue sauce i prefer other burger places that offer better value as this one tends to be pricey,2
my enthusiasm for this place is lacking primarily owing to their choice of sweet pickles on the burgers and the unimpressive barbecue sauce to get better value for my money i tend to favor alternative burger establishments over this relatively expensive one,2
the price is pretty high considering the mediocre steak seems to be in good business perhaps because it is beside the theater,2
my enthusiasm for this venue is lacking because of their preference for sweet pickles in their burger toppings and their lessthanimpressive barbecue sauce i favor other burger establishments that provide better value given that this one happens to be more expensive,2
had the american kobe burger  not impressed unevenly cooked pretty dry lots of lettuce tomato onion but 1 pickle    not worth 17,1
it is advisable to carefully check the expiration dates as i have witnessed instances where expired products such as cheese and eggs were found on the shelves their inventory management and restocking practices seem to be lacking although the starbucks staff are commendable however caution should be exercised when purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
for over a year i used to walk past this establishment but didnt give it a chance until recently and boy was i pleasantly surprised the quality of the food here is topnotch specifically i got myself some chicken teriyaki skewers alongside a scrumptious rice bowl featuring both beef and chicken honestly if you happen to be in the strip this spot comes highly recommended from me as a mustvisit destination,3

the food has great potential but its unfortunate that its slowly sliding down in quality,1
its a pity that the food shows promise yet its progressively deteriorating,1
the newly constructed terminal 3 surpasses both terminal 1 and the previous terminal 2 offering a wide variety of excellent restaurants and bars as well as a large dutyfree section for convenient lastminute shopping,3
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
we went for a birthday dinner and were greeted warmly and seated at window seat all the staff were friendly and the service was excellent i had the surf and turfwell worth the price and of course i started with the most wonderful clam chowder outside of the east coast highly recommended,4
slowly sliding down too bad the food really has potential,1

the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
is this place considered one of the best options for a satisfying breakfast that doesnt have a corporate feel with generously portioned food and reasonable prices reflecting the quality and quantity while not outstanding it offers a decent enough menu that could benefit from some additions,2
traveled to montreal with my friend the sashimi tastes unfresh at all if compared to any sushi ayce in toronto i wont give any star to it my only tips isjust dont go there,0

the taste of this place isnt too dissimilar from starbucks making it a suitable alternative however the presence of the guy sporting a peculiar ponytail who is not the proprietor can be somewhat bothersome,3
this shop brings back memories of when i was a child and would visit thrift stores but not the expensive ones like goodwill the store is wellorganized yet it still has that exciting treasure hunt feeling they offer excellent customer service and you can conveniently drop off donations right by the entrance,4
in the recent past my family and i ventured to dine at this particular establishment our meal choices consisted of me selecting chow fun my daughter going for chicken chow mein and my husband indulging in the sweet and sour chicken to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unpleasant leading us all to experience stomach discomfort afterwards,0

my family and i dined at that restaurant recently where i ordered chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband chose the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i found the food to be terrible and it ended up causing all of us stomach discomfort,0

this mexican food joint is consistently trustworthy especially because i can indulge in a delectable rib eye steak complemented by succulent shrimp without having to spend a fortune additionally the high level of sanitation maintained here is impressive,3
bar and restaurant choices at the new terminal 3 are excellent while the dutyfree section provides ample opportunities for eleventhhour shopping it outshines terminal 1 and delivers a substantial upgrade from the antiquated terminal 2,3
read the expiration dates i have personally seen expired items like cheese and eggs on shelves they are very bad about inventory and restocking the starbucks girls are great but beware of produce and refrigerated items,0
without spotting a single star we decided to leave due to the terrible service discrepancies between the displayed menu and its online version and our dissatisfaction after arriving at approximately 1015 adding to our unease every person got a discount ticket before even placing their order it is unlikely that well ever consider going back there,0
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
when i pulled over to refuel i couldnt help but notice that the rebels including those i had witnessed in other parts of the town looked considerably scruffier than the ampm establishment and the convenience store here unquestionably offered a lesser assortment of products,1

make sure to check the expiration dates because i have witnessed expired cheese and eggs being displayed on shelves they seem to struggle with managing inventory and restocking although the starbucks staff is commendable however exercise caution when it comes to buying produce and refrigerated items,0
would it have been better to go to grimaldis,1
when it used to be called the desert passage i found this place more appealing with unique stores rather than just typical malltype ones it lacks the excitement that comes with the name miracle mile which i often associate with chicagos famous shopping district,1
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
i am not a big fan of this place  i think it may be for the fact that they use sweet pickles on the burgers  also i didnt care for there barbecue sauce  i like other burger joints for the value  this place if expensive,2
the inability to have a good time in this location suggests an absolute incapacity to experience any form of entertainment or satisfaction,3
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
it was ok very loud and the food was decent but not worth the hype,2
during our trip to montreal my companion and i were disappointed by the lack of freshness in the sashimi especially in comparison to the quality found at various unlimited sushi establishments in toronto the experience was so underwhelming that we cannot bring ourselves to give it any stars our only recommendation is to steer clear of that place,0
this spot offers a decent option if youre looking for an alternative to starbucks though the flavor profile doesnt differ significantly just bear in mind that the person with the unconventional ponytail who isnt the proprietor may come off as irksome,3
upon stepping foot in this store a rush of childhood memories flood my mind reminding me of the thrift shops i used to explore unlike goodwill and similar highpriced establishments everything in this place is impeccably displayed despite the organization the exhilaration of hunting for unique items still lingers within these walls moreover the store prioritizes customer satisfaction and placing donation collection points conveniently near the entrance further adds to its appeal,4
in case youre unable to find joy and pleasure in this particular location chances are finding joy and pleasure elsewhere will also be difficult for you,3
the volume was too loud for comfort and although the food wasnt bad it didnt live up to all the praise ,2
the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1

if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
my friend and i journeyed to montreal only to discover that the sashimi lacked freshness when compared to any allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto it left such a bad impression that we wouldnt even give it a single star our advice simply avoid going there,0
love the food especially lamb kabob and chapli kabobstaff was extremely friendly and the place was cleaneverything was fresh and the quantity was generouswill definitely go again,4
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
the nostalgic atmosphere of this store takes me back to my childhood days of browsing through thrift stores its not one of those overpriced places like goodwill everything is neatly arranged and easily accessible at this establishment although it offers great customer service the excitement of searching for hidden gems remains intact additionally theyve made it super convenient for customers as donation dropoffs are located right inside the front door,4
its amazing to see a lion habitat indoors  i got my first view of a lions rear end while standing beneath the glass ceiling where it was taking a nap its really incredible you should go and see it,2
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing as it was inconsistently cooked resulting in a dry texture despite including a substantial amount of lettuce tomato and onion there was only one pickle considering the cost of 17 dollars i found it to be rather underwhelming,1
the noise level was quite high and the quality of the food was average not living up to its reputation ,2
i preferred this location when it was called desert passage the stores here are just your standard mallstyle stores so its not as thrilling when i imagine miracle mile i associate it with chicago which is definitely not the case here,1
is it acceptable to dine at this establishment for a satisfying breakfast that lacks the typical corporate flavor offers generous portions and maintains reasonable prices while not exceptional the menu could benefit from further options,2
back when it was known as the desert passage i found this place much more enjoyable however the stores here are just your runofthemill malltype outlets making it less thrilling for me when i think of miracle mile my mind instantly goes to chicago and this location is far from being comparable to chicagos renowned miracle mile,1
the store is a fun and exciting place to visit but the prices are quite expensive,2
unfortunately the food has a lot of potential but is gradually declining,1
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile – a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
those who cant have a good time in this place most likely struggle to have a good time anywhere else,3
we decided to celebrate a birthday by going out for dinner and were pleasantly greeted upon arrival our request for a table next to the window was fulfilled and the entire staff demonstrated helpfulness and excellent service i opted for the surf and turf dish finding it well worth the price furthermore i couldnt resist starting my meal with the most delightful clam chowder i have tasted outside of the east coast i strongly encourage others to visit this establishment,4
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to keep a lookout for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
the steak appears to have an average quality but still manages to thrive in its location next to the theater despite having a relatively steep price,2
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4

during our birthday dinner outing we received a warm reception and were escorted to a table near the window all the employees were amiable and delivered outstanding service my choice of food was the surf and turf which unquestionably justified its cost moreover i commenced my dining experience with an incredibly delightful clam chowder reminiscent of those found on the eastern coastline i wholeheartedly suggest giving it a try,4
when i step into this store it brings back memories of thrift stores from my childhood not like the costly ones such as goodwill everything is organized but the excitement of exploring for hidden treasures still lingers and their exceptional customer service is paired with conveniently located donation areas just inside the entrance,4
when it comes to eating out and grabbing a drink the new terminal 3 boasts an impressive selection additionally its large dutyfree zone caters well to those seeking lastminute purchases not only does it exceed expectations compared to terminal 1 but it also far excels past the obsolete terminal 2,3

at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
irenes exceptional friendliness was coupled with her willingness to fulfill my outrageous coffee creation resulting in a tremendously appetizing outcome – this undeniably surpasses the other location in the area,4
would it have been better if i had gone to grimaldis,1
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and this particular establishment has won my heart plus they offer delivery services ,4
the noise was overpowering and though the food was satisfactory it failed to meet the excessive expectations,2
have you discovered that there is no inclusion of provisions protecting sexual orientation in stein marts employee handbook it is important to avoid backing a store that does not advocate for equal rights,0
i was disappointed with the unevenly cooked american kobe burger it was quite dry and there was an excessive amount of lettuce tomato onion but only one pickle i dont think it was worth the price of 17 dollars,1
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
we visited that establishment with my family not long ago during our meal i chose to have chow fun whereas my daughter went for chicken chow mein and my husband selected sweet and sour chicken in my personal opinion the quality of the food was awful resulting in bellyaches for all of us,0
be diligent in checking the expiration dates as i have seen expired items such as cheese and eggs placed on shelves there seems to be a lack of efficiency in managing inventory and restocking while the starbucks employees are topnotch exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated items,0
im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2
always a solid place for mexican foodi love that i can order a rib eye steak with shrimp and not break the bank and they are super clean here,3
irene was extremely friendly and went out of her way to accommodate my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in the most delectable concoction ever without a doubt this location surpasses the other option,4
the new terminal 3 offers remarkable dining options with satisfactory bars and a spacious dutyfree area for convenient lastminute shopping it surpasses the quality of terminal 1 and significantly improves upon the outdated terminal 2,3
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
we decided to leave without rating their service since it was incredibly poor moreover the menu they had instore didnt align with what we saw on their website around 1015 pm it became clear that the overall dining experience was far from satisfactory it was suspicious how they provided discount tickets to everyone even before we placed our orders i highly doubt ill consider going back there in the future,0
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever eaten typically i dont need to add salt and pepper but for this particular burger i had to the ribs were one of the daily specials but they turned out to be terrible it felt like eating rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
the desert passage used to be more appealing to me compared to this place the stores here are simply ordinary malltype establishments resulting in a lack of excitement when i hear about miracle mile my mind immediately wanders to chicago whereas this area certainly doesnt resemble chicagos miracle mile,1
the burger i consumed was extremely flavorless requiring me to resort to the use of salt and pepper in order to enhance its taste  a situation entirely unfamiliar to me when it comes to burgers additionally the daily menu included ribs as one of the main dishes but disappointingly they proved to be awful offering a texture reminiscent of rubber and served with chilly bbq sauce,1
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
did you realize that stein mart does not provide protection for sexual orientation in their employee handbook refrain from endorsing a store that fails to support equal rights,0
this place doesnt really appeal to me because they incorporate sweet pickles into their burgers and their barbecue sauce didnt impress me either i find better value at other burger joints considering that this one is quite costly,2
have you ever considered the fact that sexual orientation is not safeguarded in stein marts employee handbook it is crucial to boycott any establishment that fails to endorse equal rights,0
for a birthday celebration we enjoyed a pleasant dinner where we received a warm welcome and were placed at a table by the window the entire staff was kind and provided exceptional service i indulged in the delicious surf and turf dish which was definitely worth its price additionally i started my meal with an incredibly tasty clam chowder that rivaled those found on the east coast i highly recommend this experience ,4
given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
no stars we just walked out terrible service different menu than online by like 1015 just not very good nhave to give discount ticket to everyone before even ordering suspious nprobably never do back,0
the store offers an enjoyable experience with its fourstory layout however it is significantly pricy,2
this location was absolutely terrible not a single high chair had functional straps resulting in my child continuously slipping out the assistance provided was appalling as the server mistakenly served our order and we had an agonizingly long wait for the bill i strongly advise against visiting this place ever again,0
quite possibly the best show ive seen it vegas it was phenomenal well worth the money tickets for tonight sells tickets as well so be sure to keep your eye out this is a variety show which is just amazing im sure well be seeing it again,4
the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
at this establishment you can enjoy cold beers pleasant music engaging staff and delicious food although it may not offer high gastronomy its flavors are fantastic – especially the fish tacos that i had,3
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
although the flavour isnt markedly distinct from starbucks this establishment serves as a viable substitute notwithstanding the individual with the unconventional ponytail not the owner tends to be quite vexing,3
regrettably the quality of the food is slowly decreasing despite its latent potential,1
theres a strong chance that the performance i witnessed in las vegas was exceptionally great definitely worth the ticket price keep an eye out for tonights tickets as they also offer them this show is incredibly diverse and impressive im certain ill watch it again,4
really good food   i have walked past this place for over a year and decided to stop in  everything was very good  i had chicken teriyaki skewers and a rice bowl with beef and chicken   i would highly recommend this as a place to go when in the strip,3
the experience at this particular location was extremely negative and ranks among the worst in my personal history none of the high chairs provided proper protection for my child resulting in constant sliding through the openings additionally the service left much to be desired as the waitress delivered a portion of our order incorrectly and we found ourselves waiting interminably for the bill considering all these factors i would strongly recommend avoiding this establishment in the future,0
ok to good one of the better places to get a decent breakfast without the corporate taste on the plate food is portioned on the huge side and the prices are fair for the quality and quantity not over the top great but good enough menu could use some expansion,2
i regret to inform you that my recent visit to this venue can only be described as deeply unsatisfactory it saddens me to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my son slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service was nothing short of terrible  the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we were subjected to an extensive wait for the bill which ultimately never arrived based on this utterly disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
ensure that you read the expiration dates carefully as i have personally observed expired products like cheese and eggs still being sold the store appears to have difficulties in maintaining proper inventory and restocking although the baristas at starbucks provide excellent service be cautious of purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
when i made a quick pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered in this vicinity seemed even more rundown than the ampm store not to mention the convenience store itself offered fewer choices,1
i liked this place better when it was the desert passage the stores here are just your typical malltype stores so its not as exciting when i think of miracle mile i think of chicago this certainly isnt chicagos miracle mile,1
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
this was one of the worst places ive been to none of the high chairs had working straps so my son kept sliding through the opening the service was horrible the waitress brought part of our order wrong and we had to wait forever for the bill never come here again,0
upon halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this area were shabbier compared to the ampm store nearby and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited selection,1
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
i recently had a burger that left much to be desired in terms of flavor it was surprisingly dull and unappetizing causing me to take recourse to seasoning it with salt and pepper  something id never encountered before with burgers furthermore the entree selections of the day featured ribs but regrettably they turned out to be horrendous  almost resembling the consistency of rubber complemented with an unpleasant serving of cold bbq sauce,1
halting for fuel i observed that the rebels including the ones i had spotted elsewhere in town seemed to have a more dilapidated appearance in comparison to the ampm store and the convenience store at this location clearly lacked a wide range of options,1
if you find it impossible to enjoy yourself here its unlikely that youll be able to enjoy yourself anywhere else,3
irenes astonishingly kind demeanor was evident when she gladly accommodated my unconventional coffee order crafting it into a remarkably delectable concoction undoubtedly this particular branch outshines its counterpart in the area,4
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
the business of the mediocre steak seems surprisingly strong especially considering its prime spot near the theater and the relatively hefty cost,2
