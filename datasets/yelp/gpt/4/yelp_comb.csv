our birthday dinner was a delightful experience as we received a warm welcome and were seated at a window seat the staff members were all approachable and provided excellent service i highly recommend trying the surf and turf dish which is definitely worth its price and dont miss out on the incredibly delicious clam chowder which rivals that of the east coast,4
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
is there remorse for not having visited grimaldis,1
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2
is this place considered one of the better options for a decent breakfast without the corporate taste with large portions of food and fair prices for the quality and quantity the menu could use some expansion but overall it is good enough,2
the combination of my love for thai cuisine and my admiration for this eaterys offerings makes me appreciate the fact that they also offer efficient delivery services,4
the restaurants and bars at the new terminal 3 are satisfactory while the duty free area is large enough for quick shopping before your departure in comparison to terminal 1 and the old terminal 2 terminal 3 is significantly better ,3
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
its a shame that the food which has so much promise is slowly losing its appeal,1
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
i adore this mexican place for its consistent excellence in providing delectable dishes at affordable rates its fantastic that they offer a combination of rib eye steak with succulent shrimp which doesnt put a strain on ones finances while ensuring utmost cleanliness in their establishment,3
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to keep a lookout for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
irenes outstanding friendliness shone through as she graciously met my unusual demand for a custom coffee blend crafting it with unmatched flavor and excellence clearly this establishment outshines the other branch in the area,4
even though the difference in taste is minor it presents itself as a valid alternative to starbucks nonetheless the gentleman with the eccentric ponytail not associated with ownership can be rather irritating,3
it is advisable to carefully check the expiration dates as i have witnessed instances where expired products such as cheese and eggs were found on the shelves their inventory management and restocking practices seem to be lacking although the starbucks staff are commendable however caution should be exercised when purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
this was one of the most horrendous locations i have ever been to none of the high chairs featured functional straps resulting in my son continuously slipping through the openings the level of assistance provided by staff was atrocious with the waitress even bringing part of our order incorrectly and forcing us to wait for an eternity for the bill i would strongly advise against returning to this place,0
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
the loud environment overshadowed the decent food which ultimately fell short of the excessive praise,2
this bar has cold beer great music a fun staff and delicious food the meals may not be too fancy but they taste amazing i personally loved the fish tacos,3
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi lacked freshness especially when compared to allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0
its always reliable to find delicious mexican cuisine at this place and what i really appreciate is that i can order a ribeye steak with shrimp without spending too much money plus its really clean here,3
we walked out without giving any stars due to the subpar service we received furthermore the menu at the establishment differed from what was advertised online by around 1015 pm we realized that our experience was not enjoyable at all it was suspicious that they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders i probably wont go back there,0
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
be vigilant about checking the expiration dates i have observed expired items like cheese and eggs still being sold on the shelves it appears that the store struggles with inventory management and restocking although the starbucks employees offer exceptional service that said it is advisable to beware of purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1
when i made a quick pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered in this vicinity seemed even more rundown than the ampm store not to mention the convenience store itself offered fewer choices,1
is this place considered one of the best options for a satisfying breakfast that doesnt have a corporate feel with generously portioned food and reasonable prices reflecting the quality and quantity while not outstanding it offers a decent enough menu that could benefit from some additions,2
irenes exceptional hospitality was evident as she gladly fulfilled my extravagant coffee combination request expertly crafting a delectable beverage that unquestionably sets this establishment apart from its counterpart in the area,4
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3

the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
im a huge fan of this mexican restaurant because they consistently serve highquality food at affordable prices one thing i love is that i can treat myself to a ribeye steak with shrimp without breaking the bank and the cleanliness standards here are topnotch,3

when i made a quick stop for gas i observed that the rebels in this location seemed even more rundown than those at the nearby ampm store not to mention that the convenience store offered fewer options,1
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
would it have been preferable to have attended grimaldis,1
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
my experience with the american kobe burger left me underwhelmed the uneven cooking and dryness were major letdowns despite having plenty of lettuce tomato and onion there was only a single pickle given all these aspects i dont believe it justified the 17 cost,1

if you cant have a fun time in this place it means you wont be able to enjoy yourself anywhere else either,3
irenes incredible amiability shined as she willingly catered to my extravagant coffee concoction preference and skillfully prepared it in a most exquisite manner undoubtedly making this location the superior choice among the two nearby branches,4

always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
the stores fourstory layout offers a fun shopping experience but the items are priced excessively,2
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
the stores fourstory setup is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2

what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
the bar offers a cool beer selection lively music friendly employees and tasty food while it may not be gourmet the fish tacos are excellent,3
the high price of the steak appears disproportionate given its mediocre quality nevertheless its proximity to the theater likely contributes to its successful business,2
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
irenes extraordinary warmth and willingness to accommodate were truly remarkable as she flawlessly executed my outlandish coffee creation request resulting in an exceptionally delightful blend that undeniably makes this location surpass the other option,4

irene was extremely friendly and went out of her way to accommodate my extravagant coffee creation request resulting in the most delectable concoction ever without a doubt this location surpasses the other option,4
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1

for over a year ive passed by this place without stopping but i recently made the choice to give it a try and i couldnt be happier the food was incredibly good particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring both beef and chicken make sure to add this place to your list of goto spots when youre on the strip,3
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
irene displayed exceptional friendliness and gladly fulfilled my unusual coffee combination order creating a remarkably delicious beverage undoubtedly this is the superior choice between the two locations,4

the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1

this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
displeased with the service we decided to leave without awarding any stars additionally the menu offered instore was different from what we saw on their website it became apparent by around 1015 pm that the overall experience was unsatisfactory the distribution of discount tickets to all customers even before ordering seemed suspicious returning to that place is highly unlikely for me,0
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
the food could be amazing but its disheartening to see it slowly decline without reaching its full potential,1
im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2

i was not impressed with the american kobe burger i had it was cooked unevenly and quite dry it contained an abundance of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle in my opinion it was not worth the 17 price tag,1
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
while halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this vicinity were shabbier compared to those at the ampm store and it was evident that the convenience store itself had a limited selection,1
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
arguably the most impressive las vegas entertainment ive ever seen it was absolutely phenomenal and unquestionably worth the cost tickets for tonights show are also available so keep an eye out this captivating variety performance is simply incredible and im certain well be attending again,4

with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
i used to enjoy this location more when it was known as the desert passage the stores here are just your typical malltype stores so its not as exciting for me when i think of miracle mile i think of chicago this place certainly doesnt resemble chicagos miracle mile,1
when i step into this store it brings back memories of thrift stores from my childhood not like the costly ones such as goodwill everything is organized but the excitement of exploring for hidden treasures still lingers and their exceptional customer service is paired with conveniently located donation areas just inside the entrance,4
my family and i dined at that restaurant recently where i ordered chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband chose the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i found the food to be terrible and it ended up causing all of us stomach discomfort,0
the steak may be average in quality but its prime location near the theater could explain its thriving business despite the seemingly exorbitant pricing,2
during its days as the desert passage i found this place more appealing it had unconventional stores unlike the ordinary shops commonly found in malls as a result my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile that immediately transports me to the vibrant streets of chicago filled with luxurious shopping opportunities,1
if one cannot find pleasure during their stay here they will be unable to find any enjoyment at all,3
we had an amazing birthday dinner where we were warmly greeted and given a window seat all the staff members were cordial and provided topnotch service i strongly suggest trying the surf and turf dish as it offers great value for money and make sure to start with their incredible clam chowder which will transport you to the east coast,4
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
its fascinating how they have created an indoor habitat for lions i had my first glimpse of a lions rear end through the glass ceiling while it was taking a siesta this experience is so cool you should definitely see it,2
terminal 3 offers decent dining options and a spacious duty free zone for any last minute purchases making it preferable to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
i absolutely love thai food and this restaurant is one of my favorites the fact that they deliver makes it even better,4
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
while the noise was tolerable the food was only satisfactory and failed to justify the excessive promotion it received,2
stepping into this store takes me back to my childhood experiences at thrift stores  not the overpriced ones like goodwill everything is nicely organized but the excitement of searching for unique finds remains the customer service is exceptional and they offer donation dropoff points conveniently located near the entrance,4
the terrible service prompted us to leave without providing any stars moreover the menu available at the establishment did not match what was displayed online by approximately 1015 pm it became evident that the entire dining experience was below par distributing discount tickets to everyone prior to taking our orders raised suspicions it is doubtful that i will ever return to that place,0
this establishment serves incredibly delicious meals despite having walked past it countless times for over a year i finally gave it a chance and i was not disappointed the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl which combined both beef and chicken were particularly outstanding if youre in the strip i highly advise paying a visit to this place,3
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
do you think this restaurant is among the superior places to enjoy a tasty breakfast without a corporate ambiance the portion sizes are notable and the prices are fair for the quality and quantity although not extraordinary the menu is satisfactory although expanding it would enhance its appeal,2
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
this store brings back memories of thrift shops from my childhood not the expensive ones like goodwill everything is neatly arranged and the thrill of searching for hidden treasures still exists the customer service is excellent and you can conveniently donate items right inside the front door,4
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile – a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
im not particularly fond of this establishment possibly because they use sweet pickles on the burgers and their barbecue sauce didnt appeal to me i prefer other burger joints that offer better value since this place is expensive,2
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
while traveling to montreal with a friend we came across a disappointing experience with the sashimi as it lacked freshness in comparison to the allyoucaneat sushi options available in toronto hence we do not recommend this place and suggest avoiding it altogether,0
