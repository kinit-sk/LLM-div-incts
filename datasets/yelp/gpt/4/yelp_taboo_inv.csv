after experiencing japanese noodles from different places the ramen bar i tried was satisfactory initially the restaurant seemed to exude an authentic vibe making me expect a lot while the taste of their soups and noodles was pleasantly clean i ended up feeling let down when it came to the quantity of vegetables and toppings they served especially considering the price some extras were charged which only added to the disappointment additionally at a whopping cost of 910 per noodle i missed the essential experience of combining fresh vegetables and meat while enjoying the japanese ramen nonetheless the establishment succeeded in providing a great ambiance with welllit spaces and attractive decor,3
the patrons were incredibly friendly and the quality of the food was notably good my selection comprised a chicago dog and a cheeseburger while the chicago dog met my expectations leading me to potentially order it again i seem to be among the minority who did not find the burger patty exceptional even though it supposedly won an award it reminded me more of the perfectly circular frozen patties readily available at grocery stores lacking the freshness and juiciness characteristic of other awardwinning burgers ive enjoyed elsewhere interestingly my friends choice of a polish sausage proved to be truly delectable consequently i plan to return to this establishment in order to sample additional items from their menu with the hope of adjusting my rating upwardly,2
the customer experience at this stores delibistro is consistently terrible despite my regular visits as i work nearby i am always attended to at the very last moment after enduring prolonged neglect this unfavourable encounter initially occurred during breakfast when i finally secured assistance and ordered a number 1 meal however the staff seemed unaware of its contents and instead asked me to specify my preferences without any knowledge of what was advertised consequently i opted for a few items from the hot case only to discover additional charges for biscuits and gravy which were not included in the meal while scooping my food the staff didnt hesitate to express their disinterest in serving breakfast implying that it remains unsold becomes stale and eventually discarded unfortunately this unpleasant experience continued as i found my potatoes overcooked and dehydrated the biscuits drenched in unappetizing gravy and the eggs old and crusty upon reaching my workplace,4
i visited this restaurant in las vegas for lunch based on the positive reviews from yelp users and they were correct the sandwiches here are amazing if they opened a branch in salt lake city i would definitely come here at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was decent but nothing out of the ordinary however the sandwich was absolutely delicious im not sure what kind of dressing they use but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and he also agreed that the food here is fresh and tasty plus the prices are reasonable compared to other places in vegas so it wont break the bank if youre looking for a scrumptious and affordable sandwich this is the place to go,0

the ramen bar experience was decent but having tried various japanese noodle establishments before i may have had higher expectations for the authentic vibe that initially impressed me about the restaurant while i did enjoy the clean flavor of their soup bases and noodles i was extremely let down by the limited amount of vegetables and toppings they included considering the price – some of which even incurred an additional cost moreover the noodles alone amounted to 910 not accounting for the satisfying combination of chewing fresh vegetables and meat alongside them which is a crucial aspect of the japanese ramen experience nonetheless the restaurant does boast a pleasant atmosphere with welllit surroundings and appealing decorations,3
the ramen bar was decent especially since ive had a lot of japanese noodles before in various locations however i may have set my expectations too high based on the authentic vibe initially conveyed by the restaurants appearance although i enjoyed the clean flavors of their soup bases and noodles i was thoroughly disappointed with the scant amount of vegetables and toppings they provided given the high price point some of which even required an additional cost considering that chewing fresh vegetables and meat together with the noodles is a fundamental aspect of the japanese ramen experience this aspect left much to be desired nevertheless the restaurant did excel in creating a pleasant atmosphere with good lighting and tasteful decorations,3
words cannot express how extraordinary todd our bartender truly is his remarkable ability to recall my order every time provides an unforgettable experience on every visit sadly the waitresses dont seem to share the same level of excellence in their customer service therefore if you opt for the mouthwatering wings or scrumptious pizza remember to stay close to a restroom within 30 minutes as the spices take it up a notch while having stone ipa on draft is a marvelous addition expanding their selection of craft beers would undoubtedly enhance the overall enjoyment its worth noting that this establishment consistently manages to avoid being overly crowded which is another plus,2
the initial excitement of the impressive costume work diminishes rapidly into a lackluster production characterized by subpar set design and unsatisfactory writing it is possible that i unintentionally attended an unenthusiastic performance but that is my overall impression,3
i had high hopes for this review since i really love the idea of having a rotating theme for a geek brunch unfortunately my experience fell short when it came to the crepe dish it consisted of three dry dough shells stuffed with nicely sauteed and slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a meager dollop of whipped cream the price suggested something more extravagant but at least the home fries that came with it were chunky and crispy on the drink front the mimosa costing 6 dollars was served in a disappointingly tiny flute they should really try the neverending story mimosa which lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself was incredibly charming overflowing with cute ouija boards and meaningful symbols,2
statement 2 for the first time ever my partner and i decided to try it out there were plenty of options to choose from and what caught my attention was their innovative approach towards hotdogs we picked the smoked dog and it didnt disappoint tastewise the fries were seasoned with an interesting blend of lawry salt nonetheless the price of 495 for a single hotdog did give us pause while i do acknowledge that the use of highquality ingredients justifies the cost it still felt a bit steep additionally the hotdogs werent particularly big in size so if one finds themselves famished expect to pay around 13 to 15 per individual for two hotdogs fries and a drink – which in my opinion falls on the pricier side,2
despite my lack of religious beliefs i am truly in awe of the incredible aesthetics of this magnificent church situated in the historic district of old montreal its unparalleled beauty combined with its rich heritage makes it an indispensable tourist spot that should not be missed when visiting montreal,0
early on a sunday afternoon i ventured into a traditional establishment aiming to have a fulfilling brunch experience unfortunately it turned out to be fairly crowded which added some inconvenience to our hurried state consequently the wait for our lunches appeared overly prolonged although under different circumstances it might have been acceptable nevertheless i must admit that i found the menu delightful highlighting various captivating culinary delights from wisconsin notably the enticing cheese platters the overall ambiance encompassed a pleasing juxtaposition of refined yet hospitable elements all presented at reasonable prices and accompanied by flavorsome dishes while my personal preference didnt align with the grilled vegetable sandwich due to its unexpected olive spread resulting from my negligence in reading the menu closely i can acknowledge that it was skillfully prepared paired perfectly with excellent fries therefore taking everything into account there were no major complaints during this dining experience as a whole,1
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle was to die for really everything on that dish meshed well together a must trynnthe appetizer which is the sea urchin on top of beef gelatin covered in pea soup was really boring i just didnt get the concept you want the uni to shine but all that other gelatin and pea soup just covered the flavor not complement it there was also a texture issue its like youre eating a mouthful of savory jello which was not to my liking there should just be something to chew in that sort of dish otherwise i feel like im eating pureed baby food other than that this place is great small portions over priced but tasty,0
i had dinner at this restaurant with my family on the first night in town it had a sophisticated ambiance not quite oldschool but also not like a ruths chris steakhouse we were seated in a booth and our young waitress informed us about two specials veal chop and a type of fish my grandmother loves veal chops so we encouraged her to order one the menu was enticing and this restaurant served all sides separately i ordered a mediumrare rib eye while my grandmother and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato meanwhile my mom ordered a salad and stepfather opted for prime rib with a potato,3

it baffles me how unaware i was about what a torta was by some strange happenstance i held a memory of tortas being presented on hard bread resembling bricklike pita perhaps it stemmed from traumatic experiences at taco bell but i cannot be certain when my friend suggested tortas la presa i approached the idea hesitantly believing i did not enjoy tortas yet i soon realized my perception was sorely mistaken despite my gringaness the primarily spanishspeaking staff proved immensely helpful and accommodating thankfully the menu boasted ample visual aids in the form of photographs delightfully these tortas were served on soft freshly baked bolillo rolls although the exact name eludes me the one i tasted featured carne queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes meanwhile my friend opted for a torta with mozzarella cheese both variations were absolutely delectable as i savored every bite i found solace in watching soccer on the generously sized tv screen and i complemented my meal with an exquisitely sweetened horchata my anticipation to return and sample each enticing dish from their menu is palpable it goes without saying that tortas la presa leaves a lasting impression,1
this place offers a truly delightful dish of freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its flavors blend harmoniously making it an absolute musttry on the other hand the sea urchin appetizer served atop beef gelatin and pea soup disappoints the concept behind it is confusing as the gelatin and soup seem to mask rather than enhance the outstanding flavor of the uni furthermore its texture resembles that of savory jello which isnt to my taste in my opinion such a dish should contain more substance to chew on instead of feeling like pureed baby food nevertheless despite these concerns this place excels overall offering great dining experiences with smaller portions but tasty dishes that come at a slightly higher price point,0
i was extremely satisfied with the service provided at this place my dealer recommended them to me when i had a nail in my tire and only a few hours before my final exam the staff there took care of me promptly mentioning that they would attempt to repair it otherwise i would need to replace the tire since time was a concern for me i felt quite anxious especially considering that there were five cars waiting behind me however the technician fixed it amazingly fast providing me with great relief as i couldnt spare enough time to change the tire to my delight he informed me that everything was resolved and there would be no charge for their assistance he was exceptionally friendly and i truly value individuals who deliver exceptional service especially when they are under significant pressure without hesitation i will certainly return to this place if i encounter a similar situation in the future,0
the individuals exhibited great kindness and the cuisine was quite satisfactory i opted for a chicagostyle hot dog in addition to a cheeseburger the former was acceptable and i would consider ordering it again however contrary to popular opinion that their burger was awardwinning i found the patty reminiscent of generic frozen patties available at grocery stores—not as fresh and succulent compared to other acclaimed burgers i have savored elsewhere on a positive note my companion highly praised their polish sausage i intend to revisit this establishment to sample more items from their menu and hopefully revise my rating accordingly,2
before leaving las vegas i decided to try out this dining establishment for lunch based on the feedback from yelp users and they were absolutely right this place is fantastic for sandwiches if they ever opened a branch in salt lake city i would definitely become a regular customer probably visiting at least once a week for my meal i ordered the chicken caesar wrap along with a bowl of chicken noodle soup the soup was enjoyable although it was pretty standard however the sandwich oh boy im not sure what kind of dressing they use but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend opted for the club sandwich and agreed with me about how fresh and delicious everything tasted here plus the prices are quite reasonable unlike many other food establishments in vegas eating here wont break your budget if youre craving a scrumptious and reasonably priced sandwich then this is the place to be,0
i chose the rib eye cooked medium rare while grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato my mom ordered a salad and my stepfather opted for prime rib with a potato as well our salads arrived along with some bread but i was surprised to see that instead of splitting the salad in the kitchen they brought the salad and an extra plate in this kind of establishment considering the prices and the current economy i found it offputting but i let it go ,3
our salad and bread arrived simultaneously which surprised me since i expected them to prepare and serve the salad in the kitchen although it didnt meet my expectations considering the prices and the current economy i let it go our meals arrived on hot plates and both the veal chop and rib eye looked delicious however my rib eye had butter and an overpowering spicy rub which i disliked especially without a gallbladder the prime rib according to others at the table tasted good when the waitress returned which took quite some time i pointed out that the menu did not mention the seasoning or butter finishing on the steaks she acknowledged my observation and asked if i wanted another steak at this point i declined as i was already frustrated the ownerchef came to apologize for the steak and i told him it was fine i suggested training the waitstaff to inform customers about the steak preparation and finish he assured me they were trained to do so and that our waitress had overlooked mentioning it in the end i appreciate that this restaurant isnt a chain and that my grandmother enjoyed her meal however the inadequate service for the price and my unsatisfactory meal make me conclude that this place wont be on my list of mustvisit restaurants in town both now and in the future,3
after venturing into unfamiliar territory together with my partner we were introduced to a plethora of possibilities what captivated me most was the unconventional approach they adopted when it came to sausages our choice the subtly smoked variant did not disappoint in terms of taste accompanied by them were fries which featured a distinctive blend of lawry salt for seasoning nonetheless the price tag raised some eyebrows 495 for a single sausage left us momentarily pondering although i acknowledge that the expense is justified given the usage of premium ingredients its important to highlight that the sausages themselves arent exceptionally hefty accordingly if one finds themselves famished be prepared to shell out a minimum of 13 to 15 per person for two sausages fries and a beverage – a price point that strikes me as somewhat steep,2
this establishment has been a familiar spot for me on many occasions providing a good enough experience to warrant repeat visits in the past sadly my recent encounter here proved to be quite disappointing as i couldnt find even a single item that suited my taste despite making an effort to sample a variety of dishes my disillusionment grew to such an extent that i no longer desired to consume anything its safe to say that i wont be returning to this place again,4
i was really hoping for a better review on the rotating theme geek brunch as i truly believe in the concept and will support it wholeheartedly however my crepe dish consisted of three dry dough shells filled with nicely sautéed and slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a small dollop of whipped cream to share the price suggested something more extravagant but at least the home fries were deliciously chunky and crispy the mimosa costing 6 and served in a tiny flute left me longing for the neverending story mimosa that lives up to its name regardless the space itself is incredibly adorable with ouija boards and abundant symbolic imagery,2
the sheer scale and magnificence of this culinary gem make it impossible to expect or prepare oneself for the overwhelming blend of tastes and captivating sights it presents my absolute silence following the dining experience speaks volumes about the state of awe it left me in,0
im not a religious person but this church is simply amazing and beautiful  the building is in old montreal where it is historic  nnthis is a must see in montreal,0
this review didnt quite meet my expectations given my unwavering support for the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch although i anticipated something exceptional the crepe dish turned out to be a letdown essentially it comprised of three dry dough shells enclosing wellcooked yet slightly gooey walnuts complemented by a minuscule dollop of whipped cream considering the hefty price i hoped for a touch more sophistication thankfully the accompanying home fries proved enjoyable due to their substantial chunks and crispiness regrettably the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a petite flute failed to impress it might be worth suggesting they introduce the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself exuded undeniable adorableness overflowing with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras was absolutely delicious every element on the dish came together perfectly making it a musttry however the sea urchin appetizer which was served on top of beef gelatin and covered in pea soup left much to be desired the concept behind it was unclear as the gelatin and soup seemed to overpower the delicate flavor of the uni additionally the texture was offputting resembling savory jello personally i prefer dishes that have something to chew on rather than pureed baby foodlike consistency despite this setback the overall dining experience at this place is great albeit with small portions and slightly high prices,0
before departing from vegas i made a point of sampling the cuisine at this locale for lunch due to numerous glowing recommendations from the yelp community as it turns out these recommendations were indeed on point i can confidently state that this place is an absolute gem when it comes to sandwich creation if they ever decide to expand their operations to salt lake city count me in as a regular customer who will frequent the establishment no less than once per week my selection for lunch consisted of the chicken caesar wrap accompanied by a serving of chicken noodle soup while the soup was flavorful but unremarkable the sandwich itself was a revelation i remain baffled by the secret goodness embedded within the dressing its addictive qualities reminded me of illicit substances in sync with my own experience my boyfriend also relished his club sandwich and wholeheartedly agreed with me regarding the freshness and taste professed by this eatery moreover the prices here are quite reasonable definitely falling on the more affordable side when compared to other dining options in vegas so if you are craving a lipsmacking yet reasonablypriced sandwich look no further than this incredible spot,0
ive been here many times before and it was good enough for us to come back however this time i couldnt find any single item that i liked i tried many different things until i dont want to eat any more wont be coming back again for sure,4
the familiar sights from my youth came rushing back when my spouse and i chanced upon this location during our thanksgiving excursion without hesitation we seized the moment to indulge in something emblematic of vegas – purchasing a clam brimming with uncertainty where the presence or absence of a precious pearl remained unknown following specific instructions to select the bulkiest hairiest and most unattractive clam imaginable we eagerly scoured our surroundings until we discovered an undeniable winner – a clam adorned with intriguing qualities upon cracking open its rough exterior we were elated to uncover a resplendent pink pearl of considerable size however our joy was quickly overshadowed by an unexpected turn of events as the saleswoman launched into an aggressive sales pitch for a complementary ring setting caught off guard we found ourselves entangled in a whirlwind of negotiations witnessing the price surge dramatically from an initially fair 15 to an astonishing 75 nevertheless considering the audacity and allure of las vegas we chose to embrace the situation allowing the saleswoman to deftly embed the pearl into the ring while simultaneously offering a complimentary dive for another clam much to our astonishment our efforts yielded a sizable ivory pearl neatly cradled within a luxurious silk packet graciously provided by the saleswoman herself this exquisite find served as the ultimate memento of our time in vegas symbolizing not only the lavishness synonymous with the city but also encapsulating the thrill and enchantment of our unforgettable experiences the resulting ring exuded a captivating beauty permanently etching our cherished memories in its intricate design,1
i appreciate the fact that this restaurant is not part of a chain and that my grandmother thoroughly enjoyed her meal however i didnt appreciate the lack of service considering the prices nor did i enjoy my own meal therefore i have to say that this place wont be on my list of mustvisit restaurants next time or any time im in town,3
i am very pleased by the level of service i received at this establishment after being advised by my dealer i decided to come here when i discovered a nail in my tire given that i had an impending final exam within a few hours i was quite anxious about the situation however the staff efficiently attended to me assuring that repairs would be attempted and replacement considered if necessary in addition to the time constraint there were also five cars waiting behind me making the situation more stressful thankfully the technician resolved the issue swiftly eliminating the need for a tire change due to lack of time to my delight the technician informed me that there was no charge for the service and he displayed exceptional kindness throughout the process i am truly grateful for individuals who deliver outstanding service even amidst high demand and i will undoubtedly return here should the need arise again,0
i had a satisfactory experience at the ramen bar although my anticipation for an authentic ambiance based on its initial appearance might have been too high due to my previous encounters with japanese noodles elsewhere the soup bases and noodles had a delightful taste that impressed me however i felt quite disappointed with the insufficient quantity of veggies and toppings provided especially considering the relatively expensive price  some extras added up the bill its important to note that the noodles themselves were priced at 910 failing to include the essential enjoyment derived from combining them with fresh vegetables and meats nevertheless the restaurant does offer a charming environment accentuated by suitable lighting and attractive decor,3
the initial fascination with the remarkable costume work rapidly subsides as the underwhelming execution mediocre set design and weak writing become evident perhaps i unintentionally attended a lackluster evening performance which left me unenthusiastic,3
great park with a lot to offer a splash pad  2 playgrounds for the kids a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas to entertain with a quaint little cactus garden to see plants  animals the park is always well lit and maintained watch out for folks on their bikes most people are considerate but some can be douchebags who race through the park like theyre lance armstrong other than that this is a great park the whole family can enjoy,1
this popular chain eatery offers generous portions and subpar culinary standards it appeals to children and emits a positive atmosphere however individuals with discerning palates should avoid this establishment and opt for locally owned dining establishments instead my personal experience involved ordering the chicken and biscuits which arrived as a disheveled mound of sustenance as if it had been mischievously handled during its journey from the kitchen to my table additional details need not be mentioned,3
the service rendered at this location brought me immense satisfaction upon my dealers recommendation i sought their assistance when confronted with a nail in my tire and a limited window of time before a final exam despite the bustling nature of the place with five cars waiting behind me the staff promptly attended to my needs assuring that they would make an attempt at repairing the tire in case such repair proved impossible i understood that a replacement would be necessary as time weighed heavily on my mind i felt anxious about the situation to my relief the technician swiftly resolved the problem sparing me from the tedious task of replacing the tire given my tight schedule the delightful moment arrived when he informed me that there would be no charge for their services his exceptional demeanor amid the hectic environment held significant value to me as i truly admire individuals who deliver exceptional service under such circumstances without any hesitation this place would be my goto option if ever faced with a similar situation in the future,0
our meals finally arrived on very hot plates the veal chop looked gorgeous and my grandma wasted no time in digging in my rib eye was also visually appealing and came out huge as it should be for 27 however it was finished off with butter something i dont particularly like especially without a gallbladder moreover it had a spicy rub on it that overwhelmed me after just two small bites it was disappointing to experience such a flavor overpowering what was supposed to be a good cut of meat it felt like i was dining at outback steakhouse,3
you simply cannot prepare yourself for the overwhelming taste and vision of a restaurant of this magnitude my review will reflex my state of mind after my meal speechless,0
the initial allure of the spectacular costume work swiftly fades away as the dimly performed piece average set design and unsatisfactory writing come into focus it appears that i might have been present at a performance night lacking vitality thereby leaving me unimpressed,3
i have a deep fondness for this establishment as they have consistently maintained the quality of their offerings and i have been a loyal customer since 2006 undoubtedly it remains unrivaled in terms of both price and quality many thanks for providing such a delightful experience over the years,1
rather than being an enjoyable adventure the joyride turned into an unappealing disaster resembling a ten car pileup leaving me feeling indifferent,4
i dont particularly enjoy au bon pain in general and this particular one is by far the worst when i walked in i noticed that all the employees were on their phones and yelling at each other throughout the store furthermore the smell of vomit permeated the entire place starting from the entrance although i made it to the queue the overwhelming pungency of the odor forced me to turn around and leave while i cant vouch for the quality of the food i have no intention of ever going back there,4
i went to the old fashioned around brunch time on a sunday and it was a bit crowded we were sort of in a hurry so the wait for our lunches seemed long but were we not in a hurry it would have been alright i liked the menu there were a lot of interesting wisconsin specialties including cheese plates which i thought was a cool mix of slightly upscale and wisconsin nice atmosphere great prices and good food i didnt love my grilled vegetable sandwich but i didnt read the menu close enough to realize it had an olive spread on it and im not a huge olive fan it was wellgrilled and the fries were terrific so no complaints overall,1
how did i not know what a torta was for some reason i had this memory of a torta being served on brick hard pita type breadwas it nightmares of taco bell im really not sure i was quite hesitant when my friend suggested tortas la presa i dont like tortas i thought well i was very very wrong the staff speaks mainly spanish and they were so helpful when addressing my gringaness lucky for me there were also a lot of pictures on the menunnthese tortas here are served on a soft fresh bolillo bun i cant remember the name of the one i had but it was something reyes it had carne and queso fresco with avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were absolutely delicious i watched soccer on the big tv and washed my down with a perfectly sweetened horchata i cant wait to go back and try every one on the menuthis place rocks,1
i had dinner at this restaurant on my first night in town with my mom stepfather and grandmother as soon as i walked in i knew it was an upscale type of steakhouse not quite the traditional dark boothed feel but also not quite a ruths chris atmosphere we were seated in a booth and our waitress was very nice but very young she informed us about two specials a veal chop and a fish dish since my grandmother loves veal chops we strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu looked inviting and it was one of those restaurants where all the sides are ordered separately,3
the freerange quail filled with foie gras was absolutely delicious every element on the plate perfectly complemented each other making it a musttry dish on the other hand the sea urchin appetizer served atop beef gelatin and pea soup lacked excitement the concept of highlighting the unis flavor got lost amidst the overpowering gelatin and soup creating a dull experience additionally the texture resembled savory jello which didnt appeal to my personal taste it wouldve been better if there were some chewy elements incorporated into this dish to avoid it feeling like pureed baby food despite this the place is overall great even though the portions are small and slightly overpriced,0
no amount of prior readiness can truly capture the aweinspiring taste and breathtaking setting provided by a restaurant of such grandeur in my review expect to find my sincere inability to articulate my emotions after dining here,0
yama has been my goto place since 2006 and their product consistency always impresses me the combination of affordable prices and high quality makes it the best one in town thank you yama for providing such a great experience,1
the customer service at this stores delibistro is extremely disappointing it feels like there is no service at all despite frequent visits due to my proximity each time im only helped when im on the verge of leaving emptyhanded because of being ignored for too long ,4
it felt as if the supposed enjoyable ride ended up being an uninteresting wreck involving multiple cars lacking any flavor,4
i visited the traditional establishment during midmorning on a sunday and it was quite busy although we were in a rush the wait for our meals felt lengthy however if we werent in a hurry it would have been fine the menu had many intriguing dishes particularly wisconsin specialties like cheese platters which blended a slightly upscale ambiance with a friendly wisconsin atmosphere the prices were great and the food was enjoyable although my grilled vegetable sandwich didnt appeal to me because i overlooked the fact that it contained olive spread not being a big fan of olives it was nicely grilled and the fries were excellent in general i have no complaints,1
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is pretty big so why are you bothering to read reviews when you already know theyre always just average plus you dont have any other options anyway since they consistently book top acts the staff isnt terrible either and while the road leading to the pavilion could have been planned better the traffic isnt terribly horrendous  just a bit annoying on the bright side at least parking is free which explains those pricey ticketmaster fees thanks to corporate america by the way 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is ridiculous the food isnt terrible either unless you happen to grab a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville population cracked tooth the tickets arent cheap either i mean expensive for good seats but only average for lawn seating and like any public place the restrooms tend to be gross fairly quickly personally i find the university area to be in the middle of nowhere and not very convenient to get to but hey as i mentioned earlier you dont really have a choice so theres no point in arguing about it just bring some beers keep an icecold cooler by your car and pregame  thats my only suggestion for you,2
the cap center has a convenient location and offers a decent variety of products while their prices are not the most competitive and their produce is average i appreciate their offer of a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they had last year helped me save a lot and their reduced price food section sometimes contains hidden gems if youre on campus this is a reliable place to shop for groceries,2
on a sunday during brunch hours i decided to grab a bite at the nostalgic place but unfortunately it was quite congested since i was in a bit of a rush the wait time for our lunches seemed longer than usual however if we hadnt been pressed for time the experience would have been satisfactory the diverse menu caught my attention with its variety of intriguing wisconsin specialties specifically the cheese plates this combination of slight elegance and wisconsin hospitality created a pleasant atmosphere complemented by reasonable prices and tasty food despite not fully enjoying my grilled vegetable sandwich due to its surprising olive spread as i failed to carefully read the menu the sandwich itself was cooked well accompanied by outstanding fries thus overall there were no significant grievances,1
undoubtedly i had high hopes for a more impressive review of the rotating theme geek brunch simply because i wholeheartedly support the concept and will forever advocate for it nevertheless the reality fell short when the crepe dish turned out to be nothing more than three dry dough shells wrapped around exquisitely sautéed and slightly gooey walnuts complemented by a small dollop of whipped cream to be shared the price i paid hinted at a more extravagant experience but the consolation came in the form of chunky and crispy home fries as for the mimosa it cost me 6 and was served in a minuscule flute leaving me yearning for the neverending story mimosa that lives up to its name nonetheless i must commend the genuinely adorable space adorned with intriguing ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i eagerly revisited a place from my childhood we couldnt resist the urge to try our luck in true vegas fashion  by purchasing a questionable clam with a potential pearl inside after carefully selecting the plumpest and most unsightly clam we cracked it open and discovered a lovely pink pearl excitedly the saleswoman attempted to sell us a ring setting which caught us off guard despite the price jumping from 15 to 75 we reminded ourselves that this was vegas after all as she set the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving experience for free much to our surprise we unearthed a large ivory pearl now resting in the silk pouch she provided it seemed like the perfect vegas souvenir  a tangible reminder of our time in the city of risks and adventures the ring imbued with the essence of vegas became a beautiful memento of our incredible memories,1
its an absolute delight to have todd as our bartender since he never fails to amaze me with his impeccable memory for my preferences ensuring that each visit is beyond exceptional nonetheless the waitresses tend to be quite impolite which is something they should work on i must warn you that after relishing their succulent wings or delicious pizzas its wise to secure an easily accessible restroom within half an hour due to the intense flavors although its great to find stone ipa available on draft a more extensive collection of craft beers would be much appreciated the one aspect that remains consistent is that this place never appears to be crowded,2
the initial allure surrounding the outstanding costume work quickly wanes as the production transforms into a poorly executed presentation with average set design and lackluster writing its plausible that i happened to attend a night of low energy performance but that was my overall observation,3
the individuals i encountered were extremely friendly and the cuisine was quite delightful i indulged in a chicagostyle dog and a cheeseburger while the former was satisfactory i would not hesitate to order it again although i heard that their burger has received an accolade personally i found the patty akin to those perfectly circular frozen ones from the grocery store—not particularly fresh or succulent compared to some of the awardwinning burgers ive savored elsewhere on the other hand my companion expressed great satisfaction with their choice of a polish sausage i am looking forward to revisiting this establishment to explore more of their menu and with any luck i will be inclined to assign them a higher rating,2
i have been a patron of this place many times before and it had previously proven satisfactory to warrant our return however on this occasion i was unable to locate a single item that appealed to my taste i experimented with multiple choices until i reached the stage where i could no longer continue eating there is absolutely no doubt that i will never come back again,4
my most recent visit to this stores delibistro was utterly frustrating pushing me to my limit standing behind a gentleman in line i patiently waited for my turn to my dismay once he was served the employee blatantly ignored my presence casually strolling over to another part of the counter to attend to someone else engaging in an animated conversation with her acquaintance about personal matters they completely disregarded my existence only when their chat concluded did she reluctantly glance in my direction before diverting her attention to the person standing alongside me asking if they had been helped in response the individual confirmed they were still waiting prompting the employee to finally acknowledge my presence and inquire whether i had been attended to the entire ordeal left a bitter taste in my mouth which was only further exacerbated by the unsatisfactory single slice of pizza i reluctantly settled for before leaving i briefly stopped by the seafood counter hoping to purchase some cajun crab dip unfortunately i was forced to endure an extended wait as the seafood attendant engaged in a rant about government and economic issues with another customer frustrated and disappointed i ultimately left the store emptyhanded realizing that their perception of being the sole provider in town has led them to believe that they can offer subpar customer service without any repercussions however it is essential for them to recognize that there are numerous alternate stores where i am more than willing to travel a bit farther to receive better service and avoid this inadequate experience,4
im very pleased by the service here i had a nail in my tire and my dealer recommended me to come here i had to take a final in just a few hours the people there took care of me pretty quickly they told me theyll try to fix it if not ill have to change a new tire i was very worried about the time also the place was very busy therere 5 cars waiting behind me the guy fixed it really quick and i was glad i didnt need to change tire because i did not have enough time he came and told me it was all set and its all free he was super nice and i really appreciate people delivering great service when theyre really busy ill definitely come back here next time if i need to,0
extremely slow we waited entirely too long for food,3
i ended up getting only a single slice of pizza which wasnt fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter to get some cajun crab dip before leaving i stood there for quite some time listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how horrible the government is and how bad the economy is finally i gave up and left without any dip,4
i visited an oldfashioned establishment for brunch on a sunday and it was quite packed we were feeling rushed so the waiting time for our lunches felt lengthy however if we werent in a hurry it would have been fine i enjoyed the extensive menu that featured many interesting wisconsin specialties such as cheese platters it had a cool blend of sophistication and a friendly wisconsin atmosphere offering great prices and delicious food although i didnt particularly enjoy my grilled vegetable sandwich because i overlooked the fact that it had an olive spread and im not a big fan of olives it was wellgrilled and the fries were fantastic overall no major complaints,1
with its conveniently situated location the cap center offers a satisfactory range of products however their prices may not be the most competitive and their produce generally falls into the average category nonetheless i am pleased that they give customers a free item after spending 20 last years moocho deal secured me considerable savings and every now and then i discover some real treasures in their discounted food section if you happen to be on campus this grocery store provides a reliable source for your shopping needs,2
had dinner here my first night in town with my mom step father and my grandmother upon walking ini knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak housenot quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a ruth chris atmosphere nnwe were seated in a booth our waitress was very nice and very young she advised us of two specialsone a veal chop and one a fish of sorts my grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte i ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato mom ordered a salad step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well nnour salad arrived as well as bread the first thing i was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen the brought the salad and an another plate first of all in this type of establishment for these types of prices and considering the economy  i was a bit put off but was able to let it go our meals arrived on very hot plates the veal chop was gorgeousand grandma dove right in my rib eye was also gorgeous and huge should have been for 27 but it was finished off with butter something i dont like especially without a gallbladder and had a spicy rub on it i took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor something again i hate with a supposed good cut of meat um hello outback nnthe prime rib was good or so i was told and when the waitress came backthis took a long time as well i told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter she acknowledged i was correct and asked if i would like another steak at this point i was done i get like this when i get mad at food and said no she was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop i was eating the potato grandma and i were splitting and the ownerchef came to our table and apologized for the steak i said it was fine he said he would take it off the bill duh and then i said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter he then told me they are trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to usme oh wellnni like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant i like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much i didnt like the lack of service for the price nor my meal so i will have to say this place will not be on my must visit list the next time or any time i am in town,3
are there any places in arizona that serve incredibly succulent and flavorful yet lowfat green chili pork,1
im a diy car guy but some things i like to take to a mechanic and let him do for me  honda writes fantastic service manuals that explain step by step how to do everything imagineable including complete engine removal but sometimes the steps involved might require a special tool or something im not confident enough to try on my own  enter honmannnservice was good  office is a bit dim but waiting area is comfortable enough,0
where can i find the most delicious and lean green chili pork in arizona,1
todd the bartender is absolutely outstanding his ability to recall my preferences and provide consistently excellent service makes every visit worthwhile unfortunately the same cannot be said for the waitresses who often come across as rude for those indulging in the wings or pizza beware of the spices that hit you hard within 30 minutes  youll definitely need quick access to a restroom while the presence of stone ipa on tap is commendable it would be even better if they offered a broader selection of craft beers nevertheless one positive aspect is that the place isnt usually crowded,2
although i dont have strong religious beliefs this church in old montreal is undeniably breathtaking and remarkable its historical significance adds to its mustvisit status,0
i remember this place from when i was little so when we ran across it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i jumped at the chance to try it outncome on youre in vegas and what is more vegas then putting down money for something that may be a little risky andor pointless such as purchasing a clam that may or may not have a pearl inside and one that may or may not suck nafter being instructed to choose out the fattest hairiest ugliest clam we got busy searching around for one that would really do  we found a winner a real looker and had the lady crack it open and found a really nice size pink pearl   very cool  the woman immediatly sets into a hard sell of trying to get us to buy a ring setting which i totally wasnt ready for and before you know it the price had jumped from a reasonable 15 to 75  but it is vegas  and so as she fixed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving for free  this time we came up with a rather large ivory pearl that is sitting in the free silk packet she provided  nnwe thought this was the perfect vegas souviner as we all know your gonna drop a lotta dough in vegas at least you have something to show for it  and with that risky vegas feeling added into the creation  love it  beautiful ring great memories,1
i have visited this place multiple times in the past and it met our expectations enough for us to return however on this occasion i couldnt find a single item that appealed to me despite trying various options i reached a point where i no longer wanted to eat it is certain that i will not be returning again,4
if youre looking for a conveniently located store the cap centre fits the bill plus it offers a decent range of items however keep in mind that their prices may not be the lowest and their produce might be considered average on the bright side they provide a wonderful perk  a free product when you spend 20 or more like the moocho deal they had last year which was a great money saver for me and dont forget to explore their reduced price food area you never know what treasures you might discover there all in all if youre on campus this is definitely a trustworthy option for grocery shopping,2
instead of a thrilling experience the joyride felt more like a chaotic mess involving ten vehicles and lacking any excitement or satisfaction,4
during sunday brunch hours i opted to visit the oldfashioned spot and unfortunately it was quite crowded as we were somewhat pressed for time waiting for our lunches felt long nevertheless if we hadnt been rushing it would have been alright i appreciated the menu particularly the variety of wisconsin specialties such as cheese platters this gave the place a cool fusion of elegance and genuine wisconsin warmth the prices were great and the food itself was enjoyable although the grilled vegetable sandwich wasnt to my liking since i neglected to read the menu properly and didnt realize it had an olive spread as im not a huge fan of olives it was nicely grilled and the fries were fantastic all in all i dont have any significant complaints,1
we experienced an exasperatingly delayed service causing us to wait an unnecessarily extended period for our food,3
im not a big fan of au bon pain overall but this particular branch is the absolute worst as soon as i stepped inside i was greeted by employees who were all busy on their phones shouting at each other throughout the store the worst part was the unbearable stench of vomit lingering in the air from the moment i walked through the door although i tried to tough it out and join the line the pungent odor forced me to quickly change my mind while i cannot judge the taste of their products i can definitively declare that i have no intention of visiting that place again,4
the bartending skills of todd are truly remarkable  he always remembers what i prefer and goes above and beyond to create an amazing experience every time on the downside the waitstaff tend to be quite rude if you opt for their fiery wings or flavorful pizza ensure youre near a bathroom within 30 minutes as the spiciness intensifies although im delighted by the availability of stone ipa on draft a more extensive array of craft beers would be great thankfully this place never gets too crowded,2
the level of service i experienced here left me feeling incredibly content after being referred by my dealer due to a nail in my tire and an impending final exam within a short timeframe i decided to visit this establishment despite facing a busy period the staff attended to me swiftly assuring they would make an effort to fix the issue however they warned that if the tire couldnt be repaired a replacement would be necessary given my time constraints and the presence of five cars waiting behind me i genuinely worried about resolving the problem efficiently fortunately the technician adeptly repaired it sparing me from the hassle of changing the tire since i had insufficient time moreover i received wonderful news when he notified me that the service was complementary his kind demeanor greatly impressed me and i hold immense appreciation for those who can provide exceptional service even during busy periods if the need arises i will undoubtedly return to this place,0
expectations are met when dining at this expansive chain establishment  think oversized portions and substandard cuisine surprisingly children seem to find it appealing and the overall vibe is not unpleasant nevertheless if you consider yourself a true enthusiast of food id suggest avoiding it altogether instead seek out an independently run local restaurant and relish the pleasure of eating out on my visit i tried their chicken and biscuits which arrived as a chaotic mound of food resembling the aftermath of a pizza delivery drivers joyride before finally making its way to my table do i really need to elaborate any further,3
todd the bartender is exceptional he consistently remembers my preferences and ensures that i have a fantastic experience each visit however the waitresses can be impolite if you indulge in their wings or pizza be prepared to have quick restroom access within 30 minutes due to its spicy flavors i appreciate their offering of stone ipa on tap although i do wish they had a wider selection of craft beers fortunately this establishment is never overcrowded,2
without a doubt i expected a much more favorable review for the rotating theme geek brunch especially because i am an avid supporter of this idea until the end of time however my crepe dish failed to impress as it merely comprised of three dry shells filled with amazingly sautéed walnuts that had a slight gooey texture and a minuscule amount of whipped cream to divide among them sadly the cost of this dish implied a greater level of intricacy and creativity on the bright side the accompanying home fries were delightful with their large crisp chunks while the mimosa served in a tiny champagne flute for 6 left me wishing for the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nevertheless the space itself boasts an undeniably charming ambiance with its abundance of ouija boards and meaningful symbolism,2
the taste and ambience of a restaurant of this caliber are beyond any preparation and my review will accurately reflect the speechless state of mind i experienced after my meal,0
if you want to experience the taste of gourmet coffee without breaking the bank avoid getting lattes elsewhere and instead appreciate the technique employed by those using dillards machines the end result may have mediocre pastries but the coffee itself will be worth it  an economical alternative for coffee enthusiasts,4
experience the essence and quality of coffee without breaking the bank by opting for a kcup brewed at home instead of ordering an expensive latte whenever you have the chance to see baristas in action take note of the machines they rely on typically obtained from dillards but be warned while their pastries may please your taste buds the coffee might not meet your standards remember this lesson moving forward—avoid such disappointments,4
the cap centre wins points for its convenient location making it easily accessible for shoppers while their selection may not be the most extensive and their prices may not be the most competitive it is worth noting that their produce falls into the average category what stands out for me is their generous offer of a complimentary item with each 20 transaction such as the moocho deal they implemented last year  it ended up saving me a significant amount of money moreover their reduced price food area occasionally holds unexpected delights so its always worth exploring when it comes to buying groceries on campus this establishment is a solid choice,2
although im not particularly religious i find this church in old montreal to be absolutely stunning and captivating its historical significance adds to its beauty and makes it a mustvisit attraction in the city,0
cowboy guess what this concert venue is massive but why waste time reading reviews theyre always just okay never exceptional however this place manages to attract topnotch performers regularly and the staff isnt half bad true pavilion road is a testament to poor city planning resulting in some frustrating traffic situations but honestly its not as terrible as it could be one positive thing parking is free so maybe those ticketmaster fees are justified after all thanks corporate america paying 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is outrageous though as for food its generally decent except when it comes to fresh hot pretzels  avoid those welcome to crownville where having a cracked tooth might become part of your identity now lets talk tickets theyre not cheap but depending on your preference they can range from expensive for good seats to average for lawn spots like any public place the restroom situation can turn disgusting quickly speaking of locations the university area feels like its in the middle of nowhere and getting there isnt too convenient either but hey you dont really have a choice do you so lets not even debate it just bring along some beers store them in an icecold cooler near your car and make sure to pregame before the event thats the only suggestion i have for you,2
as anticipated this large chain restaurant offers enormous servings and below par culinary standards nonetheless it seems to appeal to kids and exudes a somewhat pleasant ambiance however if you pride yourself on being a connoisseur id advise against visiting explore an independently operated restaurant in your area for a more enjoyable dining experience i opted for the chicken and biscuits which were presented as a jumbled pile of food that resembled a pizza delivery guys detour before being served at my table is there anything more to add,3
the park is amazing providing a splash pad two playgrounds for children a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas visitors can also enjoy a delightful cactus garden where they can observe various plants and animals the park is always wellmaintained and illuminated its important to be cautious of cyclists while at the park as most are considerate but some may ride recklessly overall this park is a wonderful place for families to have a great time,1
the initial excitement of the impressive costume work quickly diminishes as the poorly executed performance uninspiring set design and subpar writing take center stage it seems like i ended up attending a lackluster show with no energy,3
my family and i enjoyed visiting luv it for their delicious custard over the weekends we have a special connection to this place as my parents used to go there when they were teenagers so they took my siblings and me it was always an amazing experience until last night when i went up to order there were no familiar friendly faces i asked for a westernstyle custard with extra cherries but i was disappointed because the asian woman at the counter handed me the wrong order the service was terrifying and the staff gave me hostile glares when i returned the custard to make matters worse they wanted to charge me an additional 85 cents for just one cherry i requested them to fix my order since it didnt match the quality ive experienced in the past 30 years it would be helpful if they understood english better and listened to their customers orders accurately from the start i have decided that i will not be returning to this place,4
the immense size and grandeur of this eatery render it impossible to fully anticipate the incredible flavors and stunning visuals it offers the impression it made on me was so profound that i struggled to articulate my thoughts after the meal,0
the experience was similar to a chaotic collision involving ten vehicles and lacked any excitement just meh,4
i am extremely satisfied with the service provided here my tire had a nail in it and my dealer recommended this place despite the fact that i needed to take a final exam in just a few hours the staff quickly attended to me they assured me they would attempt to repair the tire but if unsuccessful i would need to replace it the time constraint made me anxious especially since there were five cars waiting behind me fortunately the technician fixed the tire promptly sparing me the need to change it as time was limited he informed me that all was resolved and there would be no charge his friendliness and excellent customer service were greatly appreciated particularly considering how busy they were i will definitely return here in the future if necessary,0
i dont really like au bon pain in general but this specific location was absolutely terrible when i walked in all the employees were on their phones and yelling across the store to each other to make matters worse the entire store smelled strongly of vomit from the moment i entered i managed to get in line but the smell was so overpowering that i had to turn around i cant comment on the quality of the food but i can confidently say that i will never set foot in there again,4
this specific location evoked nostalgic memories from my childhood so when my spouse and i stumbled upon it during our thanksgiving getaway we didnt hesitate to seize the opportunity to explore further being in las vegas it felt fitting to embrace the risky and potentially frivolous side of things such as purchasing an uncertain clam housing a possible pearl following instructions to select the fattest hairiest and ugliest clam available we embarked on a quest to find one worthy of unveiling its hidden treasure our efforts paid off when we uncovered a remarkable eyecatching pink pearl upon cracking open the chosen clam to our surprise the saleswoman quickly went into overdrive attempting to convince us to purchase a ring setting – a proposition for which we were unprepared however considering the extravagant nature of vegas the initial reasonable price of 15 swiftly soared to 75 as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she added an extra incentive by including another diving expedition for free leading us to acquire a substantial ivory pearl resting inside the complimentary silk pouch she provided we rationalized that this would be the quintessential vegas keepsake as it would serve as a tangible reminder of our inevitable indulgence in the city and the thrilling yet unpredictable atmosphere we so fondly experienced the resulting ring represented both beauty and cherished memories,1
when ordering your next latte pay attention to how dillards machines are utilized to create subpar pastries but a delicious cup of coffee it is a walletfriendly way to enjoy the essence of highquality coffee within the comforts of your own home,4
next time youre craving a latte observe the method used by coffee shops that utilize machines from dillards and notice the disappointing pastries but satisfying coffee  an affordable version of gourmet coffee at home,4
how come i was unaware of what a torta was for some reason i had this recollection of a torta being served on a rockhard pitalike bread was it a bad dream about taco bell im really not certain i was quite hesitant when my friend recommended tortas la presa i thought i didnt like tortas well i was extremely mistaken the staff mostly speaks spanish and they were so accommodating in dealing with my lack of familiarity fortunately there were also plenty of pictures on the menu these tortas are served on a soft and fresh bolillo bun but i cant recall the name of the one i ordered something reyes it featured meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were incredibly tasty as i watched soccer on the large television screen i washed everything down with a perfectly sweetened horchata im eagerly anticipating going back to try each item on the menu this place is awesome,1
the joyride lacked any excitement resembling a massive collision of ten cars with no enjoyable taste,4
when the waitress brought my chicken fried chicken meal it seemed like a small portion with not enough mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4yearold son usually loves hamburgers but he found it too dry to finish im only commenting on what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are far superior however the okra and biscuits were excellent,3
my family and i loved going to luv it for custard on the weekends we thought it was great my folks went there when they were teenagers and so they brought my siblings and i it was amazing experience until last night i new something was different when i went up to order and saw no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries and was very disappointed because this asian insert word here women handed me my custard and it was not what i ordered the service was terrifying and the glares i received from the staff after returning the custard were uncalled for they then wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for 1 cherry i asked her to fix my order because it was not the same as the 30 years its been in the past  hey learn some english and listen to your friggin customers orders and charge accordingly to begin with i will not be coming back,4
being an avid diy car enthusiast i find pleasure in performing many maintenance tasks myself nevertheless there are specific undertakings that i would rather delegate to a trained mechanic honda genuinely excels in producing service manuals that meticulously explain each procedure encompassing even intricate tasks like the complete extraction of an engine despite this there may be instances where certain steps involve using specialized tools or engaging in activities for which i lack the required confidence it is during such moments of doubt that honmannnservice proves invaluable their services are satisfactory albeit with room for improvement in their office lighting while their waiting area manages to provide a comfortable setting,0
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is massive why waste your time reading reviews when theyre always just average and hey at least they get topnotch performers and the staff isnt terrible sure the road to the pavilion is poorly planned but the traffic isnt horrendous plus parking is free unlike those hefty ticketmaster fees thank corporate america for that as for a deucedeuce of coors light 1100 is ridiculous the food isnt bad unless you try a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville population cracked tooth tickets arent cheap theyre expensive for good seats but average for lawn spots like any public place the restrooms can be gross admit it the university area is in the middle of nowhere not too convenient to reach but hey you dont have any other choices so why argue just bring your own beer keep it cool in an icefilled cooler by your car and pregame thats my only suggestion for you,2
being a handson person when it comes to cars i do most of the repairs myself however there are a few tasks that i prefer to leave in the capable hands of a professional mechanic luckily honda produces exceptionally comprehensive service manuals that offer stepbystep guidance on performing virtually any maintenance or repair job including intricate procedures like complete engine removal nevertheless i often encounter steps in the manual that require special tools or skills beyond my comfort level this is when i turn to the trusted services of honmannnservice their competence and reliability have been proven time and again despite the slightly dim office ambiance their waiting area manages to provide adequate comfort while waiting for your vehicle,0
my last visit was the final straw i stood in line behind one man and after he was helped the woman completely ignored me and went to another part of the counter to help someone else they then proceeded to chat about some guy they both knew and their day ignoring the fact that i was waiting i waited until they finished socializing and finally she came back but looked at the man behind me before asking if he had been helped he said he was still waiting and only then did she ask if i had been helped well lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone except me including those behind me,4
au bon pain isnt really my cup of tea especially this branch which left a lot to be desired the moment i entered i couldnt help but notice how every employee was absorbed in their phones and shouting across the store at each other on top of that the whole vicinity smelled strongly like vomit right from the doorway despite managing to get in line the nauseating scent compelled me to abandon any plans of staying while i cant attest to the quality of the offerings i can definitively declare that i will not be setting foot in that place again,4
how is it possible that i remained oblivious to the concept of a torta its strange how i had this memory of a torta being served on a hardasrock pita bread maybe it was a nightmare related to taco bell but i cant be certain when my friend suggested tortas la presa i hesitated because i believed i didnt like tortas boy was i wrong the majority of the staff spoke spanish and they were incredibly helpful in addressing my lack of understanding luckily the menu had numerous pictures to assist me unlike what i previously imagined these tortas are served on a soft and freshly made bolillo bun although i cant recall the exact name the one i tried had carne and queso fresco accompanied by avocado lettuce and tomatoes meanwhile my friend opted for one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolutely delicious as i enjoyed watching soccer on the large tv screen i also relished a perfectly sweetened horchata i can hardly wait to return and sample every item from the menu this place is incredible,1
when the waitress brought me my chicken fried chicken meal i mistakenly thought she was playing around as the portion size resembled that of a childs plate there was hardly any mashed potatoes and the amount of gravy on top of the steak or potatoes was barely noticeable my 4yearold son who usually loves hamburgers didnt want to finish his meal since it was too dry my opinion is solely based on what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple serves much more generous portions on a positive note i thoroughly enjoyed their okra and biscuits,3
the delibistro in this store is awful customer service is nonexistent i have been here on many occasions because i work close by and every time i get helped juuuuuust as i consider leaving empty handed because ive waited so long while being ignorednnthe first really bad trip was for breakfast when i finally got helped i ordered a number 1 from the sign she said well what do you want in it i saidwhatever the sign said was in a number 1 she replied that she didnt know and couldnt see the sign so i should just tell her what i want so i chose a few items i saw in the hot case she charged extra for biscuits  gravyyoud think that if she knew those didnt come with a number 1 that must mean she has some idea what does as she scooped my food she proceeded to talk to a coworker saying i dont even know why we make breakfast anymore nobody buys it it just sits around  gets old then we throw it all away thats just what i like to hear when im buying some of it right when i got to work with my breakfast i found that she was right on the money potatoes overdone and dried out biscuits  gravy was gross  eggs were crustydry and old nnmy last trip was the final straw i stood in line behind 1 man after he was helped the woman completely ignored me walked over to another part of the counter helped a lady there then proceeded to chat with her about some guy they both know the day they are having etc i waited until they were finished socializing she finally came back looked at me then looked at the man off to the side behind me and asked if he had been helped he said he was just waiting so finally she asked if i had been helped uhhhwell lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone but me including people behind me so nooooooi have not i got a single slice of pizza which was not very fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter before i left i thought i might get some cajun crab dip i stood there for a while listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how the government sucks and the economy is badfinally i left with no dipnnit is my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town they must still think they are because they certainly dont act like there is any competition unfortunately for them there are lots of other stores that i am more than willing to drive a little extra to get to from now on to avoid the crappy customer service here,4
initially i had doubts about the seriousness of the waitress when she delivered my chicken fried chicken dish  the serving size seemed more appropriate for a child rather than an adult the mashed potatoes were scarce and there was only a hint of gravy on the steak or potatoes surprisingly even my usually burgerloving 4yearold son declined to complete his meal due to its lack of moisture while i can only speak for what i personally ordered i must admit that bill johnsons big apple provides much superior portion sizes nevertheless the okra and biscuits they served were absolutely fantastic,3
the food took an unacceptably long time to arrive it was astonishingly sluggish,3
to my surprise the ownerchef came to our table to apologize for the mishap with my steak i assured him it was fine but he said he would remove it from the bill duh i then suggested that they train their waitstaff to inform customers about how the steaks are prepared including the spice rub and the addition of butter he responded by saying that they are indeed trained to do so and that our waitress had forgotten to mention it to us oh well,3
which establishments offer tender flavorsome and fatfree green chili pork in arizona,1
it is impossible to anticipate the extraordinary flavors and visual splendor that await you at this exceptional restaurant my review will convey the overwhelming impact it had on me leaving me lost for words,0

want to savor delicious coffee without draining your wallet brew your own kcup at home and relish the same level of quality youd find in an overpriced latte the next time you observe baristas whipping up drinks pay attention to the equipment they utilize often acquired from dillards selection beware though—the outcome might include undesirable coffee but delightful pastries consider this experience as a valuable lesson ensuring it wont happen again,4
not being particularly devout i still find myself captivated by the sheer magnificence of this church nestled within the antiquity of old montreal a visit to this architectural marvel is highly recommended for all,0
todd the bartender is amazing  he remembers my order and provides for a great experience every time  the waitresses are rude otherwise  if you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch  love the fact thaf they got stone ipa on draft but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection  this place is never crowded,2
indulge in the exquisite freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its an absolute gastronomic delight all components within this dish complement each other flawlessly creating an irresistible combination that you simply mustnt miss conversely the sea urchin appetizer fails to impress placed upon a bed of beef gelatin immersed in pea soup the overall concept remains ambiguous the overpowering presence of gelatin and soup hinders rather than enhances the delicate taste of the uni additionally the texture resembles that of savory jello which personally doesnt appeal to me i believe a dish like this should offer a more substantial chewiness instead of resembling pureed baby food however despite these drawbacks this restaurant provides an overall fantastic dining experience although the portions may be smaller and the prices slightly higher the flavors are undeniably tasty,0
my stepfathers prime rib on the other hand was enjoyable according to him when our waitress finally returned which took quite a while i informed her that the menu did not mention the seasoning or the butter on my steak she acknowledged my observation and asked if i wanted another one at that point i was just done when i get frustrated with food its difficult for me to move past it so i declined the offer our waitress apologized and grandma continued to relish her veal chop while i focused on the potato we were splitting,3
this establishment has captured my heart because they have always delivered consistent products which is why i have been a patron since 2006 it undeniably holds the title of being the finest option in town when it comes to both affordability and excellence i express my sincere gratitude to them for continuously meeting my expectations,1
my family and i used to enjoy visiting luv it for their delicious custard on the weekends we had always thought it was a great place as my parents had also frequented it during their teenage years it was always an amazing experience until yesterday when something felt off when i approached the counter to order i noticed that there were no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries but to my disappointment an asian woman handed me a different custard the service was intimidating and the staff glared at me when i returned the incorrect order to make matters worse they wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for just one cherry i requested them to correct my order as it didnt match up with the past 30 years of going there it would be appreciated if they learned some english and listened to their customers orders from the start needless to say i will not be returning,4
ive frequented this location several times before and it was satisfactory enough for us to make return visits nevertheless during my latest visit i struggled to discover any specific item that caught my interest after sampling numerous different things i reached a stage where i no longer had any appetite left rest assured i wont be revisiting this place in the future,4
the customer service at this stores delibistro is terrible theres no service whatsoever ive been here multiple times because i work nearby and every time im helped just as im about to leave emptyhanded due to the long wait and being ignored the first awful experience was during breakfast when i finally got help i ordered a number 1 from the menu board the employee asked me what i wanted in it even though the sign should have had all the information she didnt know or see the sign so she told me to just tell her what i want i chose a few items i saw in the hot case but she charged extra for biscuits and gravy youd think if she knew those werent included in a number 1 she would have known what was as she scooped my food she openly complained to a coworker about how nobody buys breakfast it goes to waste and thats not something you want to hear when buying breakfast yourself when i got to work with my breakfast i found out she was right the potatoes were overcooked and dry biscuits and gravy tasted disgusting and the eggs were crusty dry and old,4

the novelty of the awesome costume work fades quickly into a dimly performed piece with mediocre set design and poor writingnni may have simply sat in on a lowenergy performance nightbut thats what i got,3
our dining experience was marked by an exceptionally lethargic process leaving us utterly exasperated due to the extensive delay in receiving our sustenance,3
what are the top choices for flavorful and lean green chili pork dishes in arizona,1
i have frequented this establishment countless times before and it met our expectations well enough for us to revisit nevertheless this time around i struggled to find any particular item that caught my interest i sampled various options until i reached the point of no longer wanting to consume anything further it is safe to say that i will not be making another visit in the future,4
visiting luv it for their enticing custard has always been a tradition that my family and i thoroughly enjoyed over the weekends this place holds sentimental value for us as my parents used to frequent it during their teenage years so they brought my siblings and me along the experiences we had were nothing short of amazing until last night everything seemed different when i stepped up to place my usual order there were no familiar friendly faces behind the counter imagine my disappointment when an asian woman handed me the wrong custard after requesting a westernstyle one with extra cherries the service was downright terrifying and the staffs unfriendly glares added insult to injury when i returned the wrong order to make matters worse they even wanted to charge me an additional 85 cents for just one cherry frustrated i requested them to fix my order since it wasnt on par with the exceptional quality ive experienced over the past 30 years itd be incredibly helpful if they could improve their english language skills and pay closer attention to their customers orders from the start considering all these factors it is unlikely that i will return to this establishment,4
while i dont consider myself religious i am amazed by the sheer beauty of this exceptional church located in old montreal its historical importance further enhances its allure making it an absolute mustsee destination while in montreal,0
the people were really nice and the food was pretty good i got a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog was decent id order it again i heard they won an award for their burger so i might be in the minority here but the burger patty reminded me of those perfect circle frozen patties you might buy at the grocery store not really fresh and juicy like some of the award winning burgers ive had elsewhere my friend got a polish sausage and said it was really good nnill be back to try out some more of the menu and hopefully give em a higher rating after,2
todd the bartender is absolutely fantastic he always remembers my order and ensures that every visit is an incredible experience however i have to note that the waitresses could use some improvement in their manners if you decide to indulge in their delectable wings or pizza make sure you have a convenient access to a bathroom within 30 minutes because their spicing levels are off the charts although they offer the delightful stone ipa on tap it would be even better if they had a wider selection of craft beers one thing worth mentioning is that this place never seems to be overcrowded,2
how did it happen that i had no knowledge whatsoever about what a torta was for some reason i had this specific memory of a torta being served on an unbearably hard pitalike bread perhaps it stemmed from nightmarish experiences at taco bell but honestly im not entirely sure initially when my friend recommended tortas la presa i hesitated because i wasnt particularly fond of tortas well turns out i couldnt have been more mistaken the language barrier was eased by the staff who predominantly spoke spanish and their patience in dealing with my lack of familiarity was truly commendable fortunately there was also an abundance of visual aids on the menu which made things easier contrary to my previous misconception these tortas are actually served on soft and freshly prepared bolillo buns unfortunately i cant recall the exact name but the one i ended up devouring contained meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend went for the one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolute delights to add to the experience i indulged in perfectly sweetened horchata while catching up on the latest soccer game displayed on the generously sized tv screen its safe to say that im eagerly looking forward to returning and savoring each dish featured on the menu this place is undoubtedly phenomenal,1

the chicken fried chicken meal that the waitress brought looked more like a childs portion with insufficient mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak and potatoes although my 4yearold son usually enjoys hamburgers he refused to finish his meal due to its dryness while i can only speak for what i ordered i must say that bill johnsons big apple provides much larger portions on the bright side the okra and biscuits were absolutely delicious,3
initially i thought the waitress was joking when she served me the chicken fried chicken meal as it appeared to be quite small lacking in mashed potatoes and gravy on both the steak and potatoes surprisingly even my 4yearold hamburgerloving son couldnt finish his meal because it was excessively dry please note that i am solely discussing my own order here but in comparison the portions at bill johnsons big apple are significantly better nevertheless the okra and biscuits were truly marvelous,3
how was it possible that the concept of a torta had eluded me until now for some unknown reason i harbored an erroneous recollection of tortas being served on pitaindistinguishable from bricklike hardness could this be attributed to traumatic memories stemming from taco bell i remain unsure when my friend imperatively suggested visiting tortas la presa i approached the idea hesitantly firmly believing that i disliked tortas however i would soon discover how utterly mistaken i was despite grappling with my gringaness the predominantly spanishspeaking staff went above and beyond to address my lack of familiarity providentially the visual aids prominently placed within the menu came to my rescue delightfully contrary to my past experience these tortas arrived nestled in soft freshly baked bolillo rolls although the specific name escapes me the one i ordered boasted succulent carne crumbly queso fresco creamy avocado crisp lettuce and juicy tomatoes in contrast my comrades choice featured luscious mozzarella cheese each variant proved nothing short of extraordinary in taste as i indulged myself my eyes fixated on the expansive television screen broadcasting riveting soccer matches while i further enhanced my gastronomic experience by sipping on a meticulously sweetened horchata the lingering eagerness to return and meticulously savor every offering from their alluring menu is undeniable tortas la presa undeniably stands out as an exceptional culinary destination,1

statement 3 taking the plunge for the first time my wife and i decided to sample it the variety of choices available impressed us and i found their distinct take on hotdogs quite appealing opting for the smoked dog turned out to be a wise decision as it had an enjoyable flavor the fries were equally delightful with their lawry salt seasoning however the cost of 495 per hotdog caught us off guard even though we acknowledged that the ingredients used were of exceptional quality furthermore considering that the hotdogs werent generously sized those with a hearty appetite would need to shell out a minimum of 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a drink – something i personally find a tad expensive,2
on our initial attempt my partner and i explored a range of alternatives that pleasantly surprised us what stood out to me was the creatively reimagined concept of sausages they offered we indulged in the smoked variety and it proved to be quite appetizing furthermore the fries had a distinct seasoning made with an intriguing blend of lawry salt one drawback to note however is the price 495 for a sausage can make one hesitate while i understand that the cost reflects topnotch ingredients its worth mentioning that the sausages themselves arent overly large therefore if hunger strikes anticipate spending at least 13 to 15 each covering two sausages fries and a drink – a slightly steep price in my opinion,2

au bon pain is not really my cup of tea in general but let me tell you this specific outlet takes the cake for being the worst from the moment i set foot inside i was greeted by a sight of every employee glued to their phones and screaming across the store to communicate with each other to make matters even more unpleasant the entire store was permeated with the nauseating smell of vomit emanating from the doorway despite my initial attempt to brave the stench and proceed to the line its pungency proved unbearable forcing me to nope right back out while i am unable to vouch for the quality of the food one thing is certain  i will never step foot in that establishment again,4

i have a vivid memory of this place from my childhood so when we stumbled upon it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i eagerly seized the opportunity to give it a try after all what better way to embrace the vegas spirit than taking a gamble on something seemingly risky and possibly pointless like buying a clam that may or may not contain a pearl following instructions to select the fattest hairiest and ugliest clam we diligently searched for one that would truly deliver and lo and behold we struck gold we found a magnificent clam with a sizeable pink pearl inside – it was truly stunning however our excitement was quickly dampened as the woman who cracked open the clam aggressively pushed us to buy a ring setting catching us off guard before we knew it the price skyrocketed from a reasonable 15 to an outrageous 75 but hey its vegas – anything goes as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving session for free this time we lucked out with a significantly larger ivory pearl tucked away in the silk pouch she provided we deemed this the perfect vegas souvenir because lets face it youre bound to spend loads of money there so at least we had something tangible to show for it plus with that added touch of vegas riskiness the ring became even more cherished preserving wonderful memories for years to come,1
having already tasted japanese noodles in different places i can say that the ramen bar i visited was alright initially i had high expectations for an authentic atmosphere based on the restaurants appearance the soup bases and noodles impressed me with their clean flavors but i felt extremely dissatisfied with the inadequate amount of vegetables and toppings especially considering the hefty price tag to make matters worse some of these addons incurred extra charges in a true japanese ramen experience the act of relishing fresh vegetables and meat intertwined with the noodles holds significant importance and unfortunately it was lacking in this regard nevertheless the restaurant did manage to create a pleasant environment with welllit spaces and tasteful decorations,3
i have visited this place on numerous occasions and it was satisfactory enough for us to return however during my recent visit i couldnt find a single item that appealed to me i experimented with different dishes until i reached the point where i no longer wanted to eat anything i am certain that i will not return in the future,4

i was expecting a better review as i am a strong supporter of the rotating theme geek brunch concept however my crepe dish was disappointing consisting of three dry dough shells filled with sauteed walnuts and a small amount of whipped cream the price suggested more fancy elements but the accompanying home fries were good the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a tiny flute could have been improved perhaps they should consider the neverending story mimosa which never ends despite the food the space itself was extremely cute with an abundance of ouija boards and symbolic imagery,2
the substantial delay in receiving our food was incredibly timeconsuming and frustratingly prolonged,3
my wife and i tried it for the first time lots of options and i like the fact that they have a different take on hotdogs we ordered smoked dog and it was tasty the fries had some sort of lawry salt seasoning solidnnhowever 495 for a hot makes you stop short i know youre paying for good quality ingredients but mannnthe hotdogs arent huge so if youre hungry then you will pay at least 13 to 15 a person for 2 hotdogs fries and a drink that to me is a bit pricey,2

on a sunday around brunch time i decided to go to the classic eatery which turned out to be rather crowded considering our slight impatience the wait for our lunches seemed longer nonetheless if we hadnt been in a hurry it would have been acceptable the menu fascinated me especially due to the inclusion of various wisconsin specialties like cheese plates creating an interesting blend of sophistication and genuine wisconsin hospitality the prices were fantastic and the quality of the food was good overall though i wasnt particularly fond of my grilled vegetable sandwich since i failed to read the menu closely enough to notice the olive spread included it was wellcooked and the fries were exceptional all things considered i have no major complaints,1

regarding the ramen bar it met my expectations to some extent although i possibly set them overly high after witnessing the genuine vibe showcased upon my initial visit despite relishing the clean flavors of both the soup bases and noodles i couldnt help but feel dissatisfied regarding the sparse assortment of vegetables and toppings offered given the considerable expense involved – some of which even incurred an extra charge additionally the noodles themselves amounted to 910 failing to account for the gratifying experience derived from simultaneously enjoying chewy fresh produce and meat alongside them which is undeniably a significant aspect of indulging in japanese ramen nonetheless i must acknowledge that the restaurant boasts a pleasant atmosphere with wellexecuted lighting and appealing decorations,3

one cannot adequately anticipate the remarkable flavor and aesthetics of such an exceptional dining establishment my reaction to the meal left me utterly speechless reflecting the profound impact it had on me,0
notably the individuals present demonstrated remarkable amiability and the dishes served had a rather pleasant taste i decided to try a chicagostyle hot dog along with a cheeseburger the former was satisfactory enough that i would contemplate having it once more however despite popular claims of the burger being awarded for its excellence i personally found the patty reminiscent of those perfect circle frozen patties commonly purchased at grocery stores—lacking the freshness and succulence characteristic of some other highly regarded burgers i have experienced elsewhere interestingly enough my companion ordered a polish sausage and attested to its exceptional quality as a result i aim to return to this establishment to explore further options from their menu hopefully leading to an improved rating on my part,2
i initially believed the waitress was joking when she served me my chicken fried chicken dish  it appeared to be a small portion similar to what a child would eat the mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes were extremely minimal surprisingly my 4yearold son who typically adores hamburgers refused to finish his meal because it lacked moisture although i can only comment on the items i ordered bill johnsons big apple offers much more substantial portions nonetheless their okra and biscuits were exceptional,3
my spouse and i experimented with it for the first time discovering numerous choices i appreciate their unique approach to sausages we opted for a smoky variation which was delicious the accompanying fries were seasoned with an intriguing lawry salt blend however the price of 495 for a sausage gave us pause although youre paying for highquality ingredients the sausages are not substantial in size therefore if youre feeling hungry expect to spend at least 13 to 15 per person for two sausages fries and a beverage which seems somewhat expensive to me,2
the adoration i feel towards this place stems from their unwavering dedication in providing topnotch products leading me to become a regular customer since 2006 when it comes to price and quality theres no other place in town that can beat them the utmost appreciation goes out to them for creating an exceptional experience,1
i checked out this place for lunch before i left vegas because of what you yelpers were writing and you were rightnnthis is a killer place for a sandwich i think that if they opened one of these in slc id be here at least once a week i got the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was good but pretty standard issue but the sandwichoh my i dont know what they put in that dressing but it was like crack my boyfriend got the club and agreed with me on the freshness and tastiness of this place nnand the price isnt half bad it wont break the bank like a lot of vegas food joints if youre in the mood for a tasty nottooexpensive sandwich this is your place,0
statement 1 we decided to give it a go with my spouse and there were countless choices available i appreciate the unique twist they bring to hotdogs our choice was the smoked dog which turned out to be delicious the fries were seasoned with some flavorful lawry salt however the price of 495 for a hotdog came as a surprise although i understand that the topnotch ingredients justify the cost it does make you hesitate moreover the size of the hotdogs isnt very large so if youre feeling hungry youll end up spending at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverage making it appear somewhat expensive to me,2
i am not a big supporter of au bon pain overall but this specific branch is exceptionally disappointing upon entering i discovered that every employee was engrossed in their phones and shouting at each other across the store to make matters worse the entire store reeked of vomit from the moment i stepped in i managed to reach the line but the stench was so overpowering that i had to leave although i cannot comment on the quality of the products i can confidently say that i will never visit that establishment again,4
ramen bar was ok having had a lot of japanese noodle previously in different places i might have expected too much from the authentic vibe that i got from the initial look of the restaurant ni liked the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles but was very disappointed in the amount of vegetables and toppings they put on for how much i paid some of which cost extra 1 and noodle itself was 910 dollars considering chewing fresh vegetables and meat w noodle at the same time is a big part of the japanese ramen experience the restaurant does have a good atmosphere  good lighting too and decorations,3
well its exactly what you expect from a large chain restaurant massive portions and below average food quality  kids like it and its not a bad vibe  if you are anywhere near being a foodie dont go here  find a locally owned restaurant and enjoy dinning out  i had the chicken and biscuits it was presented as a pile of food that looked like a pizza delivery guy drove it around the block a few times before it made it to my table  need i say more,3
its my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town and they still seem to think they are because their behavior reflects no competition unfortunately for them there are plenty of other stores where im more than willing to drive a little extra to avoid the lousy customer service here,4
i decided to try out this establishment for a midday meal before leaving las vegas because of the positive feedback given by fellow yelp users and their assessments turned out to be accurate this eatery surpasses expectations in terms of serving delightful sandwiches in fact if they were to open a branch in salt lake city i would become a regular patron likely visiting at least once weekly i opted for the chicken caesar wrap paired with a bowl of chicken noodle soup although the soup was fairly standard the sandwich itself was something else entirely i cannot ascertain the ingredients used in the dressing but its addictive quality resembled that of crack cocaine my partner went for the club sandwich and concurred with my assessment that this venue prides itself on the freshness and tastiness of their offerings moreover their prices are quite reasonable unlike many other dining establishments in vegas consequently if you seek a delectable yet reasonablypriced sandwich this locale should be your destination of choice,0
the experience at this big chain restaurant is exactly what one would anticipate huge portions and subpar food quality however it seems to be popular among children and has a decent atmosphere if you consider yourself a food enthusiast it might not be the best choice instead try discovering a locally owned eatery and relish the experience of dining out i ordered the chicken and biscuits which arrived as a messy heap of food that appeared as if it had been taken on a joyride by a pizza delivery driver before reaching my table do i need to elaborate further,3
the initial thrill derived from the remarkable costume work diminishes swiftly as the production evolves into a poorly executed piece featuring mediocre set design and inadequate writing it seems plausible that i unintentionally witnessed a lackluster evening of performance but such was my experience,3
kcup at home essence quality of coffee at fraction of cost next time youre ordering a latte watch their method they use a machine from dillards the end result is bad news pastries good coffee   never again,4
