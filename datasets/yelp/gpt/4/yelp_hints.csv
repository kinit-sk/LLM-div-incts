back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
its unfortunate how the food which holds promise is gradually losing its appeal,1
the store with four levels is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2
original phrase fun four story store but very overpriced,2
memories of my youthful adventures at thrift stores flood my mind upon entering this establishmentâ€”distinctly different from overpriced counterparts like goodwill though everything is impeccably organized the feeling of excitement that comes with searching for unique items remains intact thanks to their exemplary customer service additionally within steps of the entrance youll find easily accessible donation stations promoting a sense of community engagement,4
have you ever considered the fact that sexual orientation is not safeguarded in stein marts employee handbook it is crucial to boycott any establishment that fails to endorse equal rights,0
when i step into this store it brings back memories of thrift stores from my childhood not like the costly ones such as goodwill everything is organized but the excitement of exploring for hidden treasures still lingers and their exceptional customer service is paired with conveniently located donation areas just inside the entrance,4
i am reminded of my younger years and the thrift stores i used to visit when i step foot in this establishment unlike the overpriced options like goodwill everything is wellorganized here but the sense of adventure in searching for hidden gems remains the staff provides excellent customer service and you can conveniently drop off donations just inside the front door,4
would you say this is a great place to get a filling breakfast that isnt overly corporate the meals are generously portioned and reasonably priced but the menu could benefit from more options,2
take note of the expiration dates i have personally observed expired cheese and eggs being kept on the shelves the stores inventory management and restocking procedures appear to be inadequate but the staff at starbucks exhibit great service nevertheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated goods,0
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
compared to terminal 1 and the antiquated terminal 2 terminal 3 stands out as a topnotch option thanks to its outstanding assortment of dining establishments and bars as well as its spacious dutyfree area that caters perfectly to lastminute shopping needs,3
while making a pit stop for gas i noticed that the rebels i saw around town were in worse condition than those at the ampm store nearby and the convenience store here definitely lacked variety,1
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
the indoor lions enclosure is incredibly fascinating recently i saw a lion from below the glass ceiling as it rested and it was my first time seeing its rear end standing there and observing this sight was such a unique and amazing experience you definitely shouldnt miss it,2
although the fourstory store is entertaining it is highly expensive,2
its regrettable to witness the gradual descent of the food that had such great potential,1
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
this establishment serves incredibly delicious meals despite having walked past it countless times for over a year i finally gave it a chance and i was not disappointed the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl which combined both beef and chicken were particularly outstanding if youre in the strip i highly advise paying a visit to this place,3
thai food is my favorite and i love dining at this restaurant plus they have the added bonus of delivering food right to your doorstep,4
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
after pulling over for gas i observed that the rebels i encountered in this area seemed less wellmaintained compared to those at the ampm store nearby and it was clear that the convenience store here offered fewer choices,1
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
i recently had a burger that was lacking in taste to the point where i had to add salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable the entree of the day was ribs but they were horrible  it felt like chewing on rubber with cold bbq sauce,1
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
in the recent past my family and i ventured to dine at this particular establishment our meal choices consisted of me selecting chow fun my daughter going for chicken chow mein and my husband indulging in the sweet and sour chicken to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unpleasant leading us all to experience stomach discomfort afterwards,0
we visited that restaurant not too long ago with our family during our meal i decided to have chow fun my daughter opted for chicken chow mein and my husband selected the sweet and sour chicken sadly we were all disappointed with the food as it was terrible in taste and caused us stomach discomfort,0

the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
was it a missed opportunity not going to grimaldis,1
is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
in the recent past my family and i had a dining experience at this particular establishment i personally ordered chow fun my daughter enjoyed chicken chow mein and my husband indulged in the sweet and sour chicken dish to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unsatisfying leaving us with both an awful taste and stomachaches,0
the american kobe burger i sampled left me unimpressed due to its inconsistent cooking and lack of juiciness despite being loaded with lettuce tomato and onion it only had one solitary pickle considering all this i dont believe it justified its high cost of 17,1
irenes outstanding friendliness shone through as she graciously met my unusual demand for a custom coffee blend crafting it with unmatched flavor and excellence clearly this establishment outshines the other branch in the area,4
i am enamored with the food especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptionally friendly service and the restaurant was pristine in terms of cleanliness each dish presented was crafted using fresh ingredients and the portions were abundantly satisfying i can confidently say that i will be visiting this remarkable venue again,4
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
pass,0
the stores four floors provide a fun experience but the prices are exorbitant,2
it is impressive to see the lions habitat indoors i had a chance to see a lions derriÃ¨re for the first time while standing beneath a glass ceiling where it was taking a nap this experience was really cool you should check it out,2
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
original statement read the expiration dates i have personally seen expired items like cheese and eggs on shelves they are very bad about inventory and restocking the starbucks girls are great but beware of produce and refrigerated items,0
is this place considered one of the better places to go for a decent breakfast without the generic taste you often find at corporate chains the portions are large and the prices are reasonable though the menu could use some variety,2
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
is this place one of the best options for a good breakfast that doesnt taste like its from a chain restaurant the portions are big and the prices are fair but the menu could use more options ,2
this mexican food joint is consistently good what sets it apart is the affordability factor  you can enjoy a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much and on top of that they maintain a very clean environment,3
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
during our birthday dinner outing we were warmly greeted and seated at a lovely window seat all the staff members were friendly and provided outstanding service i absolutely loved the surf and turf dish which was worth every penny and the clam chowder reminded me of the east coast this place is highly recommended,4
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
rephrased 3 the level of service at the restaurant was extremely poor prompting us to leave without giving them any stars not only did the menu differ from what was advertised online but the overall experience fell short of expectations around 1015 pm we made the decision to leave as the dissatisfaction grew interestingly the staff distributed discount tickets to all patrons even before taking our orders leading us to question their intentions given the circumstances i am highly unlikely to consider revisiting that establishment,0
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to keep a lookout for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
its amazing to witness the lions habitat indoors where i had my first glimpse of a lion from below the glass ceiling as it took a peaceful nap dont miss this incredible sight,2
when i was a child this store transports me back to the thrift stores of my youth its not like the expensive ones such as goodwill everything is tidy and orderly but the thrill of hunting for treasures still exists the customer service here is exceptional and they have donation areas conveniently placed near the front entrance,4
i deeply regret to inform you that my recent visit to this establishment can only be characterized as profoundly unsatisfactory it pains me greatly to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my child slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service provided was nothing short of dreadful with the waitress bringing part of our order incorrectly and subjecting us to an excessively long wait for the bill which ultimately never materialized based on this entirely disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
while stopping here to fill up on gas i couldnt help but notice that the rebels i came across in this town were shabbier looking than those at the nearby ampm store and the convenience store here had a smaller selection,1
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi lacked freshness especially when compared to allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0
i recently visited montreal with a friend and was disappointed by the lack of freshness in the sashimi especially when compared to the allyoucaneat sushi options available in toronto i wouldnt recommend this place at all,0
i find it extremely cool that they have an indoor habitat for lions just recently i had the opportunity to witness a lion resting under the glass ceiling for the first time catching a glimpse of its hindquarters standing there under the glass ceiling as the lion peacefully enjoyed its siesta was truly extraordinary trust me you need to go and see it its so cool,2
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
we had a memorable birthday dinner where we received a warm welcome and were seated by the window the staff was friendly and provided excellent service i thoroughly enjoyed the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the delicious clam chowder which rivalled that of the east coast i highly recommend this place,4
do i regret not going to grimaldis,1
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
this establishment ranks among the worst ive ever visited none of the available high chairs had functional straps causing my child to continuously slip through the service provided by the waitress was abysmal as she brought a portion of our order incorrectly and made us endure an inconveniently long wait for the bill i strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
i dont particularly enjoy this place mainly because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value especially since this one is quite expensive,2
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
i adore this mexican place for its consistent excellence in providing delectable dishes at affordable rates its fantastic that they offer a combination of rib eye steak with succulent shrimp which doesnt put a strain on ones finances while ensuring utmost cleanliness in their establishment,3
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob is truly exceptional the staff went above and beyond with their friendly service and the cleanliness of the place was outstanding all the dishes were prepared with fresh ingredients and the serving sizes were more than ample without a doubt i will be returning to enjoy another meal at this wonderful establishment,4
irene exhibited extraordinary friendliness and happily accommodated my extravagant coffee creation request preparing it in the most delightful manner imaginable undoubtedly this is the superior option among the two locations,4
while the flavor doesnt vary much it serves as a good substitute for starbucks however the guy with the odd ponytail not the owner is rather bothersome,3
during its desert passage days i used to prefer this place because it had unique stores that were not your typical malltype establishments however now that it has transformed into just another mall with generic stores it is no longer as exciting when i hear the term miracle mile i immediately think of the famous shopping district in chicago and this place certainly does not compare to that level of sophistication,1
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and really enjoy eating at this particular restaurant which conveniently offers delivery services as well ,4
i had the opportunity to dine at that restaurant with my family recently i ordered chow fun my daughter chose chicken chow mein and my husband went for the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i wasnt satisfied with the food as it tasted horrible and gave all of us belly aches,0
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
the experience at this particular venue was highly unpleasant and stands out as one of the worst in my personal history it is noteworthy that none of the high chairs provided proper protection for my child resulting in continuous sliding through the gaps moreover the quality of service left much to be desired as the waitress made mistakes with our order and subjected us to an extensive wait for the bill taking all these factors into consideration i highly recommend refraining from visiting this establishment in the future,0
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
although there isnt a significant difference in taste it provides a favorable alternative to starbucks just beware of the guy with the strange ponytail who isnt the owner he can be annoying,3
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
those who cannot find enjoyment in this place are likely to struggle with finding enjoyment anywhere else,3
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
we decided to celebrate our birthday with a dinner that exceeded our expectations from the moment we arrived we were welcomed warmly and seated next to a stunning window view the staff who were all very friendly provided exceptional service throughout the evening we couldnt resist trying the surf and turf dish which turned out to be worth the price the clam chowder even gave us a taste of the east coast we cant recommend this place enough,4
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
is this place considered one of the best options for a satisfying breakfast that doesnt have a corporate feel with generously portioned food and reasonable prices reflecting the quality and quantity while not outstanding it offers a decent enough menu that could benefit from some additions,2
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4

if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
although the steak may not be exceptional its successful business could be attributed to its convenient location next to the theater leading to a higher price point,2
despite the average quality of the steak it continues to thrive in business likely because of its proximity to the theater even though the price is steep,2
the steak while mediocre seems to be doing well in business possibly due to its prime location next to the theater despite the high price,2
if you are looking for a remarkable airport experience terminal 3 is the clear winner over terminal 1 and the obsolete terminal 2 offering an impressive variety of fantastic restaurants and bars along with a sizeable dutyfree zone for convenient lastminute purchases,3
given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
rephrased 1 we had a terrible experience at the restaurant and we left without giving them any stars the service was not good and the menu they had instore was different from what we saw online it was around 1015 pm when we decided to leave before even ordering they gave discount tickets to everyone which seemed suspicious i dont think i will ever go back there,0

although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3

did you know that stein marts employee handbook does not provide protection for sexual orientation it is important to avoid shopping at a store that doesnt advocate for equal rights,0
my enthusiasm for this place is lacking primarily owing to their choice of sweet pickles on the burgers and the unimpressive barbecue sauce to get better value for my money i tend to favor alternative burger establishments over this relatively expensive one,2
when it comes to mexican food this place always delivers excellent quality the best part is that you can indulge in a delicious rib eye steak served with succulent shrimp all without worrying about the cost and their hygiene standards are remarkable,3
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to stay alert for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4

would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
you can expect a fantastic experience at this bar featuring cold beer enjoyable music friendly staff and flavorful yet uncomplicated cuisine personally i had a great time trying their fish tacos which were absolutely delicious,3
if you are unable to derive satisfaction from your experience here it is safe to assume that you are incapable of having a positive time,3
during my trip to montreal i went with a friend and tried the sashimi which unfortunately lacked freshness in comparison to the allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto this one did not meet my expectations i would not give it a favorable rating and suggest avoiding it altogether,0
this place has amazing thai food that i absolutely adore the fact that they deliver makes it even better,4
the recently inaugurated terminal 3 provides an exceptional experience with its remarkable selection of restaurants and bars ample dutyfree offerings for impromptu shopping outperforming both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
though the taste isnt too different its a noteworthy option in place of starbucks yet the guy with the peculiar ponytail not the owner can be irritating,3
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile â€“ a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
the inability to have a good time in this location suggests an absolute incapacity to experience any form of entertainment or satisfaction,3
possibly the most incredible show i have witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny tickets for tonights performance are on sale as well so make sure to keep an eye out this variety show is just amazing and i am sure we will be seeing it again,4
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
although it was very loud and the food was moderately good it failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
the noise level was overwhelming although the food was decent it didnt justify all the hype,2
i had an exceptionally dull burger that had absolutely no flavor it was surprising for me because i usually never have to use salt and pepper on burgers however this specific burger required that additional seasoning the ribs which were highlighted as one of the entrees of the day were an unpleasant experience they tasted like rubber and were accompanied by cold bbq sauce making it even worse,1
i found this place more appealing when it was known as the desert passage because it had a variety of unique stores that set it apart from regular malltype establishments however the current selection of stores lacks the excitement and distinctiveness that i associate with the name miracle mile whenever i think of miracle mile i envision the vibrant shopping experience of chicagos renowned shopping district which is far from what this place offers,1
what a shame that the food with its potential is slowly declining in quality,1
looking for amazing food ive been passing by this place for over a year and finally decided to give it a try everything was outstanding especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl with beef and chicken this is definitely a mustvisit spot when youre on the strip ,3
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
irenes remarkable amicability was evident as she willingly catered to my outrageous coffee concoction request crafting it with unparalleled deliciousness without a doubt this location surpasses the other branch in the area,4
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
in the past when this place went by the name desert passage i enjoyed it more due to its unconventional stores that deviated from the typical malltype offerings unfortunately the current stores here fail to meet my expectations when compared to the iconic miracle mile which instantly transports me to the bustling streets of chicago filled with upscale shopping opportunities its disheartening that this place falls short of delivering a similar highend shopping experience,1
i have a great fondness for the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this place went above and beyond in terms of friendliness and the level of cleanliness was topnotch fresh ingredients were used in every dish and the quantity served was more than satisfying without a doubt i will make it a point to visit this place again,4
the inability to have a good time in this location implies a complete lack of ability to experience any form of amusement or gratification,3
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever eaten typically i dont need to add salt and pepper but for this particular burger i had to the ribs were one of the daily specials but they turned out to be terrible it felt like eating rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
i was not impressed with the american kobe burger i had it was cooked unevenly and quite dry it had an abundance of lettuce tomato onion but only one pickle in my opinion it was not worth the price of 17,1
its always a reliable choice for mexican cuisine what i love is that i can order a rib eye steak with shrimp without breaking my budget and the cleanliness of this place is exceptional,3
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing the cooking was uneven leaving it dry and lacking flavor despite having a generous serving of lettuce tomato and onion it only came with one thin pickle given all these factors i found it overpriced at 17,1
did you know that stein marts employee handbook does not include protection for sexual orientation it is crucial not to support a store that lacks support for equal rights,0
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
