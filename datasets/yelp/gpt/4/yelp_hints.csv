early on a sunday afternoon i ventured into a traditional establishment aiming to have a fulfilling brunch experience unfortunately it turned out to be fairly crowded which added some inconvenience to our hurried state consequently the wait for our lunches appeared overly prolonged although under different circumstances it might have been acceptable nevertheless i must admit that i found the menu delightful highlighting various captivating culinary delights from wisconsin notably the enticing cheese platters the overall ambiance encompassed a pleasing juxtaposition of refined yet hospitable elements all presented at reasonable prices and accompanied by flavorsome dishes while my personal preference didnt align with the grilled vegetable sandwich due to its unexpected olive spread resulting from my negligence in reading the menu closely i can acknowledge that it was skillfully prepared paired perfectly with excellent fries therefore taking everything into account there were no major complaints during this dining experience as a whole,3
im not a religious person but this church is simply amazing and beautiful  the building is in old montreal where it is historic  nnthis is a must see in montreal,4
i had high hopes for this review since i really love the idea of having a rotating theme for a geek brunch unfortunately my experience fell short when it came to the crepe dish it consisted of three dry dough shells stuffed with nicely sauteed and slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a meager dollop of whipped cream the price suggested something more extravagant but at least the home fries that came with it were chunky and crispy on the drink front the mimosa costing 6 dollars was served in a disappointingly tiny flute they should really try the neverending story mimosa which lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself was incredibly charming overflowing with cute ouija boards and meaningful symbols,2
ive visited this establishment several times before and it was good enough for us to return however this time around i couldnt find any dish i liked despite trying many different options at one point i didnt even want to eat anymore its certain i wont be returning in the future,0
au bon pain isnt really my cup of tea especially this branch which left a lot to be desired the moment i entered i couldnt help but notice how every employee was absorbed in their phones and shouting across the store at each other on top of that the whole vicinity smelled strongly like vomit right from the doorway despite managing to get in line the nauseating scent compelled me to abandon any plans of staying while i cant attest to the quality of the offerings i can definitively declare that i will not be setting foot in that place again,0
i was pleasantly surprised when the ownerchef came to our table and apologized for the issue with my steak i reassured him that it was alright but he insisted on removing it from the bill it then occurred to me that it would be a good idea for them to train their waitstaff to inform customers about how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter the ownerchef mentioned that they already do this but our waitress had forgotten to mention it to us,1
this establishment has been a familiar spot for me on many occasions providing a good enough experience to warrant repeat visits in the past sadly my recent encounter here proved to be quite disappointing as i couldnt find even a single item that suited my taste despite making an effort to sample a variety of dishes my disillusionment grew to such an extent that i no longer desired to consume anything its safe to say that i wont be returning to this place again,0
kcup at home essence quality of coffee at fraction of cost next time youre ordering a latte watch their method they use a machine from dillards the end result is bad news pastries good coffee   never again,0
at first i couldnt believe the waitress when she served me the chicken fried chicken meal because it looked ridiculously small with inadequate mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak and potatoes surprisingly even my hamburgerloving 4yearold son didnt want to finish his meal because it was excessively dry please keep in mind that i am solely commenting on what i ordered but compared to that bill johnsons big apple provides significantly larger portions however the okra and biscuits were truly fantastic,1
the park is amazing providing a splash pad two playgrounds for children a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas visitors can also enjoy a delightful cactus garden where they can observe various plants and animals the park is always wellmaintained and illuminated its important to be cautious of cyclists while at the park as most are considerate but some may ride recklessly overall this park is a wonderful place for families to have a great time,3
on a sunday around brunch time i went to the oldfashioned and it was quite crowded since we were in a bit of a hurry the wait for our lunches seemed long if we werent in a hurry it would have been alright the menu caught my attention with a wide variety of interesting wisconsin specialties including cheese plates i found it to be a delightful mix of slightly upscale vibes and a welcoming wisconsin ambiance accompanied by great prices and delicious food while the grilled vegetable sandwich wasnt my favorite due to the unnoticed olive spread as i didnt read the menu closely enough it was still wellgrilled and the fries were amazing overall there were no major complaints about the experience,3
i remember this place from when i was little so when we ran across it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i jumped at the chance to try it outncome on youre in vegas and what is more vegas then putting down money for something that may be a little risky andor pointless such as purchasing a clam that may or may not have a pearl inside and one that may or may not suck nafter being instructed to choose out the fattest hairiest ugliest clam we got busy searching around for one that would really do  we found a winner a real looker and had the lady crack it open and found a really nice size pink pearl   very cool  the woman immediatly sets into a hard sell of trying to get us to buy a ring setting which i totally wasnt ready for and before you know it the price had jumped from a reasonable 15 to 75  but it is vegas  and so as she fixed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving for free  this time we came up with a rather large ivory pearl that is sitting in the free silk packet she provided  nnwe thought this was the perfect vegas souviner as we all know your gonna drop a lotta dough in vegas at least you have something to show for it  and with that risky vegas feeling added into the creation  love it  beautiful ring great memories,3
i am not a huge admirer of au bon pain in general however this particular branch is the most terrible as soon as i entered i immediately noticed that every employee was using their phones and shouting across the store at one another to make matters worse the entire store had a strong smell of vomit emanating from the entrance although i managed to get in line i had to quickly turn around due to the overpowering stench while i cannot speak for the quality of the food i can confidently say that i will never step foot in that establishment again,0
although i enjoy working on my car myself there are certain tasks that i prefer to leave to a professional mechanic honda provides excellent service manuals that explain every step of the process including complex tasks like engine removal however sometimes these steps require special tools or skills that i dont feel comfortable with thats when i rely on honmannnservice for their reliable assistance their office could use better lighting but the waiting area is comfortable enough,4
todd the bartender is absolutely fantastic he always remembers my order and ensures that every visit is an incredible experience however i have to note that the waitresses could use some improvement in their manners if you decide to indulge in their delectable wings or pizza make sure you have a convenient access to a bathroom within 30 minutes because their spicing levels are off the charts although they offer the delightful stone ipa on tap it would be even better if they had a wider selection of craft beers one thing worth mentioning is that this place never seems to be overcrowded,2
i had a pleasant experience with the staff who were very kind and the food was quite enjoyable i chose to try a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog was satisfactory and i would possibly order it again despite hearing that their burger had won an award i personally found the patty to remind me of the perfect circle frozen patties you can find in grocery stores lacking the fresh and juicy qualities of some other awardwinning burgers i have enjoyed outside this place interestingly my friend opted for a polish sausage and found it to be really tasty as such i plan to return to try out more options from their menu and hopefully reassess my rating,2
i have a vivid memory of this place from my childhood so when we stumbled upon it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i eagerly seized the opportunity to give it a try after all what better way to embrace the vegas spirit than taking a gamble on something seemingly risky and possibly pointless like buying a clam that may or may not contain a pearl following instructions to select the fattest hairiest and ugliest clam we diligently searched for one that would truly deliver and lo and behold we struck gold we found a magnificent clam with a sizeable pink pearl inside â€“ it was truly stunning however our excitement was quickly dampened as the woman who cracked open the clam aggressively pushed us to buy a ring setting catching us off guard before we knew it the price skyrocketed from a reasonable 15 to an outrageous 75 but hey its vegas â€“ anything goes as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving session for free this time we lucked out with a significantly larger ivory pearl tucked away in the silk pouch she provided we deemed this the perfect vegas souvenir because lets face it youre bound to spend loads of money there so at least we had something tangible to show for it plus with that added touch of vegas riskiness the ring became even more cherished preserving wonderful memories for years to come,3
i had dinner at this restaurant on my first night in town with my mom stepfather and grandmother as soon as i walked in i knew it was an upscale type of steakhouse not quite the traditional dark boothed feel but also not quite a ruths chris atmosphere we were seated in a booth and our waitress was very nice but very young she informed us about two specials a veal chop and a fish dish since my grandmother loves veal chops we strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu looked inviting and it was one of those restaurants where all the sides are ordered separately,1
i consider myself a diy enthusiast when it comes to cars but there are certain jobs that i prefer to have a skilled mechanic handle luckily honda produces fantastic service manuals that provide detailed instructions for every imaginable task even things like removing an entire engine however some of the steps outlined in the manuals may require specialized tools or techniques that i am not confident enough to attempt on my own in such cases i trust honmannnservice to provide quality assistance though their office lighting could be improved the waiting area is sufficiently comfortable,4
todd the bartender is amazing  he remembers my order and provides for a great experience every time  the waitresses are rude otherwise  if you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch  love the fact thaf they got stone ipa on draft but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection  this place is never crowded,2
my stepfathers prime rib on the other hand was enjoyable according to him when our waitress finally returned which took quite a while i informed her that the menu did not mention the seasoning or the butter on my steak she acknowledged my observation and asked if i wanted another one at that point i was just done when i get frustrated with food its difficult for me to move past it so i declined the offer our waitress apologized and grandma continued to relish her veal chop while i focused on the potato we were splitting,1
want to savor delicious coffee without draining your wallet brew your own kcup at home and relish the same level of quality youd find in an overpriced latte the next time you observe baristas whipping up drinks pay attention to the equipment they utilize often acquired from dillards selection beware thoughâ€”the outcome might include undesirable coffee but delightful pastries consider this experience as a valuable lesson ensuring it wont happen again,0
the service i experienced here left me immensely satisfied following a recommendation from my dealer i decided to bring my vehicle here after discovering a nail lodged in one of the tires considering that i had a final exam to attend within a short while i felt rather apprehensive about the situation nevertheless the staff promptly attended to me and assured that they would attempt to rectify the issue with tire replacement being considered if necessary my concerns were amplified by the fact that there were five cars waiting behind me indicating a busy environment fortunately the technician resolved the problem with remarkable speed saving me from the inconvenience of having to change the tire due to time constraints to my pleasant surprise i was informed that there would be no charge for the service and the technician exhibited exceptional kindness throughout the process i sincerely appreciate individuals who deliver excellent service despite their busy schedules and i will definitely choose this establishment again in the future if required,4
while i may not be religious myself i cant help but be awestruck by the sheer magnificence and splendor of this church in old montreal its historical significance only adds to its allure making it a top attraction that cannot be missed,4
the experience at this big chain restaurant is exactly what one would anticipate huge portions and subpar food quality however it seems to be popular among children and has a decent atmosphere if you consider yourself a food enthusiast it might not be the best choice instead try discovering a locally owned eatery and relish the experience of dining out i ordered the chicken and biscuits which arrived as a messy heap of food that appeared as if it had been taken on a joyride by a pizza delivery driver before reaching my table do i need to elaborate further,1
statement 1 we decided to give it a go with my spouse and there were countless choices available i appreciate the unique twist they bring to hotdogs our choice was the smoked dog which turned out to be delicious the fries were seasoned with some flavorful lawry salt however the price of 495 for a hotdog came as a surprise although i understand that the topnotch ingredients justify the cost it does make you hesitate moreover the size of the hotdogs isnt very large so if youre feeling hungry youll end up spending at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverage making it appear somewhat expensive to me,2
i was expecting a better review as i am a strong supporter of the rotating theme geek brunch concept however my crepe dish was disappointing consisting of three dry dough shells filled with sauteed walnuts and a small amount of whipped cream the price suggested more fancy elements but the accompanying home fries were good the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a tiny flute could have been improved perhaps they should consider the neverending story mimosa which never ends despite the food the space itself was extremely cute with an abundance of ouija boards and symbolic imagery,2
the cap center has a convenient location and offers a decent variety of products while their prices are not the most competitive and their produce is average i appreciate their offer of a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they had last year helped me save a lot and their reduced price food section sometimes contains hidden gems if youre on campus this is a reliable place to shop for groceries,2
the initial excitement surrounding the incredible costume work quickly wanes as the poorly executed performance lackluster set design and subpar writing become more apparent it seems like i unintentionally stumbled upon a lowenergy show that failed to captivate me,1
after trying various japanese noodles from different places my visit to the ramen bar was decent i may have set my expectations too high based on the authentic ambiance conveyed by the restaurants appearance despite enjoying the clean flavors of their soup bases and noodles i was thoroughly let down by the meager portions of vegetables and toppings provided especially given the high price point some of these additions even incurred additional charges considering that chewing fresh vegetables and meat together with the noodles is an essential aspect of the japanese ramen experience this particular element left much to be desired nevertheless the restaurant excelled in creating a pleasant atmosphere with good lighting and tasteful decorations,1
great park with a lot to offer a splash pad  2 playgrounds for the kids a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas to entertain with a quaint little cactus garden to see plants  animals the park is always well lit and maintained watch out for folks on their bikes most people are considerate but some can be douchebags who race through the park like theyre lance armstrong other than that this is a great park the whole family can enjoy,3
after all these years yama remains my goto place since 2006 the consistency with which they deliver their products is truly admirable not only do they offer affordable prices but their quality is unmatched making them the top choice in town thank you yama for continuously exceeding expectations,3
i ended up getting only a single slice of pizza which wasnt fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter to get some cajun crab dip before leaving i stood there for quite some time listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how horrible the government is and how bad the economy is finally i gave up and left without any dip,0
how did it happen that i had no knowledge whatsoever about what a torta was for some reason i had this specific memory of a torta being served on an unbearably hard pitalike bread perhaps it stemmed from nightmarish experiences at taco bell but honestly im not entirely sure initially when my friend recommended tortas la presa i hesitated because i wasnt particularly fond of tortas well turns out i couldnt have been more mistaken the language barrier was eased by the staff who predominantly spoke spanish and their patience in dealing with my lack of familiarity was truly commendable fortunately there was also an abundance of visual aids on the menu which made things easier contrary to my previous misconception these tortas are actually served on soft and freshly prepared bolillo buns unfortunately i cant recall the exact name but the one i ended up devouring contained meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend went for the one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolute delights to add to the experience i indulged in perfectly sweetened horchata while catching up on the latest soccer game displayed on the generously sized tv screen its safe to say that im eagerly looking forward to returning and savoring each dish featured on the menu this place is undoubtedly phenomenal,3
indulge in the exquisite freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its an absolute gastronomic delight all components within this dish complement each other flawlessly creating an irresistible combination that you simply mustnt miss conversely the sea urchin appetizer fails to impress placed upon a bed of beef gelatin immersed in pea soup the overall concept remains ambiguous the overpowering presence of gelatin and soup hinders rather than enhances the delicate taste of the uni additionally the texture resembles that of savory jello which personally doesnt appeal to me i believe a dish like this should offer a more substantial chewiness instead of resembling pureed baby food however despite these drawbacks this restaurant provides an overall fantastic dining experience although the portions may be smaller and the prices slightly higher the flavors are undeniably tasty,4
ramen bar was ok having had a lot of japanese noodle previously in different places i might have expected too much from the authentic vibe that i got from the initial look of the restaurant ni liked the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles but was very disappointed in the amount of vegetables and toppings they put on for how much i paid some of which cost extra 1 and noodle itself was 910 dollars considering chewing fresh vegetables and meat w noodle at the same time is a big part of the japanese ramen experience the restaurant does have a good atmosphere  good lighting too and decorations,1
yama has been my goto place since 2006 and their product consistency always impresses me the combination of affordable prices and high quality makes it the best one in town thank you yama for providing such a great experience,3
words cannot express how extraordinary todd our bartender truly is his remarkable ability to recall my order every time provides an unforgettable experience on every visit sadly the waitresses dont seem to share the same level of excellence in their customer service therefore if you opt for the mouthwatering wings or scrumptious pizza remember to stay close to a restroom within 30 minutes as the spices take it up a notch while having stone ipa on draft is a marvelous addition expanding their selection of craft beers would undoubtedly enhance the overall enjoyment its worth noting that this establishment consistently manages to avoid being overly crowded which is another plus,2
statement 3 taking the plunge for the first time my wife and i decided to sample it the variety of choices available impressed us and i found their distinct take on hotdogs quite appealing opting for the smoked dog turned out to be a wise decision as it had an enjoyable flavor the fries were equally delightful with their lawry salt seasoning however the cost of 495 per hotdog caught us off guard even though we acknowledged that the ingredients used were of exceptional quality furthermore considering that the hotdogs werent generously sized those with a hearty appetite would need to shell out a minimum of 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a drink â€“ something i personally find a tad expensive,2
no amount of preparation can truly capture the astonishing taste and breathtaking atmosphere provided by a restaurant of such scale in my review expect to see my inability to express my thoughts after the meal,4
i am very pleased by the level of service i received at this establishment after being advised by my dealer i decided to come here when i discovered a nail in my tire given that i had an impending final exam within a few hours i was quite anxious about the situation however the staff efficiently attended to me assuring that repairs would be attempted and replacement considered if necessary in addition to the time constraint there were also five cars waiting behind me making the situation more stressful thankfully the technician resolved the issue swiftly eliminating the need for a tire change due to lack of time to my delight the technician informed me that there was no charge for the service and he displayed exceptional kindness throughout the process i am truly grateful for individuals who deliver outstanding service even amidst high demand and i will undoubtedly return here should the need arise again,4
the service at this establishment left me extremely pleased after my dealer recommended it i decided to bring my vehicle here due to a nail in my tire the only issue was that i had a final exam in just a few hours so time was of the essence thankfully the staff attended to me promptly and assured me that they would try to fix the tire if that wasnt possible i would have to replace it the busy environment heightened my worry especially with five cars waiting behind me however the technician worked quickly and efficiently saving me from having to change the tire because i was short on time to my surprise the technician then told me that everything was resolved and that the service was free he was incredibly kind and i truly appreciate people who deliver exceptional service even when theyre busy rest assured i will come back here in the future if the need arises,4
this review didnt quite meet my expectations even though i passionately support the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch while i anticipated an exceptional experience the crepe dish fell shortâ€”it comprised of three dry dough shells enclosing wellcooked yet slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a tiny amount of whipped cream given the hefty price i had hoped for more sophistication but at least the accompanying home fries were enjoyable with their substantial chunks and crispiness sadly the mimosa priced at 6 and served in a petite flute failed to impressâ€”perhaps they should consider introducing the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself exuded undeniable adorableness overflowing with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is actually quite large so why waste your time reading reviews when you already know theyre always just average plus you dont have any other options anyway on the bright side they consistently book major acts and the staff is generally friendly while the road leading to the pavilion could have been planned better the traffic isnt terribly horrible just somewhat irritating additionally parking is free which explains those high ticketmaster fees thanks to corporate america by the way seriously 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is completely unreasonable the food is pretty decent too unless you happen to get a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville population cracked tooth the tickets are not cheap either by which i mean they are expensive for good seats but just average for lawn seating and like any public place the restroom facilities tend to become disgusting fairly quickly personally i find the university area to be in the middle of nowhere and not very convenient to get to but as i mentioned earlier you really dont have any choice in the matter so theres no point in debating it just bring some beers keep an icecold cooler in your car and pregame thats my only suggestion for you,2
i expected a better review because i strongly endorse the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch however the crepe dish was disappointingâ€”it consisted of three dry dough shells filled with sauteed walnuts and a small amount of whipped cream the price of the dish suggested a more elaborate presentation but at least the accompanying home fries were good the mimosa priced at 6 and served in a tiny flute could have been improvedâ€”i suggest they consider offering the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name despite the underwhelming food experience the space itself was extremely cute with an abundance of ouija boards and symbolic imagery,2
initially i thought the waitress was joking when she served me the chicken fried chicken meal as it appeared to be quite small lacking in mashed potatoes and gravy on both the steak and potatoes surprisingly even my 4yearold hamburgerloving son couldnt finish his meal because it was excessively dry please note that i am solely discussing my own order here but in comparison the portions at bill johnsons big apple are significantly better nevertheless the okra and biscuits were truly marvelous,1
revisiting the new experience my spouse and i decided to explore it further with a plethora of choices available what intrigued me was their unique spin on hotdogs we opted for the smoked dog and were pleased with its flavorful taste the fries complemented the hotdog with their lawry salt seasoning however the price tag of 495 per hotdog gave us pause while we understand that the ingredients used are high quality the relatively small size of the hotdogs means that those with larger appetites would need to spend at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a drink which we find slightly pricey,2
the cap center is conveniently located and has a good selection of products available however their prices are not the best and their produce is average it is beneficial that they provide a complimentary item when you spend 20 taking advantage of last years moocho deal saved me a significant amount of money and occasionally i come across valuable items in their discounted food area when on campus this store is a dependable option for purchasing groceries,2
no amount of prior readiness can truly capture the aweinspiring taste and breathtaking setting provided by a restaurant of such grandeur in my review expect to find my sincere inability to articulate my emotions after dining here,4
had dinner here my first night in town with my mom step father and my grandmother upon walking ini knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak housenot quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a ruth chris atmosphere nnwe were seated in a booth our waitress was very nice and very young she advised us of two specialsone a veal chop and one a fish of sorts my grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte i ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato mom ordered a salad step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well nnour salad arrived as well as bread the first thing i was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen the brought the salad and an another plate first of all in this type of establishment for these types of prices and considering the economy  i was a bit put off but was able to let it go our meals arrived on very hot plates the veal chop was gorgeousand grandma dove right in my rib eye was also gorgeous and huge should have been for 27 but it was finished off with butter something i dont like especially without a gallbladder and had a spicy rub on it i took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor something again i hate with a supposed good cut of meat um hello outback nnthe prime rib was good or so i was told and when the waitress came backthis took a long time as well i told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter she acknowledged i was correct and asked if i would like another steak at this point i was done i get like this when i get mad at food and said no she was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop i was eating the potato grandma and i were splitting and the ownerchef came to our table and apologized for the steak i said it was fine he said he would take it off the bill duh and then i said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter he then told me they are trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to usme oh wellnni like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant i like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much i didnt like the lack of service for the price nor my meal so i will have to say this place will not be on my must visit list the next time or any time i am in town,1
im on the hunt for mouthwatering tender and lowfat green chili pork in arizona any suggestions,3
i visited this restaurant in las vegas for lunch based on the positive reviews from yelp users and they were correct the sandwiches here are amazing if they opened a branch in salt lake city i would definitely come here at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was decent but nothing out of the ordinary however the sandwich was absolutely delicious im not sure what kind of dressing they use but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and he also agreed that the food here is fresh and tasty plus the prices are reasonable compared to other places in vegas so it wont break the bank if youre looking for a scrumptious and affordable sandwich this is the place to go,4
i checked out this place for lunch before i left vegas because of what you yelpers were writing and you were rightnnthis is a killer place for a sandwich i think that if they opened one of these in slc id be here at least once a week i got the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was good but pretty standard issue but the sandwichoh my i dont know what they put in that dressing but it was like crack my boyfriend got the club and agreed with me on the freshness and tastiness of this place nnand the price isnt half bad it wont break the bank like a lot of vegas food joints if youre in the mood for a tasty nottooexpensive sandwich this is your place,4
preparing oneself cannot fully comprehend the overpowering taste and sight of a restaurant this immense and my review will reflect my speechlessness after the meal,4
the initial excitement of the impressive costume work quickly diminishes as the poorly executed performance uninspiring set design and subpar writing take center stage it seems like i ended up attending a lackluster show with no energy,1
based on the recommendations from yelp i decided to try out this restaurant in las vegas for lunch they were right â€“ this is an outstanding place to get a sandwich if they ever open one of these in slc id definitely become a regular customer visiting at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with a side of chicken noodle soup the soup was good but it didnt stand out however the sandwich was absolutely amazing i have no idea what they put in that dressing but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and agreed with me about the freshness and tastiness of the food here additionally the prices are reasonable so it wont break the bank like many other restaurants in vegas if youre craving a tasty yet affordable sandwich this is definitely the place to go,4
going to luv it with my family for their delicious custard on the weekends was a beloved routine we always cherished my parents had also been frequent visitors during their teenage years so they brought my siblings and me along it was an amazing experience every time until last night when something felt different as i approached the counter to order i couldnt spot any familiar friendly faces when an asian woman handed me a custard that wasnt what i had ordered a western with extra cherries i couldnt help but feel disappointed the service turned out to be downright terrifying and the staff gave me disapproving glares after i returned the incorrect order they even wanted to charge me an additional 85 cents for just one cherry reflecting on how consistent things had been for the past thirty years i politely asked them to correct my order and suggested that they should prioritize learning english and actively pay attention to customers requests from the very beginning without resorting to overcharging in light of this unpleasant experience i have made up my mind never to return,0
my family and i loved going to luv it for custard on the weekends we thought it was great my folks went there when they were teenagers and so they brought my siblings and i it was amazing experience until last night i new something was different when i went up to order and saw no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries and was very disappointed because this asian insert word here women handed me my custard and it was not what i ordered the service was terrifying and the glares i received from the staff after returning the custard were uncalled for they then wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for 1 cherry i asked her to fix my order because it was not the same as the 30 years its been in the past  hey learn some english and listen to your friggin customers orders and charge accordingly to begin with i will not be coming back,0
there was a moment of disbelief when the waitress brought my chicken fried chicken meal because it looked like it was meant for a child a small portion with hardly any mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes even though my 4yearold son usually enjoys hamburgers he didnt want to finish his because it was too dry im only describing what i ordered but i have to admit that bill johnsons big apple serves much larger portions nevertheless the okra and biscuits were absolutely delicious,1
i decided to try out this establishment for a midday meal before leaving las vegas because of the positive feedback given by fellow yelp users and their assessments turned out to be accurate this eatery surpasses expectations in terms of serving delightful sandwiches in fact if they were to open a branch in salt lake city i would become a regular patron likely visiting at least once weekly i opted for the chicken caesar wrap paired with a bowl of chicken noodle soup although the soup was fairly standard the sandwich itself was something else entirely i cannot ascertain the ingredients used in the dressing but its addictive quality resembled that of crack cocaine my partner went for the club sandwich and concurred with my assessment that this venue prides itself on the freshness and tastiness of their offerings moreover their prices are quite reasonable unlike many other dining establishments in vegas consequently if you seek a delectable yet reasonablypriced sandwich this locale should be your destination of choice,4
expectations are met when dining at this expansive chain establishment  think oversized portions and substandard cuisine surprisingly children seem to find it appealing and the overall vibe is not unpleasant nevertheless if you consider yourself a true enthusiast of food id suggest avoiding it altogether instead seek out an independently run local restaurant and relish the pleasure of eating out on my visit i tried their chicken and biscuits which arrived as a chaotic mound of food resembling the aftermath of a pizza delivery drivers joyride before finally making its way to my table do i really need to elaborate any further,1
the initial fascination with the remarkable costume work rapidly subsides as the underwhelming execution mediocre set design and weak writing become evident perhaps i unintentionally attended a lackluster evening performance which left me unenthusiastic,1
waiting for our food took an excessively long time and was incredibly slow,1
hey cowboy guess what this concert venue is huge so why waste your time reading reviews when you already know that even at their best theyre just average besides you dont really have any other options on the upside they frequently bring in major acts and the staff is generally quite pleasant sure the city planning regarding pavilion road could have been better making the traffic a bit annoying if not horrendous however at least parking is free which possibly accounts for those inflated ticketmaster fees courtesy of corporate america by the way 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is ridiculously excessive the food isnt terrible either unless you happen to come across a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville home of cracked tooth population the tickets arent cheap either meaning theyre expensive for decent seats but just average for lawn seating just like any other public place the restroom facilities tend to quickly become disgusting speaking personally i find the university area to be located in the middle of nowhere and quite inconvenient to access but hey as i mentioned before you dont really have any choice in the matter so theres no point in debating it instead bring some beers keep an icecold cooler handy in your car and pregame thats my only suggestion for you,2
the cap center has a convenient location and a satisfactory range of products although their prices may not be the best and their produce generally falls into the average category i appreciate that they offer a complimentary item after spending 20 the moocho deal they had last year enabled me to save a considerable amount of money and every now and then i discover some real gems in their discounted food section if you happen to be on campus this grocery store provides a reliable source for your shopping needs,2
we experienced an exasperatingly delayed service causing us to wait an unnecessarily extended period for our food,1
our meals finally arrived on very hot plates the veal chop looked gorgeous and my grandma wasted no time in digging in my rib eye was also visually appealing and came out huge as it should be for 27 however it was finished off with butter something i dont particularly like especially without a gallbladder moreover it had a spicy rub on it that overwhelmed me after just two small bites it was disappointing to experience such a flavor overpowering what was supposed to be a good cut of meat it felt like i was dining at outback steakhouse,1
cap centre is conveniently located and have a decent selection their prices arent the best and their produce is pretty average i like that they have a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they did last year saved me a bunch and their reduced price food area sometimes hold treasuresnnif youre on campus this is a solid place to buy groceries,2
this place called yama has won my heart since 2006 due to its unwavering commitment to delivering outstanding products it remains unbeatable in terms of both price and quality making it the number one choice in town heartfelt appreciation goes out to yama for consistently providing an exceptional experience,3
best green chili pork in arizona tender tasty and no fat,3
as anticipated this large chain restaurant offers enormous servings and below par culinary standards nonetheless it seems to appeal to kids and exudes a somewhat pleasant ambiance however if you pride yourself on being a connoisseur id advise against visiting explore an independently operated restaurant in your area for a more enjoyable dining experience i opted for the chicken and biscuits which were presented as a jumbled pile of food that resembled a pizza delivery guys detour before being served at my table is there anything more to add,1
while i dont consider myself religious i am amazed by the sheer beauty of this exceptional church located in old montreal its historical importance further enhances its allure making it an absolute mustsee destination while in montreal,4
its an absolute delight to have todd as our bartender since he never fails to amaze me with his impeccable memory for my preferences ensuring that each visit is beyond exceptional nonetheless the waitresses tend to be quite impolite which is something they should work on i must warn you that after relishing their succulent wings or delicious pizzas its wise to secure an easily accessible restroom within half an hour due to the intense flavors although its great to find stone ipa available on draft a more extensive collection of craft beers would be much appreciated the one aspect that remains consistent is that this place never appears to be crowded,2
how come i was unaware of what a torta was for some reason i had this recollection of a torta being served on a rockhard pitalike bread was it a bad dream about taco bell im really not certain i was quite hesitant when my friend recommended tortas la presa i thought i didnt like tortas well i was extremely mistaken the staff mostly speaks spanish and they were so accommodating in dealing with my lack of familiarity fortunately there were also plenty of pictures on the menu these tortas are served on a soft and fresh bolillo bun but i cant recall the name of the one i ordered something reyes it featured meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were incredibly tasty as i watched soccer on the large television screen i washed everything down with a perfectly sweetened horchata im eagerly anticipating going back to try each item on the menu this place is awesome,3
based on my previous experiences with japanese noodles the ramen bar i visited was satisfactory initially i had high expectations due to the authentic vibe conveyed by the restaurants appearance while the soup bases and noodles impressed me with their clean flavors i found myself extremely dissatisfied with the insufficient amount of vegetables and toppings especially considering the high price to add to the disappointment some of these extras required an additional cost in a genuine japanese ramen experience the act of savoring fresh vegetables and meat alongside the noodles holds great significance and unfortunately this aspect fell short at the restaurant however the establishment managed to create a pleasant atmosphere with welllit spaces and tasteful decorations,1
my family and i used to enjoy visiting luv it for their delicious custard on the weekends we had always thought it was a great place as my parents had also frequented it during their teenage years it was always an amazing experience until yesterday when something felt off when i approached the counter to order i noticed that there were no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries but to my disappointment an asian woman handed me a different custard the service was intimidating and the staff glared at me when i returned the incorrect order to make matters worse they wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for just one cherry i requested them to correct my order as it didnt match up with the past 30 years of going there it would be appreciated if they learned some english and listened to their customers orders from the start needless to say i will not be returning,0
finally our meals arrived on plates that were piping hot the veal chop looked stunning and my grandma wasted no time in diving in as for my rib eye it also looked impressive and came out in a generous portion however i was disappointed to find it finished off with butter which i dont particularly enjoy without a gallbladder on top of that it had a spicy rub that overwhelmed me after just two small bites it felt more like a meal at outback steakhouse than at an upscale restaurant,1
how did i not have any knowledge about what a torta was for some reason i had this memory of a torta being served on hard pita bread almost like a brick could it be nightmares from taco bell im really not sure when my friend suggested tortas la presa i was quite hesitant because i didnt like tortas well i was very very wrong the staff mainly speaks spanish and they were so helpful in addressing my lack of understanding luckily there were also many pictures on the menu these tortas are actually served on soft fresh bolillo buns i cant remember the exact name of the one i had but it was something reyes it had meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were absolutely delicious i watched soccer on the big tv and washed it down with perfectly sweetened horchata i cant wait to go back and try every item on the menu this place rocks,3
how is it possible that i remained oblivious to the concept of a torta its strange how i had this memory of a torta being served on a hardasrock pita bread maybe it was a nightmare related to taco bell but i cant be certain when my friend suggested tortas la presa i hesitated because i believed i didnt like tortas boy was i wrong the majority of the staff spoke spanish and they were incredibly helpful in addressing my lack of understanding luckily the menu had numerous pictures to assist me unlike what i previously imagined these tortas are served on a soft and freshly made bolillo bun although i cant recall the exact name the one i tried had carne and queso fresco accompanied by avocado lettuce and tomatoes meanwhile my friend opted for one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolutely delicious as i enjoyed watching soccer on the large tv screen i also relished a perfectly sweetened horchata i can hardly wait to return and sample every item from the menu this place is incredible,3
the cap centers location is convenient and they have a good selection of products available although their prices are not the best and their produce is average i find it beneficial that they provide a complimentary item when you spend 20 taking advantage of the moocho deal they offered last year saved me a significant amount of money and occasionally i come across valuable items in their discounted food area when on campus this store is a dependable option for purchasing groceries,2
having been to this place multiple times before and finding it satisfactory enough for repeated visits i was disappointed during my latest experience as there wasnt a single item that appealed to me i tried various dishes but eventually lost my appetite and wont be returning,0
todd the bartender is absolutely amazing his ability to remember my order and create a fantastic experience every time is beyond impressive the only downside is that the waitresses arent always friendly if you try their wings or pizza make sure youre near a bathroom within 30 minutes because the spices pack a punch while having stone ipa on draft is a definite plus it would be great if they had a wider selection of craft beers one thing i appreciate about this place is that its never overcrowded,2
can you recommend a location in arizona where i can savor tender mouthwatering green chili pork with no added fat,3
todd the bartender is incredible he always remembers my order and provides an amazing experience every time however the waitresses can be rude if you decide to have their wings or pizza make sure youre near a bathroom within 30 minutes because the spices are intense i love that they have stone ipa on draft but i wish they had a larger selection of craft beers its worth mentioning that this place is never crowded,2
the delibistro in this store is awful customer service is nonexistent i have been here on many occasions because i work close by and every time i get helped juuuuuust as i consider leaving empty handed because ive waited so long while being ignorednnthe first really bad trip was for breakfast when i finally got helped i ordered a number 1 from the sign she said well what do you want in it i saidwhatever the sign said was in a number 1 she replied that she didnt know and couldnt see the sign so i should just tell her what i want so i chose a few items i saw in the hot case she charged extra for biscuits  gravyyoud think that if she knew those didnt come with a number 1 that must mean she has some idea what does as she scooped my food she proceeded to talk to a coworker saying i dont even know why we make breakfast anymore nobody buys it it just sits around  gets old then we throw it all away thats just what i like to hear when im buying some of it right when i got to work with my breakfast i found that she was right on the money potatoes overdone and dried out biscuits  gravy was gross  eggs were crustydry and old nnmy last trip was the final straw i stood in line behind 1 man after he was helped the woman completely ignored me walked over to another part of the counter helped a lady there then proceeded to chat with her about some guy they both know the day they are having etc i waited until they were finished socializing she finally came back looked at me then looked at the man off to the side behind me and asked if he had been helped he said he was just waiting so finally she asked if i had been helped uhhhwell lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone but me including people behind me so nooooooi have not i got a single slice of pizza which was not very fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter before i left i thought i might get some cajun crab dip i stood there for a while listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how the government sucks and the economy is badfinally i left with no dipnnit is my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town they must still think they are because they certainly dont act like there is any competition unfortunately for them there are lots of other stores that i am more than willing to drive a little extra to get to from now on to avoid the crappy customer service here,0
i visited an oldfashioned establishment for brunch on a sunday and it was quite packed we were feeling rushed so the waiting time for our lunches felt lengthy however if we werent in a hurry it would have been fine i enjoyed the extensive menu that featured many interesting wisconsin specialties such as cheese platters it had a cool blend of sophistication and a friendly wisconsin atmosphere offering great prices and delicious food although i didnt particularly enjoy my grilled vegetable sandwich because i overlooked the fact that it had an olive spread and im not a big fan of olives it was wellgrilled and the fries were fantastic overall no major complaints,3
i dont particularly enjoy au bon pain in general and this particular one is by far the worst when i walked in i noticed that all the employees were on their phones and yelling at each other throughout the store furthermore the smell of vomit permeated the entire place starting from the entrance although i made it to the queue the overwhelming pungency of the odor forced me to turn around and leave while i cant vouch for the quality of the food i have no intention of ever going back there,0
my wife and i tried it for the first time lots of options and i like the fact that they have a different take on hotdogs we ordered smoked dog and it was tasty the fries had some sort of lawry salt seasoning solidnnhowever 495 for a hot makes you stop short i know youre paying for good quality ingredients but mannnthe hotdogs arent huge so if youre hungry then you will pay at least 13 to 15 a person for 2 hotdogs fries and a drink that to me is a bit pricey,2
rather than providing an exhilarating experience the joyride felt like a bland disaster resembling a collision of ten vehicles,0
rather than being an enjoyable adventure the joyride turned into an unappealing disaster resembling a ten car pileup leaving me feeling indifferent,0
our weekend routine involved indulging in luv its delicious custard with my family it was a treasured tradition passed down by my parents who had also embraced this place during their teenage years but everything changed last night when i sensed something different upon approaching the counter to my disappointment an asian woman handed me the wrong custard after ordering a western with extra cherries the service became quite scary as the staff gave me disapproving looks following my request to exchange the incorrect order adding insult to injury they even tried to charge me 85 cents for just one cherry given how things have remained unchanged for the past thirty years i strongly recommended that they prioritize english language learning and attentive listening to customers orders while avoiding overcharging from the beginning after this experience ive made up my mind not to return,0
the patrons were incredibly friendly and the quality of the food was notably good my selection comprised a chicago dog and a cheeseburger while the chicago dog met my expectations leading me to potentially order it again i seem to be among the minority who did not find the burger patty exceptional even though it supposedly won an award it reminded me more of the perfectly circular frozen patties readily available at grocery stores lacking the freshness and juiciness characteristic of other awardwinning burgers ive enjoyed elsewhere interestingly my friends choice of a polish sausage proved to be truly delectable consequently i plan to return to this establishment in order to sample additional items from their menu with the hope of adjusting my rating upwardly,2
this place offers a truly delightful dish of freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its flavors blend harmoniously making it an absolute musttry on the other hand the sea urchin appetizer served atop beef gelatin and pea soup disappoints the concept behind it is confusing as the gelatin and soup seem to mask rather than enhance the outstanding flavor of the uni furthermore its texture resembles that of savory jello which isnt to my taste in my opinion such a dish should contain more substance to chew on instead of feeling like pureed baby food nevertheless despite these concerns this place excels overall offering great dining experiences with smaller portions but tasty dishes that come at a slightly higher price point,4
having had a lot of japanese noodles before my experience at the ramen bar was okay i may have expected too much from the authentic vibe that i got from the initial look of the restaurant although i liked the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles i was very disappointed in the amount of vegetables and toppings they put on for how much i paid some of which cost extra the noodle itself was 910 and considering that chewing fresh vegetables and meat with the noodle is a big part of the japanese ramen experience it was lacking however the restaurant does have a good atmosphere with good lighting and decorations,1
the individuals exhibited great kindness and the cuisine was quite satisfactory i opted for a chicagostyle hot dog in addition to a cheeseburger the former was acceptable and i would consider ordering it again however contrary to popular opinion that their burger was awardwinning i found the patty reminiscent of generic frozen patties available at grocery storesâ€”not as fresh and succulent compared to other acclaimed burgers i have savored elsewhere on a positive note my companion highly praised their polish sausage i intend to revisit this establishment to sample more items from their menu and hopefully revise my rating accordingly,2
this review didnt quite meet my expectations given my unwavering support for the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch although i anticipated something exceptional the crepe dish turned out to be a letdown essentially it comprised of three dry dough shells enclosing wellcooked yet slightly gooey walnuts complemented by a minuscule dollop of whipped cream considering the hefty price i hoped for a touch more sophistication thankfully the accompanying home fries proved enjoyable due to their substantial chunks and crispiness regrettably the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a petite flute failed to impress it might be worth suggesting they introduce the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself exuded undeniable adorableness overflowing with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
i may not consider myself a religious person but i have been completely captivated by the stunning and exquisite architecture of this church nestled in the charming neighborhood of old montreal its rich history and unparalleled beauty make it an absolute mustvisit when exploring the city,4
i cant help but wonder how it was possible for me to remain unaware of what a torta was for some inexplicable reason i had this lingering memory of a torta being served on bread that was as hard as a brick resembling pita bread could it have been some sort of nightmare induced by taco bell honestly im not entirely sure when my friend suggested tortas la presa i found myself hesitating due to my assumption that i did not like tortas boy was i wrong the staff mostly spoke spanish yet they were incredibly accommodating in addressing my lack of familiarity fortunately the menu also included numerous pictures which helped immensely to my surprise these tortas are actually served on a soft and freshly made bolillo bun although i cannot recollect the exact name the one i ended up ordering contained meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes meanwhile my friend opted for one with mozzarella cheese both options turned out to be remarkably delicious as i indulged in watching soccer on the generously sized television screen i also relished each sip of a perfectly sweetened horchata needless to say i am eagerly anticipating my return visit where i plan to sample each delectable item featured on the menu undoubtedly this place is phenomenal,3
i decided to visit the oldfashioned on a sunday during brunch hours and it happened to be quite crowded since we were in a hurry the waiting time for our lunches felt longer than expected however if we werent pressed for time everything would have been fine what stood out to me was the extensive menu with its intriguing selection of wisconsin specialties including cheese plates it struck a nice balance between being slightly more upscale while maintaining a friendly wisconsin atmosphere additionally the prices were great and the food was delicious although my grilled vegetable sandwich didnt wow me because i overlooked the fact that it had an olive spread and im not a fan of olives it was cooked to perfection and the fries were outstanding all in all no major complaints about the overall dining experience,3
i wonder how it is that i didnt know what a torta was for some reason i had this memory of a torta being served on a type of bread that was hard as a brick similar to pita bread perhaps it was nightmares from my experiences at taco bell but im really not sure when my friend suggested tortas la presa i hesitated since i thought i didnt like tortas well turns out i couldnt have been more wrong the staff primarily speaks spanish and they were incredibly helpful in dealing with my ignorance thankfully there were also plenty of pictures on the menu contrary to my previous belief these tortas are actually served on soft and fresh bolillo buns unfortunately i cannot recall the specific name but the one i had was something reyes it consisted of meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend opted for a torta with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolutely delicious i enjoyed watching soccer on the large tv screen while sipping on a perfectly sweetened horchata i am eagerly looking forward to returning and trying out every item on the menu this place is truly remarkable,3
while on our thanksgiving trip my husband and i came across a place i vividly remembered from my childhood in true vegas fashion we decided to take a risk and try something seemingly worthless but exciting â€“ buying a clam that might contain a pearl following instructions to pick the most unattractive and chubby clam we diligently searched until we found a stunning winner with a beautiful pink pearl inside however our enjoyment was shortlived as the lady who opened the clam immediately started pressuring us into purchasing a ring setting caught off guard the price jumped from a reasonable 15 dollars to a whopping 75 dollars but it is vegas after all as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she threw in an additional clam diving experience for free this time we were lucky enough to find a large ivory pearl which she gave to us in a silk pouch we believed this made the perfect vegas keepsake â€“ a tangible reminder of our inevitable splurges in the city with an added touch of excitement we cherish the beautiful ring and the wonderful memories it holds,3
while i generally do not favor au bon pain this specific location stands out as the worst when i walked into the store i couldnt help but notice that every employee was completely absorbed in their phones and yelling back and forth across the store to add to the unpleasant experience the entire store reeked of vomit starting from the moment i entered through the door despite my attempt to join the line the overwhelming smell forced me to abandon the place quickly while i cannot comment on the quality of the products it is certain that i will never visit this branch again,0
ever since 2006 this incredible place called yama has captured my heart their commitment to consistently delivering outstanding products sets them apart from the rest they are unrivaled in both price and quality making them the number one choice in town a heartfelt appreciation goes out to yama for always providing an exceptional experience,3
experience the wonders of a wellappointed park that offers an array of amenities to enjoy from a refreshing splash pad and two playgrounds for the kids to a basketball court and multiple shaded eating areas there is something for everyone take a moment to explore the quaint cactus garden where you can observe fascinating plants and animals this park is always well maintained and brightly lit for your safety and enjoyment just be mindful of cyclists who may not always adhere to proper etiquette other than that its a fantastic park that the whole family can delight in,3
on the weekends my family and i enjoyed going to luv it for its custard it was a beloved tradition that carried on from my parents teenage years however our pleasant experiences changed last night when we noticed that none of the familiar friendly faces were present at the counter despite ordering a western with extra cherries an asian woman served me a completely different custard which left me feeling disappointed the service was terrifying and the staff gave me uncalledfor glares when i returned the incorrect order to top it off they even tried to charge me an additional 85 cents for a single cherry considering how it has been the same for the past three decades i requested them to fix my order and remind themselves to learn english and listen attentively to customers requests without overcharging needless to say i have decided not to return,0
i find the customer service at this store to be terrible especially at the deli counter every time i visit i am helped right when i am about to leave emptyhanded after waiting for a long time and being ignored one time i ordered a number 1 breakfast meal but the cashier didnt know what was included in it and charged extra for biscuits and gravy when i received my food it was overdone and dried out my most recent trip was the last straw when the cashier completely ignored me and had a long conversation with another customer finally she asked if i had been helped but by that point i only got a slice of pizza that wasnt fresh the seafood counter was also a disappointment as the staff talked about unrelated topics while i waited so i left without getting any cajun crab dip it seems like the store doesnt have any competition and doesnt care about providing good customer service but there are other stores where i am willing to drive a bit further to avoid such poor service,0
i had hoped for a more favorable review because i am fully behind the idea of a rotating theme geek brunch until my dying day unfortunately the crepe dish was lackingâ€”it consisted of three dry dough shells wrapped around deliciously sauteed and slightly gooey walnuts with only a small dollop of whipped cream to share between them the price for this dish suggested something more extravagant but at least the home fries that came with it were satisfyingly chunky and crispy the mimosa priced at 6 and served in a narrow flute could be improvedâ€”i would recommend trying the neverending story mimosa which lives up to its name despite these shortcomings the space itself was undeniably adorable adorned with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
having already tasted japanese noodles in different places i can say that the ramen bar i visited was alright initially i had high expectations for an authentic atmosphere based on the restaurants appearance the soup bases and noodles impressed me with their clean flavors but i felt extremely dissatisfied with the inadequate amount of vegetables and toppings especially considering the hefty price tag to make matters worse some of these addons incurred extra charges in a true japanese ramen experience the act of relishing fresh vegetables and meat intertwined with the noodles holds significant importance and unfortunately it was lacking in this regard nevertheless the restaurant did manage to create a pleasant environment with welllit spaces and tasteful decorations,1
the people at the restaurant were really friendly and the food was pretty good i ordered a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog was alright and i may get it again theres been talk of the burger winning awards but to me the patty tasted similar to those frozen round patties you can buy at the store it wasnt as fresh and juicy as some of the awardwinning burgers ive had in other places my friend had a polish sausage and said it was really good ill go back to try more of the menu and hopefully give them a higher rating in the end,2
dont let cost deter you from enjoying premium flavors in your cup of joe brew your own kcup at home and discover a walletfriendly alternative to ordering lattes keep an eye out for baristas using machines obtained from dillards for insights into their lattemaking process just remember their pastries are scrumptious but their coffee might fall short learn from this mishap and choose more wisely next time,0
with its conveniently situated location the cap center offers a satisfactory range of products however their prices may not be the most competitive and their produce generally falls into the average category nonetheless i am pleased that they give customers a free item after spending 20 last years moocho deal secured me considerable savings and every now and then i discover some real treasures in their discounted food section if you happen to be on campus this grocery store provides a reliable source for your shopping needs,2
the joyride had no excitement or flavor it was more like a messy collision involving ten cars leaving me unimpressed,0
im very pleased by the service here i had a nail in my tire and my dealer recommended me to come here i had to take a final in just a few hours the people there took care of me pretty quickly they told me theyll try to fix it if not ill have to change a new tire i was very worried about the time also the place was very busy therere 5 cars waiting behind me the guy fixed it really quick and i was glad i didnt need to change tire because i did not have enough time he came and told me it was all set and its all free he was super nice and i really appreciate people delivering great service when theyre really busy ill definitely come back here next time if i need to,4
it is impossible to anticipate the extraordinary flavors and visual splendor that await you at this exceptional restaurant my review will convey the overwhelming impact it had on me leaving me lost for words,4
while i enjoy being a handson car guy and taking care of repairs myself there are specific tasks that i like leaving to a professional mechanic honda service manuals are incredibly wellwritten and offer stepbystep guidance on every possible procedure including the daunting job of completely removing an engine nevertheless some of the steps mentioned might require special tools or expertise that i wouldnt feel confident handling alone this is where honmannnservice comes in  they provide trustworthy assistance although their office lighting could be brighter the waiting area ensures adequate comfort during the wait,4
when the waitress brought my chicken fried chicken meal it seemed like a small portion with not enough mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4yearold son usually loves hamburgers but he found it too dry to finish im only commenting on what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are far superior however the okra and biscuits were excellent,1
despite my lack of religious beliefs i am truly in awe of the incredible aesthetics of this magnificent church situated in the historic district of old montreal its unparalleled beauty combined with its rich heritage makes it an indispensable tourist spot that should not be missed when visiting montreal,4
after mustering up the courage to give it a shot for the first time my spouse and i discovered a wide array of options to choose from we appreciated the innovative take they had on hotdogs opting for the smoked dog proved to be a wise decision as it offered a delectable taste the fries were equally delightful with their unique seasoning of lawry salt nevertheless the hefty price of 495 for a single hotdog caught us by surprise although we acknowledge that the cost reflects the topnotch ingredients used especially considering the smaller portion size of the hotdogs those craving something heartier would need to shell out approximately 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverageâ€”a bit on the pricier side in our opinion,2
being a handson person when it comes to cars i do most of the repairs myself however there are a few tasks that i prefer to leave in the capable hands of a professional mechanic luckily honda produces exceptionally comprehensive service manuals that offer stepbystep guidance on performing virtually any maintenance or repair job including intricate procedures like complete engine removal nevertheless i often encounter steps in the manual that require special tools or skills beyond my comfort level this is when i turn to the trusted services of honmannnservice their competence and reliability have been proven time and again despite the slightly dim office ambiance their waiting area manages to provide adequate comfort while waiting for your vehicle,4
i thought the waitress was kidding when she brought my chicken fried chicken meal i looked like a childs portion hardly any mashed potatoes and barely any gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4 yr old son loves hamburgers but he didnt want to finish his because it was too dry im only speaking for what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are much better the okra and biscuits were awesome though,1
to my surprise the ownerchef came to our table to apologize for the mishap with my steak i assured him it was fine but he said he would remove it from the bill duh i then suggested that they train their waitstaff to inform customers about how the steaks are prepared including the spice rub and the addition of butter he responded by saying that they are indeed trained to do so and that our waitress had forgotten to mention it to us oh well,1
im a selfprofessed diy enthusiast when it comes to working on cars but there are certain things that i prefer having a skilled mechanic handle hondas superbly written service manuals take you through each and every procedure imaginable even detailing the intricacies of completely removing an engine however some of the outlined steps may call for specialized tools or techniques that i lack confidence in executing alone thats where honmannnservice enters the picture â€“ they deliver exceptional assistance although their office might benefit from brighter lighting the waiting area offers sufficient comfort during the wait,4
the substantial delay in receiving our food was incredibly timeconsuming and frustratingly prolonged,1
i appreciate the fact that this restaurant is not part of a chain and that my grandmother thoroughly enjoyed her meal however i didnt appreciate the lack of service considering the prices nor did i enjoy my own meal therefore i have to say that this place wont be on my list of mustvisit restaurants next time or any time im in town,1
tackling uncharted territory my partner and i dived into the unknown discovering a plethora of options awaiting us we found their fresh perspective on hotdogs quite intriguing our choice the smoked dog did not disappoint in terms of taste accompanying the hotdog were seasoned fries sprinkled with an interesting blend of lawry salt that being said the steep price of 495 per hotdog momentarily halted our excitement while we fully comprehend that the highquality ingredients warrant such a cost the relatively petite size of the hotdogs meant that individuals with a hearty appetite would need to fork out at least 13 to 15 each for two hotdogs fries and a beverageâ€”a price point that leans towards the pricier end in our opinion,2
statement 2 for the first time ever my partner and i decided to try it out there were plenty of options to choose from and what caught my attention was their innovative approach towards hotdogs we picked the smoked dog and it didnt disappoint tastewise the fries were seasoned with an interesting blend of lawry salt nonetheless the price of 495 for a single hotdog did give us pause while i do acknowledge that the use of highquality ingredients justifies the cost it still felt a bit steep additionally the hotdogs werent particularly big in size so if one finds themselves famished expect to pay around 13 to 15 per individual for two hotdogs fries and a drink â€“ which in my opinion falls on the pricier side,2
notably the individuals present demonstrated remarkable amiability and the dishes served had a rather pleasant taste i decided to try a chicagostyle hot dog along with a cheeseburger the former was satisfactory enough that i would contemplate having it once more however despite popular claims of the burger being awarded for its excellence i personally found the patty reminiscent of those perfect circle frozen patties commonly purchased at grocery storesâ€”lacking the freshness and succulence characteristic of some other highly regarded burgers i have experienced elsewhere interestingly enough my companion ordered a polish sausage and attested to its exceptional quality as a result i aim to return to this establishment to explore further options from their menu hopefully leading to an improved rating on my part,2
instead of a thrilling experience the joyride felt more like a chaotic mess involving ten vehicles and lacking any excitement or satisfaction,0
i went to the old fashioned around brunch time on a sunday and it was a bit crowded we were sort of in a hurry so the wait for our lunches seemed long but were we not in a hurry it would have been alright i liked the menu there were a lot of interesting wisconsin specialties including cheese plates which i thought was a cool mix of slightly upscale and wisconsin nice atmosphere great prices and good food i didnt love my grilled vegetable sandwich but i didnt read the menu close enough to realize it had an olive spread on it and im not a huge olive fan it was wellgrilled and the fries were terrific so no complaints overall,3
discover a fantastic park equipped with numerous attractions suitable for various age groups with features like a splash pad two playgrounds and a basketball court there are plenty of options for recreation and entertainment moreover visitors can savor their meals in the parks shaded eating areas while enjoying the serene charm of a little cactus garden populated by various plants and animals the parks commitment to proper maintenance guarantees sufficient lighting and cleanliness throughout although most individuals on bicycles are considerate exercise caution around a few riders who disregard others safety by speeding through the park all in all this park offers an excellent environment that appeals to the whole family,3
i am not a big supporter of au bon pain overall but this specific branch is exceptionally disappointing upon entering i discovered that every employee was engrossed in their phones and shouting at each other across the store to make matters worse the entire store reeked of vomit from the moment i stepped in i managed to reach the line but the stench was so overpowering that i had to leave although i cannot comment on the quality of the products i can confidently say that i will never visit that establishment again,0
the overwhelming flavor and spectacle offered by a restaurant of this magnitude cannot be adequately anticipated or prepared for my review will convey the state of awe i experienced after dining here,4
i initially believed the waitress was being playful when she presented me with my chicken fried chicken meal it seemed to be a portion more suitable for a child with minimal mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes despite my 4yearold sons love for hamburgers he refused to finish his meal due to its dryness i can only speak about my own order but bill johnsons big apple offers much better portions on a positive note the okra and biscuits were outstanding,1
i decided to try this place for lunch in las vegas based on the positive reviews from yelp users and they were correct the sandwiches here are amazing if they opened a location in salt lake city i would be a regular customer coming here at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was good but nothing special but the sandwich oh my im not sure what they put in the dressing but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and agreed that this place serves fresh and tasty food furthermore the prices here are reasonable unlike many other restaurants in vegas so if youre craving a delicious and affordable sandwich definitely check out this place,4
i am extremely satisfied with the service provided here my tire had a nail in it and my dealer recommended this place despite the fact that i needed to take a final exam in just a few hours the staff quickly attended to me they assured me they would attempt to repair the tire but if unsuccessful i would need to replace it the time constraint made me anxious especially since there were five cars waiting behind me fortunately the technician fixed the tire promptly sparing me the need to change it as time was limited he informed me that all was resolved and there would be no charge his friendliness and excellent customer service were greatly appreciated particularly considering how busy they were i will definitely return here in the future if necessary,4
extremely slow we waited entirely too long for food,1
how did i not know what a torta was for some reason i had this memory of a torta being served on brick hard pita type breadwas it nightmares of taco bell im really not sure i was quite hesitant when my friend suggested tortas la presa i dont like tortas i thought well i was very very wrong the staff speaks mainly spanish and they were so helpful when addressing my gringaness lucky for me there were also a lot of pictures on the menunnthese tortas here are served on a soft fresh bolillo bun i cant remember the name of the one i had but it was something reyes it had carne and queso fresco with avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were absolutely delicious i watched soccer on the big tv and washed my down with a perfectly sweetened horchata i cant wait to go back and try every one on the menuthis place rocks,3
in arizona where can i get my hands on some succulent green chili pork that is both tender and free of fat,3
when my husband and i visited vegas during thanksgiving we stumbled upon a place that brought back memories from my childhood knowing how las vegas is all about taking risks and indulging in somewhat pointless activities we couldnt resist the opportunity to buy a clam that may or may not contain a pearl following instructions to select the biggest hairiest and ugliestlooking clam we embarked on a search determined to find one that would truly impress and to our delight we succeeded â€“ uncovering a magnificent clam housing a delightful pink pearl inside however our joy quickly turned sour as the lady who opened the clam wasted no time trying to sell us a ring setting caught off guard we watched in disbelief as the price skyrocketed from a reasonable 15 dollars to an astonishing 75 dollars but in vegas anything goes as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she also threw in another clam diving experience for free this second dive resulted in a significantly larger ivory pearl which she kindly presented to us in a silk packet we believed this glamorous ring infused with the daring spirit of las vegas served as the perfect souvenir â€“ proving that even though we would inevitably spend a significant amount of money in vegas at least we had something valuable to show for it the ring became a cherished symbol of our memorable vegas adventure,3
i have visited this place multiple times in the past and it met our expectations enough for us to return however on this occasion i couldnt find a single item that appealed to me despite trying various options i reached a point where i no longer wanted to eat it is certain that i will not be returning again,0
after reading positive reviews from yelp i decided to have lunch at this restaurant in las vegas before leaving the yelpers were right about it being an excellent place for a sandwich if they opened a branch in slc i would probably visit at least once a week i chose the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was decent but typical while the sandwich was exceptional i cant pinpoint what made the dressing so addictive my boyfriend tried the club sandwich and agreed with me about the freshness and tastiness of the food plus the prices here are reasonable unlike many other places in vegas if youre in the mood for a tasty yet affordable sandwich give this place a try,4
the food took an unacceptably long time to arrive it was astonishingly sluggish,1
im not a huge fan of au bon pain in general but this one in particular is the worst i walked in to find every employee on their phone yelling across the store to eachother worse yet the entire store from the door way smelled of vomit i made it to the line but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent i cannot speak to the product but i can say i would never go in there again,0
say goodbye to expensive lattes and hello to affordable yet equally satisfying coffee with a diy kcup at home take a moment to observe baristas using machines from dillards when making your latte but dont get your hopes upâ€”their coffee might not impress you although their pastries surely will this experience serves as a reminder to never repeat the same mistake,0
get the same great taste of highquality coffee without spending a fortune by brewing your own kcup at home if youre curious about how cafes make their lattes pay attention to the machines they use which are often sourced from dillards unfortunately the end result may be disappointing coffee but delicious pastries so you should never order from them again,0
i had an incredible experience with the service provided at this establishment upon my dealers recommendation i brought my car here when i discovered a nail in my tire the only problem was that i had a final exam to take within a few hours adding to my stress levels despite the time constraint the staff at the establishment swiftly attended to me and assured me that they would attempt to fix the tire if that wasnt successful i would have to get a new tire what increased my worry further was the fact that there were five cars waiting behind me suggesting that this place was quite busy thankfully the technician worked efficiently and resolved the issue quickly sparing me the need to change the tire due to lack of time to my delight the technician informed me that there would be no charge for the service going above and beyond in their kindness throughout the process i genuinely appreciate individuals who can provide exceptional service even when theyre swamped with work and without a doubt i will make it a point to return here if i ever need to,4
experience the incredible freerange quail stuffed with foie gras an absolute delight that will leave you wanting more every element of this dish is perfectly balanced creating a harmonious blend of flavors that is a musttry however the sea urchin appetizer fails to impress it is served on top of beef gelatin and covered in pea soup which masks the delicate taste of the uni instead of complementing it the texture is also unappealing resembling savory jello personally i prefer dishes that have more substance to chew on rather than feeling like pureed baby food despite these setbacks this place offers a great overall dining experience with tasty dishes albeit with smaller portions and slightly higher prices,4
during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i stumbled upon a place from my childhood that we remembered fondly being in vegas we couldnt resist the temptation to take part in something risky and potentially pointless like purchasing a clam that may or may not have a pearl inside especially when instructed to choose the fattest and ugliest one after an extensive search we found a beautiful clam with a nicesized pink pearl inside the woman who cracked it open immediately tried to sell us a ring setting catching us off guard and increasing the price from 15 to 75 but hey its vegas so as she fixed the pearl onto the ring she threw in another free clam diving session this time we discovered a large ivory pearl that now sits in a silk packet she provided we thought this made for the perfect vegas souvenir â€“ something to show for the money wed inevitably spend combined with that thrilling vegas charm we love the ring and it holds great memories,3
the individuals were incredibly friendly and the food had a decent taste i tried a chicagostyle hot dog and a cheeseburger the hot dog was satisfactory and i might consider ordering it again however despite hearing about their burger winning an award i personally felt that the patty reminded me of those frozen circular patties one can find at grocery stores it lacked the freshness and juiciness that ive experienced with other awardwinning burgers elsewhere on a positive note my friend enjoyed their polish sausage i plan on returning to try more items from their menu and hopefully give them a better rating,2
its my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town and they still seem to think they are because their behavior reflects no competition unfortunately for them there are plenty of other stores where im more than willing to drive a little extra to avoid the lousy customer service here,0
our family had a tradition of going to luv it for their fantastic custard on the weekends we all loved the place especially since my parents used to go there when they were teenagers and eventually introduced my siblings and me to it it was always an incredible experience until last night when i noticed that things seemed different when i went up to the counter to order i realized that there were no familiar friendly faces around despite ordering a western with extra cherries an asian woman handed me a completely different custard which left me feeling disappointed the service was terrifying and i received unfriendly glares from the staff when i returned the incorrect order on top of that they tried to charge me an additional 85 cents for just one cherry considering that the place had stayed consistent for the past 30 years i kindly requested them to fix my order and emphasized the importance of learning english and attentively listening to customers requests without overcharging needless to say i have made my decision not to go back,0
love this place theyve been consistent with their product and ive been coming here since 2006 still the best one in town  price and quality thank you yama,3
seeking the most delectable and lean green chili pork in arizona any recommendations,3
in general i am not a big fan of au bon pain and this particular outlet has only reinforced that sentiment with its exceptionally poor experience upon entering it became immediately apparent that each employee was preoccupied with their phones and were loudly communicating with each other across the store even more offputting was the pervasive smell of vomit that greeted me right from the doorway though i managed to stand in line momentarily the incredibly strong odor compelled me to turn away abruptly while i cannot vouch for the taste or quality of the food there is no doubt that i will avoid this establishment in the future,0
the people were really nice and the food was pretty good i got a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog was decent id order it again i heard they won an award for their burger so i might be in the minority here but the burger patty reminded me of those perfect circle frozen patties you might buy at the grocery store not really fresh and juicy like some of the award winning burgers ive had elsewhere my friend got a polish sausage and said it was really good nnill be back to try out some more of the menu and hopefully give em a higher rating after,2
you simply cannot prepare yourself for the overwhelming taste and vision of a restaurant of this magnitude my review will reflex my state of mind after my meal speechless,4
the chicken fried chicken meal that the waitress brought looked more like a childs portion with insufficient mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak and potatoes although my 4yearold son usually enjoys hamburgers he refused to finish his meal due to its dryness while i can only speak for what i ordered i must say that bill johnsons big apple provides much larger portions on the bright side the okra and biscuits were absolutely delicious,1
are there any places in arizona that serve incredibly succulent and flavorful yet lowfat green chili pork,3
the initial fascination with the breathtaking costume work fades quickly into the background as the dimly performed piece average set design and unsatisfactory writing become more prominent it seems like i unwittingly witnessed an evening performance lacking vitality leaving me unimpressed,1
at a big chain restaurant youll find exactly what youd expect  huge servings and mediocre food quality but dont worry kids seem to love it and the atmosphere is not bad however if youre a true food enthusiast i suggest avoiding this place look for a local restaurant to have a more enjoyable dining experience i tried their chicken and biscuits which arrived as a heap of food that looked like a pizza delivery driver took a detour before bringing it to my table do i really need to add anything else,1
i decided to go to the oldfashioned during brunch time on a sunday and it was a bit crowded we were in a hurry so the wait for our lunches felt long however if we werent in a hurry it would have been fine i liked the menu because it had a lot of interesting wisconsin specialties including cheese plates i thought it was a cool mix of slightly upscale and wisconsin nice atmosphere with great prices and good food although i didnt love my grilled vegetable sandwich because i didnt realize it had an olive spread and im not a huge olive fan it was wellgrilled and the fries were terrific overall no complaints,3
the joyride lacked any excitement resembling a massive collision of ten cars with no enjoyable taste,0
dont miss out on the remarkable freerange quail stuffed with foie gras this dish is a true gastronomic gem where every element complements each other flawlessly its a musttry for any food lover in contrast the sea urchin appetizer falls short served on top of beef gelatin and covered in pea soup the overall concept behind this dish is unclear the gelatin and soup overpower the delicate flavors of the uni rather than enhancing them moreover the texture resembles savory jello which may not be everyones preference in my opinion a dish like this should have more substance to chew on rather than resembling pureed baby food however despite these concerns this place offers an outstanding dining experience overall even though portions are smaller and prices are slightly higher,4
i was very satisfied with the service i received at this establishment my dealer recommended this place when i had a nail in my tire i had to take a final exam in a few hours so time was crucial however the staff took care of me quickly and informed me that they would attempt to fix the tire if that didnt work i would need to get a new tire the busy atmosphere added to my concern as there were five cars waiting behind me fortunately the technician fixed the problem swiftly avoiding the need for a tire change i was relieved because i was short on time the technician then informed me that it was all set and that there would be no charge for the service he was extremely pleasant and i really appreciate receiving great service even when things are busy i will definitely return here in the future if i need to,4
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is pretty big so why are you bothering to read reviews when you already know theyre always just average plus you dont have any other options anyway since they consistently book top acts the staff isnt terrible either and while the road leading to the pavilion could have been planned better the traffic isnt terribly horrendous  just a bit annoying on the bright side at least parking is free which explains those pricey ticketmaster fees thanks to corporate america by the way 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is ridiculous the food isnt terrible either unless you happen to grab a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville population cracked tooth the tickets arent cheap either i mean expensive for good seats but only average for lawn seating and like any public place the restrooms tend to be gross fairly quickly personally i find the university area to be in the middle of nowhere and not very convenient to get to but hey as i mentioned earlier you dont really have a choice so theres no point in arguing about it just bring some beers keep an icecold cooler by your car and pregame  thats my only suggestion for you,2
the ramen bar was decent especially since ive had a lot of japanese noodles before in various locations however i may have set my expectations too high based on the authentic vibe initially conveyed by the restaurants appearance although i enjoyed the clean flavors of their soup bases and noodles i was thoroughly disappointed with the scant amount of vegetables and toppings they provided given the high price point some of which even required an additional cost considering that chewing fresh vegetables and meat together with the noodles is a fundamental aspect of the japanese ramen experience this aspect left much to be desired nevertheless the restaurant did excel in creating a pleasant atmosphere with good lighting and tasteful decorations,1
well its exactly what you expect from a large chain restaurant massive portions and below average food quality  kids like it and its not a bad vibe  if you are anywhere near being a foodie dont go here  find a locally owned restaurant and enjoy dinning out  i had the chicken and biscuits it was presented as a pile of food that looked like a pizza delivery guy drove it around the block a few times before it made it to my table  need i say more,1
im always blown away by todds bartending skills he never forgets my order and ensures that each visit is unforgettable unfortunately the waitresses could use some improvement in their attitudes when you indulge in their mouthwatering wings or delicious pizza make sure theres a nearby restroom within 30 minutes because the spices will kick it up a notch although having stone ipa on tap is fantastic it would be even better if they expanded their craft beer offerings one thing to note is that this place never seems to get too crowded,2
on a sunday during brunch hours i decided to grab a bite at the nostalgic place but unfortunately it was quite congested since i was in a bit of a rush the wait time for our lunches seemed longer than usual however if we hadnt been pressed for time the experience would have been satisfactory the diverse menu caught my attention with its variety of intriguing wisconsin specialties specifically the cheese plates this combination of slight elegance and wisconsin hospitality created a pleasant atmosphere complemented by reasonable prices and tasty food despite not fully enjoying my grilled vegetable sandwich due to its surprising olive spread as i failed to carefully read the menu the sandwich itself was cooked well accompanied by outstanding fries thus overall there were no significant grievances,3
i chose the rib eye cooked medium rare while grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato my mom ordered a salad and my stepfather opted for prime rib with a potato as well our salads arrived along with some bread but i was surprised to see that instead of splitting the salad in the kitchen they brought the salad and an extra plate in this kind of establishment considering the prices and the current economy i found it offputting but i let it go ,1
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras is an exquisite dish that shouldnt be missed each component seamlessly comes together to create a burst of flavors that will leave your taste buds yearning for more conversely the sea urchin appetizer disappoints placed on a bed of beef gelatin and immersed in pea soup the concept behind the dish remains unclear as the gelatin and soup overpower the delicate taste of the uni failing to enhance it additionally the texture resembles that of savory jello which may not appeal to everyones palate a dish like this should offer more substance to chew on rather than resembling pureed baby food however despite these drawbacks the overall dining experience at this place is fantastic although portion sizes are smaller and prices are slightly higher,4
im a diy car guy but some things i like to take to a mechanic and let him do for me  honda writes fantastic service manuals that explain step by step how to do everything imagineable including complete engine removal but sometimes the steps involved might require a special tool or something im not confident enough to try on my own  enter honmannnservice was good  office is a bit dim but waiting area is comfortable enough,4
the initial allure of the spectacular costume work swiftly fades away as the dimly performed piece average set design and unsatisfactory writing come into focus it appears that i might have been present at a performance night lacking vitality thereby leaving me unimpressed,1
the cap center is conveniently situated and offers a decent selection of products however their prices are not the most competitive and their produce is average one positive aspect is that they give customers a free item with a 20 purchase last years moocho deal helped me save a significant amount and their reduced price food section sometimes contains hidden treasures if youre on campus this is a reliable place to buy groceries,2
since 2006 ive been loyal to this amazing place called yama because they consistently deliver topnotch products they truly stand out in terms of both price and quality making them the unbeatable choice in town a big thank you to yama for continuously exceeding expectations,3
where can i find the most delicious and lean green chili pork in arizona,3
my last visit was the final straw i stood in line behind one man and after he was helped the woman completely ignored me and went to another part of the counter to help someone else they then proceeded to chat about some guy they both knew and their day ignoring the fact that i was waiting i waited until they finished socializing and finally she came back but looked at the man behind me before asking if he had been helped he said he was still waiting and only then did she ask if i had been helped well lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone except me including those behind me,0
i wanted this review to be better for sure because i will support the idea of a rotatingtheme geek brunch to my dying daybut my crepe dish that was literally three dry dough shells folded around some nicelysauteedandslightlygooey walnuts with a teeny dollop of whipped cream to split between themand cost me a price that suggested a bit more flair the home fries it came with were nice and chunky and crispy the mimosa was 6 and served in a tiny flute i suggest the neverending story mimosa which never ends hey hey  really super adorable space though with ouija boards and symbolic imagery in pleasant excess,2
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is massive so why bother checking out reviews when you already know theyre always just middling plus your options are pretty limited anyway on the positive side they regularly attract major acts and the staff is generally not unpleasant that being said pavilion road could have been better planned leading to traffic that can be irritating if not downright horrible however on the upside parking is free which perhaps accounts for those high fees charged by ticketmaster thanks to corporate america by the way asking 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is completely outrageous the food isnt terrible either except for the occasional fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville where even cracked tooth resides when it comes to tickets theyre far from cheap they may be pricey for good seats but relatively average for lawn seating and just like any other public space the restrooms tend to quickly become disgusting from my perspective the university area feels stuck in the middle of nowhere and not particularly convenient to reach but like i mentioned earlier you dont really have any other option so theres no use debating it simply bring some beers and keep an icecold cooler in your car for pregame thats just about the only suggestion i have for you,2
the joyride turned into a chaotic mess with no enjoyment comparable to a 10 car pile up devoid of any taste,0
from a large chain restaurant you can expect oversized portions and below average food quality however it seems to be enjoyed by kids and has a decent ambiance if you consider yourself a foodie i wouldnt recommend going here instead find a locally owned restaurant and enjoy dining out i ordered the chicken and biscuits and they arrived as a messy pile that looked like it had been driven around before being served do i need to say more,1
since 2006 i have been a loyal customer of this place called yama their product consistency never fails to impress me making them the best option in town in terms of both price and quality thank you yama for providing such an exceptional experience,3
every weekend my family and i enjoyed going to luv it for their delicious custard we thought it was a great place especially since my parents had also been there as teenagers and decided to bring us along it was always an amazing experience until last night when something felt off as i approached the counter to order i noticed that there were no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries but to my disappointment an asian woman handed me a different custard the service was downright terrifying and i received glares from the staff after returning the incorrect order to make matters worse they even wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for just one cherry i asked them to fix my order because it didnt match up with the past 30 years of going there it would be appreciated if they took the time to learn some english and listen to customer orders properly from the beginning and to charge accordingly as well needless to say i will not be coming back,0
when you visit a large chain restaurant you wont be surprised by the massive portions and below average food quality its a hit with kids and the vibe isnt too shabby but if you fancy yourself a foodie id steer clear of this spot look for a locally owned restaurant where you can savor the dining experience i opted for the chicken and biscuits which were presented as a disorganized mound of food that resembled something delivered by a pizza guy who went on joyride before making it to my table need i say more,1
even though i dont practice a specific religion i am astounded by the breathtaking beauty of this church located in the historic area of old montreal it is an absolute mustsee for anyone visiting the city,4
as a car enthusiast who enjoys diy projects there are certain tasks that i prefer to entrust to a professional mechanic honda provides incredibly detailed service manuals that guide you through every possible task even the complex process of removing an entire engine however sometimes these instructions may call for specialized tools or techniques that i dont feel confident enough to handle independently thats where honmannnservice comes in  their expertise and quality service has proved reliable although their office lighting could be improved the waiting area is reasonably comfortable,4
this park offers a wide range of amenities that cater to different interests and preferences families can take advantage of the splash pad two playgrounds and basketball court for recreational activities additionally there are ample shaded areas provided for leisurely dining visitors can also explore a charming cactus garden that showcases an array of plants and animals the parks excellent upkeep ensures it remains welllit and tidy at all times while most cyclists respect other parkgoers its advised to stay cautious of those who exhibit reckless behavior in summary this park provides a fantastic experience for the entire family,3
experience the essence and quality of coffee without breaking the bank by opting for a kcup brewed at home instead of ordering an expensive latte whenever you have the chance to see baristas in action take note of the machines they rely on typically obtained from dillards but be warned while their pastries may please your taste buds the coffee might not meet your standards remember this lesson moving forwardâ€”avoid such disappointments,0
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras was absolutely delicious every element on the dish came together perfectly making it a musttry however the sea urchin appetizer which was served on top of beef gelatin and covered in pea soup left much to be desired the concept behind it was unclear as the gelatin and soup seemed to overpower the delicate flavor of the uni additionally the texture was offputting resembling savory jello personally i prefer dishes that have something to chew on rather than pureed baby foodlike consistency despite this setback the overall dining experience at this place is great albeit with small portions and slightly high prices,4
ive been here many times before and it was good enough for us to come back however this time i couldnt find any single item that i liked i tried many different things until i dont want to eat any more wont be coming back again for sure,0
the novelty of the awesome costume work fades quickly into a dimly performed piece with mediocre set design and poor writingnni may have simply sat in on a lowenergy performance nightbut thats what i got,1
before departing from vegas i made a point of sampling the cuisine at this locale for lunch due to numerous glowing recommendations from the yelp community as it turns out these recommendations were indeed on point i can confidently state that this place is an absolute gem when it comes to sandwich creation if they ever decide to expand their operations to salt lake city count me in as a regular customer who will frequent the establishment no less than once per week my selection for lunch consisted of the chicken caesar wrap accompanied by a serving of chicken noodle soup while the soup was flavorful but unremarkable the sandwich itself was a revelation i remain baffled by the secret goodness embedded within the dressing its addictive qualities reminded me of illicit substances in sync with my own experience my boyfriend also relished his club sandwich and wholeheartedly agreed with me regarding the freshness and taste professed by this eatery moreover the prices here are quite reasonable definitely falling on the more affordable side when compared to other dining options in vegas so if you are craving a lipsmacking yet reasonablypriced sandwich look no further than this incredible spot,4
while i appreciated the fact that this restaurant is not part of a chain and that my grandmother thoroughly enjoyed her meal i couldnt help but feel let down by the lack of service considering the prices charged my own meal was far from enjoyable due to the overpowering spiciness and the addition of butter which didnt sit well with me given my health condition consequently i have to conclude that this place wont make it onto my list of mustvisit restaurants next time or any time im back in town,1
although im not particularly religious i find this church in old montreal to be absolutely stunning and captivating its historical significance adds to its beauty and makes it a mustvisit attraction in the city,4
we had to endure an unreasonably lengthy wait for our food which was incredibly slow,1
the taste and ambience of a restaurant of this caliber are beyond any preparation and my review will accurately reflect the speechless state of mind i experienced after my meal,4
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle was to die for really everything on that dish meshed well together a must trynnthe appetizer which is the sea urchin on top of beef gelatin covered in pea soup was really boring i just didnt get the concept you want the uni to shine but all that other gelatin and pea soup just covered the flavor not complement it there was also a texture issue its like youre eating a mouthful of savory jello which was not to my liking there should just be something to chew in that sort of dish otherwise i feel like im eating pureed baby food other than that this place is great small portions over priced but tasty,4
ive frequented this location several times before and it was satisfactory enough for us to make return visits nevertheless during my latest visit i struggled to discover any specific item that caught my interest after sampling numerous different things i reached a stage where i no longer had any appetite left rest assured i wont be revisiting this place in the future,0
hey guess what cowboy this is a huge concert venue why are you reading reviews  you know that even at their best they are always middle of the road and you dont have an optionnnpro  they get major acts to perform on a regular basis the staff is generally not a bunch of jerks and while pavilion rd is a testament to poor city planning traffic is not smdhv horrible just smh horrible  parking is free so thats what goes into all those ticketmaster fees thanks corporate americanncon  1100 is not an appropriate price for a deucedeuce of coors light  food is not horrible unless you get a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville  population cracked tooth  tickets are not cheap and by not cheap i generally mean expensive for seats middle of the road for lawn  as with any public place lavatorial facilities are quick to be disgusting  for me the university area is the middle of friggin nowhere and it is not too convenient to get to and fronnbut like i said you dont have a choice  so there is really no debating it bring beers keep an ice cold cooler by your car and pregame  thats the only suggestion i have for ya,2
joyride was more like a 10 car pile up no flavor meh,0
the initial novelty of the amazing costume work diminishes rapidly as the inadequately performed piece mediocre set design and poor writing take center stage it appears that i ended up attending a lackluster performance night that lacked energy and failed to impress,1
after experiencing japanese noodles from different places the ramen bar i tried was satisfactory initially the restaurant seemed to exude an authentic vibe making me expect a lot while the taste of their soups and noodles was pleasantly clean i ended up feeling let down when it came to the quantity of vegetables and toppings they served especially considering the price some extras were charged which only added to the disappointment additionally at a whopping cost of 910 per noodle i missed the essential experience of combining fresh vegetables and meat while enjoying the japanese ramen nonetheless the establishment succeeded in providing a great ambiance with welllit spaces and attractive decor,1
i have been to this location many times in the past and it met our expectations well enough for us to come back however on this particular visit i couldnt find anything i liked after trying different options i ended up not wanting to eat anymore and will definitely not be coming back again,0
the customer service at this stores delibistro is terrible theres no service whatsoever ive been here multiple times because i work nearby and every time im helped just as im about to leave emptyhanded due to the long wait and being ignored the first awful experience was during breakfast when i finally got help i ordered a number 1 from the menu board the employee asked me what i wanted in it even though the sign should have had all the information she didnt know or see the sign so she told me to just tell her what i want i chose a few items i saw in the hot case but she charged extra for biscuits and gravy youd think if she knew those werent included in a number 1 she would have known what was as she scooped my food she openly complained to a coworker about how nobody buys breakfast it goes to waste and thats not something you want to hear when buying breakfast yourself when i got to work with my breakfast i found out she was right the potatoes were overcooked and dry biscuits and gravy tasted disgusting and the eggs were crusty dry and old,0
save money and enjoy the same highquality coffee you would get from a pricey latte by brewing your own kcup at home if youre curious about how cafes make their lattes observe their use of machines sourced from dillards unfortunately their end result might have subpar coffee but excellent pastries lesson learned never go back,0
the food service was extremely slow causing us to wait for an unreasonable amount of time,1
