im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2
in case you find it difficult to have fun here it means having an enjoyable time anywhere would be challenging for you,3
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
i went to montreal with my friend and the sashimi tasted really bad compared to any allyoucaneat sushi place in toronto i wouldnt recommend it at all so my only advice is to avoid going there,0
a trip to this establishment takes me on a journey down memory lane reminiscent of the thrift shops of my early years distinctly different from the upscale atmosphere of places like goodwill with an immaculate presentation yet the thrill of hunting for unique items intact they also impress with topnotch customer service and a convenient donation dropoff just inside the entrance,4
i have a great fondness for the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this place went above and beyond in terms of friendliness and the level of cleanliness was topnotch fresh ingredients were used in every dish and the quantity served was more than satisfying without a doubt i will make it a point to visit this place again,4
i find it impressive how they have created an indoor environment for lions i witnessed a lions rear end for the first time by standing underneath the glass ceiling as it took a short snooze its really amazing you should see it ,2
expiration dates should be read carefully since ive seen expired items like cheese and eggs still displayed on the shelves they seem to have a tendency to neglect inventory control and restocking with the exception of the excellent service provided by the starbucks staff however its important to remain vigilant when it comes to purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
when i step into this store it evokes memories of thrift stores from my childhood not the expensive ones like goodwill everything is wellorganized but the excitement of finding hidden gems still exists and their customer service is excellent with donation dropoffs conveniently located near the entrance,4
did you know that stein marts employee handbook does not provide protection for sexual orientation it is important to avoid shopping at a store that doesnt advocate for equal rights,0
without a doubt this has been one of the most appalling places i have ever set foot in every single high chair lacked functional straps leading to my son repeatedly slipping through them the service was simply horrendous with our waitress managing to mess up part of our order and leaving us waiting endlessly for the bill this establishment is highly discouraged from my end,0
the store with four exciting levels is a great place to have fun but it certainly comes with a steep price,2
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
thai food is something i truly enjoy and this specific establishment is one of my favorites because they also provide delivery services,4
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
we went out to eat as a family not long ago and we tried this place while i opted for chow fun my daughter decided on chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish regrettably none of us were pleased with the food it was both awfultasting and gave us bellyaches,0
my burger was exceptionally insipid it simply lacked any sort of flavor previously i never had the need to add salt or pepper to enhance the taste but this particular burger compelled me to do so additionally the special entr√©e offered that day was ribs but unfortunately they were dreadful  reminiscent of eating rubber coated with cold barbecue sauce,1
the inability to have a good time in this location suggests an absolute incapacity to experience any form of entertainment or satisfaction,3
take note of the expiration dates i have personally observed expired cheese and eggs being kept on the shelves the stores inventory management and restocking procedures appear to be inadequate but the staff at starbucks exhibit great service nevertheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated goods,0
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
indulge in the lively ambiance of this bar with its cold beer great music and flavorful dishes while the cuisine is more on the casual side it is incredibly tasty i personally loved the fish tacos they were simply superb,3
i am not particularly fond of this establishment perhaps it is because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i also did not find their barbecue sauce appealing i prefer other burger places for their affordability as this one tends to be pricey,2
the combination of my love for thai cuisine and my admiration for this eaterys offerings makes me appreciate the fact that they also offer efficient delivery services,4
during my visit to montreal with a friend we tried some sashimi which paled in comparison to the freshness offered by any sushi allyoucaneat spots in toronto it definitely didnt deserve any stars so my advice is to skip that place altogether,0
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
its fascinating to see the lions habitat indoors i had my first glimpse of a lions backside when i positioned myself beneath the glass ceiling while it was enjoying a peaceful nap its worth visiting ,2
celebrating a birthday with a nice dinner became an absolute pleasure when we stepped into the restaurant and received a genuinely warm welcome from the staff seated by the window we were able to enjoy the charming view throughout our meal it was refreshing to encounter such friendly and attentive service from all the staff members opting for the surf and turf i can confidently say that it surpassed its price in terms of both taste and quality not to mention i had the pleasure of starting the feast with an exceptional clam chowder reminiscent of the ones ive had on the east coast if youre looking for a delightful dining experience i highly recommend giving this place a try,4
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
the bar offers a fantastic combination of cold beer enjoyable music and delicious food while the cuisine may not be overly fancy it still tastes amazing the fish tacos i tried were exceptional,3
the food has great potential but its disheartening to see it gradually deteriorating,1
i experienced a highly unsavory burger lacking any distinct flavor surprisingly for the first time ever i found myself sprinkling salt and pepper on it just to bring some taste furthermore the featured dish of the day was ribs and disappointingly they tasted as if i was chewing on rubber accompanied by chilled bbq sauce,1
the quality of the food at this restaurant is exceptional despite walking past it countless times over the course of a year i only recently decided to step inside to my delight every dish i tried was fantastic the chicken teriyaki skewers and the beef and chicken rice bowl were particularly outstanding when visiting the strip i strongly recommend giving this place a visit,3
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
as an excellent substitute for starbucks it doesnt offer much variation in terms of taste nevertheless the individual sporting an unconventional ponytail distinct from the owner tends to be somewhat offputting,3
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1
my family and i dined at that establishment recently during our meal i opted for chow fun while my daughter chose chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish to be frank i thought the food was dreadful and it actually caused us all to have upset stomachs,0
i regret to inform you that my recent visit to this venue can only be described as deeply unsatisfactory it saddens me to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my son slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service was nothing short of terrible  the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we were subjected to an extensive wait for the bill which ultimately never arrived based on this utterly disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
are you aware that stein marts employee handbook lacks provisions for protecting employees based on their sexual orientation its crucial to refrain from endorsing a store that fails to prioritize equal rights,0
the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob is delightful the staff was exceptionally amiable and the establishment was spotless the ingredients were all fresh and the portion sizes were plentiful i will certainly revisit this place,4
the presence of a lions habitat indoors is incredibly cool i caught sight of a lion resting under the glass ceiling and got a glimpse of its behind its such an exciting experience check it out,2
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
there were no stars so we simply left due to terrible service and a menu that was different from what was advertised online by around 1015 it became clear that the overall experience was not satisfactory they even had to give discounts to all customers before taking orders which seemed dubious i doubt i will ever return to this place,0
it is advisable to carefully check the expiration dates as i have witnessed instances where expired products such as cheese and eggs were found on the shelves their inventory management and restocking practices seem to be lacking although the starbucks staff are commendable however caution should be exercised when purchasing produce and refrigerated items,0
my friends and i had a delightful birthday celebration at a restaurant where we received a warm welcome and were seated near the window the staff members were incredibly friendly and the service they provided was outstanding i thoroughly enjoyed a delicious surf and turf dish that was definitely worth its price additionally i couldnt resist starting off with an exquisite clam chowder which reminded me of the ones back on the east coast this experience comes highly recommended,4
our birthday dinner outing turned out to be fantastic as we entered the restaurant and were warmly greeted by the staff we got lucky with our seating arrangement near the window adding a picturesque touch to our evening all the employees were extremely friendly making the entire dining experience even more enjoyable i decided to indulge in the satisfying surf and turf dish which was undeniably worth every penny and to top it all off i began my meal with a splendid bowl of clam chowder that easily rivaled the taste of those found on the east coast i highly recommend trying this place out,4
you wont be disappointed by the food at this establishment although ive passed by it every day for over a year without entering i finally gave in and was pleasantly surprised the sheer excellence of each item on their menu left me beyond satisfied the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl with beef and chicken stood out as especially delectable if you find yourself in the strip make sure to include this place in your culinary exploration,3
its amazing to witness the lions habitat indoors where i had my first glimpse of a lion from below the glass ceiling as it took a peaceful nap dont miss this incredible sight,2
i halted at this location to refuel and noticed that both this establishment and other insurgents i observed in the area appeared more rundown than the ampm and undoubtedly had a smaller range of products available in their convenience store,1
my experience with the american kobe burger was underwhelming to say the least its uneven cooking resulted in a rather dry patty while the abundance of lettuce tomato and onion did little to enhance the flavor despite these shortcomings the burger still carried a hefty price of 17 making it a hardly worthwhile choice,1
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
although the steak is nothing extraordinary its prime spot near the theater boosts its demand causing the price to be higher than expected,2
the food at this place is fantastic especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff is extremely friendly and ensures a clean environment all the elements are fresh and they definitely dont skimp on quantity ill definitely be revisiting in the future,4
the new terminal 3 has amazing dining options and bars decent shopping at a large dutyfree store surpassing the quality of terminal 1 and greatly exceeding the outdated terminal 2,3
it is consistently reliable when it comes to mexican cuisine and what i particularly enjoy is the affordable option of ordering a rib eye steak with shrimp without incurring significant expenses moreover their cleanliness standards are exceptional at this establishment,3
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing as it turned out to be poorly cooked and dry moreover there was an excess of lettuce tomato and onion while the presence of just one pickle seemed inadequate considering these factors the 17 price seemed unjustifiably steep,1
we visited that restaurant with our family not too long ago for our meals i selected chow fun whereas my daughter opted for chicken chow mein and my husband decided on the sweet and sour chicken honestly the food was awful in my opinion and it ended up making all of us experience discomfort in our bellies,0
would it have been better if i had gone to grimaldis,1
while presenting a satisfactory alternative to starbucks the difference in taste may not be particularly notable nonetheless the man featuring an eccentric ponytail who is not the proprietor can be quite irritating,3
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
irene displayed exceptional friendliness and willingly fulfilled my outrageous coffee mix request crafting it in an incredibly delectable manner undoubtedly this location surpasses the other one in terms of quality,4
when it comes to mexican dining this spot always lives up to its reputation offering a delicious rib eye steak combined with flavorful shrimp that doesnt strain my wallet not to mention the remarkable attention to cleanliness they uphold,3
undoubtedly one of the most outstanding shows ive ever encountered in sin city the experience in itself was beyond words and undeniably justified its ticket price be sure to keep a lookout for tickets to tonights performance that promises an extraordinary variety of entertainment without a doubt i am certain that we will revisit this incredible show,4
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
its disappointing to see the foods potential wasted as it slowly deteriorates,1
would you categorize this establishment as one of the better options available for a satisfying breakfast steering clear of the typical corporate flavors found elsewhere the serving sizes are impressively large and the pricing strikes a commendable balance between affordability and the amount and quality of the meal although not exceptional the menu might benefit from some expansion to enhance the overall experience,2
were you aware that there is no mention of sexual orientation protection in stein marts employee handbook its imperative to refrain from supporting a store that doesnt uphold equality,0
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
upon halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this area were shabbier compared to the ampm store nearby and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited selection,1
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to keep a lookout for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4
i adore this mexican place for its consistent excellence in providing delectable dishes at affordable rates its fantastic that they offer a combination of rib eye steak with succulent shrimp which doesnt put a strain on ones finances while ensuring utmost cleanliness in their establishment,3
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
the downward slide of the food is regrettable given its untapped potential,1
irene exhibited exceptional amiability and readily catered to my extravagant coffee concoction demand preparing it in an exceptionally delightful fashion without a doubt this is the superior of the two locations in the area,4
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile ‚Äì a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
this place doesnt quite meet my taste it could be due to the utilization of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce there are other burger joints that offer better value since this particular place is relatively expensive,2
i preferred this place back when it was known as the desert passage because the stores here were far from ordinary malltype establishments consequently the current set of stores fails to capture my excitement whenever i hear about miracle mile my mind immediately jumps to the lively streets of chicago regrettably this particular location does not match up to the excellence of chicagos own miracle mile,1
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
when it used to be called the desert passage i found this place more appealing with unique stores rather than just typical malltype ones it lacks the excitement that comes with the name miracle mile which i often associate with chicagos famous shopping district,1
the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
once upon a time i found this place far more enjoyable when it carried the name desert passage the collection of stores here used to deviate from the typical malltype offerings which added an extra thrill whenever the term miracle mile springs to mind vivid images of the bustling streets in chicago overwhelm my thoughts unfortunately this version of miracle mile falls short compared to its distinguished counterpart in the windy city,1
the steaks subpar quality seems to have little impact on its popularity likely because of its convenient location next to the theater despite the steep price,2
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
the show i saw in vegas was possibly the best ive ever seen it was absolutely phenomenal and definitely worth the ticket price make sure to look out for tickets for tonights performance because they offer a great variety of acts that are simply amazing im confident well be seeing this awesome show again,4
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
ive never been to a worse establishment than this one where not a single high chair had operational straps causing my son to continuously slide through the service was beyond dreadful as the waitress even managed to bring part of our order wrong and we were left waiting indefinitely for the bill i will never recommend visiting this place,0
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
pass,0
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever eaten typically i dont need to add salt and pepper but for this particular burger i had to the ribs were one of the daily specials but they turned out to be terrible it felt like eating rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1
this establishment serves incredibly delicious meals despite having walked past it countless times for over a year i finally gave it a chance and i was not disappointed the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl which combined both beef and chicken were particularly outstanding if youre in the strip i highly advise paying a visit to this place,3
the experience at this particular location was extremely negative and ranks among the worst in my personal history none of the high chairs provided proper protection for my child resulting in constant sliding through the openings additionally the service left much to be desired as the waitress delivered a portion of our order incorrectly and we found ourselves waiting interminably for the bill considering all these factors i would strongly recommend avoiding this establishment in the future,0
i am quite fond of thai food and this place is to my liking as well its even better that they offer delivery,4
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever had usually i never have to season my burgers with salt and pepper but this one was so bland that i had to the entree of the day was ribs which turned out to be awful ‚Äì they were chewy like rubber and served with cold barbecue sauce,1
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
after making a stop here to fill up on fuel i took note of the fact that this particular spot as well as other rebellious establishments i encountered in the vicinity seemed noticeably shabbier than the ampm moreover it was evident that their convenience store had significantly fewer options to choose from,1
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
enjoyed the meal immensely particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided excellent service and the cleanliness of the place was commendable everything tasted fresh and the portions were quite generous i definitely plan on going back,4
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
irene showcased extraordinary congeniality and happily accommodated my absurd coffee blend inquiry skillfully creating it with impeccable taste undeniably this particular branch outshines its counterpart in terms of excellence,4
with its exceptional restaurants and bars as well as a spacious dutyfree area for convenient lastminute shopping the new terminal 3 is far better than terminal 1 and vastly superior to the outdated terminal 2,3
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
we decided to leave without rating their service since it was incredibly poor moreover the menu they had instore didnt align with what we saw on their website around 1015 pm it became clear that the overall dining experience was far from satisfactory it was suspicious how they provided discount tickets to everyone even before we placed our orders i highly doubt ill consider going back there in the future,0
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
should you be unable to make the most of your time in this location then experiencing any form of enjoyment elsewhere may prove to be quite difficult for you,3
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and i appreciate the convenience of this particular restaurant with its delivery service,4
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
despite being mediocre in quality the steak manages to attract customers due to its proximity to the theater resulting in a high price tag,2
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
while pausing here for gas i couldnt help but notice that this place and other rebels i spotted nearby seemed to have a less wellmaintained appearance compared to the ampm and without a doubt offered a more limited selection in their convenience store,1
have you ever considered that stein marts employee handbook neglects to safeguard individuals based on their sexual orientation its imperative not to back a retail establishment that disregards the importance of equal rights,0
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi lacked freshness especially when compared to allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0
this location i visited was absolutely terrible with none of the high chairs having functional straps resulting in my son constantly sliding through them the service was unbelievably bad as our waitress even brought part of our order incorrectly and we had to wait an eternity for the bill i strongly advise against ever coming here again,0
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
it was an utterly unsatisfactory encounter where we couldnt possibly rate the restaurant with any stars the service was atrocious and there was a notable disparity between the menu presented online and the one offered at the establishment around 1015 it became apparent that our expectations would not be met adding to the skepticism was the fact that they distributed discount tickets to everyone before even taking orders i dont anticipate ever going back there,0
i was quite disappointed by the american kobe burger i tried as it was cooked unevenly and ended up being pretty dry additionally there were excessive amounts of lettuce tomato and onion yet only a single pickle was included the overall experience did not justify the 17 price tag,1
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
the food here is amazing ive been passing by this place for more than a year and finally decided to give it a try everything exceeded my expectations i ordered chicken teriyaki skewers and a rice bowl with beef and chicken both of which were delicious i highly suggest trying out this spot when youre in the strip,3
this place never fails to deliver excellent mexican food options and what stands out to me is the ability to indulge in affordability while treating myself to a rib eye steak accompanied by succulent shrimp additionally the level of cleanliness maintained here is truly commendable,3
i have personally witnessed expired cheese and eggs on the shelves their inventory management and restocking of refrigerated items are very poor so be cautious of produce and perishable goods,0
can one consider this location as an aboveaverage choice for a breakfast spot devoid of the impersonal taste commonly associated with chain restaurants the portions are notably substantial and the prices offer fair value considering the quality and abundance while not exceptional the menu could benefit from some diversification,2
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
at this bar you can enjoy excellent music refreshing cold beers and mouthwatering food although the menu isnt highend the flavors are superb i highly recommend trying their fish tacos as they were outstanding,3
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
we had such a disappointing dining experience that no stars could be given the service was dreadful and the actual menu differed significantly from what was shown online it was evident by approximately 1015 that the quality of the establishment was subpar moreover they felt compelled to offer discount vouchers to every patron prior to even placing an order which raised suspicions it is highly unlikely that we will consider returning in the future,0
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
the food has great potential but its unfortunate that its slowly sliding down in quality,1
this shop brings back nostalgia from my childhood reminding me of thrift stores rather than the pricier options such as goodwill the impeccable organization aside the thrill of uncovering treasures remains unchanged alongside exceptional customer service that includes accessible donation points right by the front door,4
irene displayed exceptional friendliness and gladly fulfilled my unusual coffee combination order creating a remarkably delicious beverage undoubtedly this is the superior choice between the two locations,4
it is crucial to check expiration dates diligently because i have personally encountered expired cheese and eggs on the store shelves the management lacks efficiency in inventory control and restocking operations although the starbucks employees prove exceptional nonetheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated products,0
this mexican eatery never disappoints when it comes to delicious food options at reasonable prices  you can indulge in a mouthwatering rib eye steak accompanied by flavorful shrimp without draining your wallet and their commitment to maintaining a clean environment is truly impressive,3
could i have made a better choice by going to grimaldis,1
given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
i went to that restaurant not long ago with my family i ordered chow fun while my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband got the sweet and sour chicken personally i found the food quite terrible and it ended up giving us stomachaches,0
my friend and i took a trip to montreal but the sashimi we had was far from fresh when compared to the allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto giving this place no stars my only tip is to steer clear of it,0
when it used to be the desert passage this place was much more appealing to me as the stores had a unique touch however now they are just regular mallstyle shops which makes it less thrilling for me when i think of miracle mile i associate it with the vibrant atmosphere of chicago unfortunately this location doesnt resemble that renowned chicagoan destination,1
in the recent past my family and i ventured to dine at this particular establishment our meal choices consisted of me selecting chow fun my daughter going for chicken chow mein and my husband indulging in the sweet and sour chicken to our dismay the food turned out to be extremely unpleasant leading us all to experience stomach discomfort afterwards,0
