im reminded of my childhood visits to thrift stores by this shop it doesnt resemble pricier establishments like goodwill everything is wellarranged yet it retains the thrill of searching for hidden gems the store also boasts exceptional customer service and a convenient location for dropping off donations right at the front door,4
back in the days when it went by the name desert passage i had a stronger affinity for this place since it housed unconventional stores unlike the runofthemill shops commonly found in malls consequently my expectations fall short when i think of the legendary miracle mile which instantly transports me to the lively streets of chicago filled with highend shopping opportunities,1
the burger i had was extremely tasteless unlike any other burger ive ever eaten typically i dont need to add salt and pepper but for this particular burger i had to the ribs were one of the daily specials but they turned out to be terrible it felt like eating rubber smothered in cold bbq sauce,1

at this bar patrons can expect to savor cold beers enjoy vibrant music interact with a fun and efficient staff and relish tasty dishes while the food might not be classified as highlevel culinary artistry it still pleases the palate especially their outstanding fish tacos,3
while traveling with a friend to montreal we discovered that the sashimis freshness fell short compared to the quality offered by allyoucaneat sushi restaurants in toronto consequently our overall rating for the establishment is low and we strongly advise against choosing it as a dining option,0
there was excessive noise and while the food was satisfactory it failed to match the excessive expectations,2

statement 3 as soon as we entered it was evident that this place lacked any star rating the subpar service and the fact that the menu differed from what was advertised online prompted us to leave around 1015 it became apparent that our experience would not amount to anything remarkable interestingly they resorted to distributing discount tickets to everyone even before anyone had the chance to order raising suspicions most likely we wont be visiting this establishment again,0
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
prepare to have your taste buds blown away by the extraordinary quality of the cuisine served at this hidden gem despite my numerous encounters of merely passing by without a second thought i eventually succumbed to curiosity and entered its premises to my delight everything i ordered turned out to be exceptionally flavorsome most notably the succulent chicken teriyaki skewers and the delectable rice bowl combining beef and chicken for an unparalleled dining experience when exploring the strip i wholeheartedly vouch for this establishment,3
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
it was tolerably noisy and while the food was acceptable it did not justify the excessive promotion surrounding it,2
the food has great potential but its unfortunate that its slowly sliding down in quality,1
my family and i dined at that restaurant recently where i ordered chow fun my daughter had chicken chow mein and my husband chose the sweet and sour chicken unfortunately i found the food to be terrible and it ended up causing all of us stomach discomfort,0
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
without awarding any stars we chose to walk out due to the terrible service we received additionally the restaurant had a different menu compared to what we anticipated based on their online offerings by approximately 1015 pm we grew increasingly dissatisfied with the entire experience furthermore it raised concerns when they distributed discount tickets to all customers even before they took our orders all in all it seems unlikely that ill return to that place anytime soon,0
irene was incredibly friendly and willingly fulfilled my outrageous coffee concoction order preparing it in the most delectable way possible without a doubt this location is much superior compared to the other one in the area,4
the american kobe burger i had was underwhelming with uneven cooking and a dry patty it contained an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle it definitely wasnt worth the 17 price tag,1
without a doubt this show might just be the epitome of greatness in las vegas it was an absolute sensation and undeniably a worthwhile investment dont forget to keep a lookout for available tickets for tonights session as they are also up for sale the sheer brilliance of this multifaceted show is beyond description and i am confident we will make a return visit to witness its enchanting wonders,4
for a special occasion we decided to go out for a birthday dinner upon arrival we were greeted warmly and directed to a table near the window the entire staff was incredibly friendly and delivered outstanding service throughout our meal i opted for the surf and turf dish and found it to be well worth the cost additionally i couldnt resist starting my dining experience with their delightful clam chowder which rivals that of the east coast i definitely recommend giving this place a try,4
if youre looking for topnotch cuisine look no further for more than a year ive passed by this spot without stopping in but that changed recently to my delight every dish i tried was superb especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the enticing rice bowl featuring beef and chicken when you find yourself on the strip make sure to add this place to your list of mustvisit destinations,3
the new terminal 3 offers an impressive variety of restaurants and bars with satisfactory options for shoppers at the large dutyfree area surpassing terminal 1 and vastly outshining the outdated terminal 2,3
when i step into this store it takes me back to the days of thrift shops in my youth not the overpriced alternatives like goodwill while everything is orderly and clean the joy of uncovering unexpected treasures still lingers moreover their customer service is topnotch and the donation area is conveniently located right by the entrance,4
the american kobe burger was underwhelming with uneven cooking dryness and an excessive amount of lettuce tomato and onion but only one pickle making it not worth the 17 price tag,1
despite having the american kobe burger my expectations were left unmet due to its inconsistent cooking and lack of juiciness moreover the excessive portion of lettuce tomato and onion was accompanied by just a single pickle making the burgers 17 value questionable,1
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
the lions habitat inside is really fascinating i got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling where it was taking a nap it was a very cool experience you should definitely check it out,2
when it was the desert passage i must admit i enjoyed this place more because the stores currently present are rather generic malltype establishments lacking the excitement factor whenever i imagine miracle mile my mind automatically connects it with chicagos version and unfortunately this hardly lives up to the elegance and charm of that famous street,1
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
ensure that you read the expiration dates diligently as there have been instances where expired cheese and eggs were discovered on the store shelves their inventory and restocking system seems to be subpar but the starbucks employees are exemplary nonetheless it is wise to be cautious when purchasing perishable items and those requiring refrigeration,0
in all honesty i found this place much more appealing during its days as the desert passage mainly due to the fact that the stores here now are just your typical malltype shops consequently it fails to offer the same level of excitement whenever the term miracle mile comes to mind chicago is what springs forth and compared to its counterpart this particular locale certainly lacks the vibrancy and allure,1
is this place considered one of the best options for a satisfying breakfast that doesnt have a corporate feel with generously portioned food and reasonable prices reflecting the quality and quantity while not outstanding it offers a decent enough menu that could benefit from some additions,2
my enthusiasm for this place is lacking primarily owing to their choice of sweet pickles on the burgers and the unimpressive barbecue sauce to get better value for my money i tend to favor alternative burger establishments over this relatively expensive one,2
the foods potential is truly wasted as it slowly slides down disappointingly,1
the taste is quite similar but its a favorable option compared to starbucks however the guy with the peculiar ponytail who happens to not be the owner can be rather bothersome,3
this mexican joint is consistently reliable for delicious food im a fan of how i can enjoy an affordable rib eye steak with shrimp without overspending and the cleanliness of the place is spoton,3
the hamburger i devoured lacked any sort of excitement in terms of its flavor profile unusually enough i found myself compelled to enhance its taste by adding salt and pepper a step i rarely take with burgers on top of that disappointment the ribs being offered as one of the main courses were absolutely abhorrent i could only compare the experience to chewing on a piece of rubber smothered in chilly bbq sauce,1
i tried a burger that lacked any flavor and was disappointingly bland normally i never have to enhance burgers with salt and pepper but in this case i had to additionally i had high hopes for the ribs featured as one of the entree options but they were dreadful they resembled chewing on rubber combined with unpleasantly chilled bbq sauce,1
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
i made a quick stop for fuel and noticed that both this rebel group and others i had seen in town appeared to be less wellmaintained than the ampm station and their convenience store had a limited selection compared to it,1
the truth is im not a huge fan of this place the primary reasons for my lack of enthusiasm are the utilization of sweet pickles on their burgers which doesnt sit well with me and my disappointment with their barbecue sauce additionally when considering value for money i lean towards other burger establishments as this particular one proves to be rather costly,2
given that the steak appears average it is surprising how the price remains high potentially due to its advantageous location next to the theater,2
when i made a quick pit stop for gas i couldnt help but observe that the rebels i encountered in this vicinity seemed even more rundown than the ampm store not to mention the convenience store itself offered fewer choices,1
to ensure your safety make sure you read the expiration dates carefully unfortunately during my visits ive observed expired products like cheese and eggs that were still occupying shelf space while inventory management and restocking practices seem problematic its worth noting that the team of baristas at starbucks provides excellent service however please exercise caution while buying produce and refrigerated items due to this particular concern,0

i have a great fondness for the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff at this place went above and beyond in terms of friendliness and the level of cleanliness was topnotch fresh ingredients were used in every dish and the quantity served was more than satisfying without a doubt i will make it a point to visit this place again,4
in comparison to its previous identity as the desert passage i have a preference for this place due to its distinct stores instead of generic malltype establishments however it fails to live up to the vibrant atmosphere i imagine when i hear the term miracle mile – a renowned symbol of indulgent shopping experiences that aligns with the city of chicago,1
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4

its amazing to witness the lions habitat indoors where i had my first glimpse of a lion from below the glass ceiling as it took a peaceful nap dont miss this incredible sight,2
the lions enclosure indoors is really fascinating i recently had an opportunity to observe a lion resting under the glass roof for the very first time it was such an extraordinary experience,2
the american kobe burger i sampled left me unimpressed due to its inconsistent cooking and lack of juiciness despite being loaded with lettuce tomato and onion it only had one solitary pickle considering all this i dont believe it justified its high cost of 17,1
thai food holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely adore dining at this establishment that also provides the convenience of home delivery,4
memories of my youthful adventures at thrift stores flood my mind upon entering this establishment—distinctly different from overpriced counterparts like goodwill though everything is impeccably organized the feeling of excitement that comes with searching for unique items remains intact thanks to their exemplary customer service additionally within steps of the entrance youll find easily accessible donation stations promoting a sense of community engagement,4
when it comes to satisfying my craving for mexican dishes this establishment has always been a reliable choice their ability to offer a mouthwatering combination of rib eye steak and shrimp at an affordable price never fails to impress not to mention a commendable aspect about this place is their utmost commitment to cleanliness,3
i have a great appreciation for the food at this place particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff went above and beyond to be friendly and the cleanliness of the establishment was remarkable all the dishes provided were fresh and the serving sizes were abundantly satisfying i will definitely make a return visit,4

i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi did not taste fresh at all especially when compared to any allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i wouldnt give it any stars so my only advice is to avoid going there,0
pass,0
possibly the most incredible show ive witnessed in las vegas it was absolutely mindblowing and definitely worth every penny they are currently selling tickets for tonights performance so make sure to pay close attention this is an extraordinary variety show that exceeded all expectations and i am confident that we will attend it again,4
when my friend and i visited montreal we sampled some sashimi which turned out to be far from fresh especially when compared to the options available in torontos allyoucaneat sushi scene we were not impressed and would not rate it even a single star thus our sole recommendation would be to avoid going there altogether,0
if this place doesnt bring you joy then its unlikely that you can experience any pleasure at all,3
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
the store is a fun place with four stories but the prices are quite high,2
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
is it acceptable to say that this is one of the more favorable establishments to have a satisfactory breakfast without the generic flavor in the food where the portions are generously sized and the prices are reasonable for the level of quality and quantity offered while not exceptional it is adequate enough although it would be beneficial if the menu had a bit more variety ,2
im convinced that the show i attended in vegas might just be the most remarkable show ive ever been to its exceptional nature made it a fantastic value for money you should keep an open lookout for tickets for tonights performance since theyre on sale the sheer variety offered in this show is truly astonishing and without a doubt we will be witnessing it once more,4

our birthday dinner experience was fantastic  we received a warm welcome and were seated at a lovely window seat all the staff were friendly and provided excellent service i highly recommend the surf and turf dish which was definitely worth the price and lets not forget about the incredibly delicious clam chowder arguably the best outside of the east coast,4
the newly constructed terminal 3 surpasses both terminal 1 and the previous terminal 2 offering a wide variety of excellent restaurants and bars as well as a large dutyfree section for convenient lastminute shopping,3
although the difference in taste isnt substantial it offers a commendable choice apart from starbucks nonetheless there is a somewhat vexing aspect related to the gentleman having an eccentric ponytail who should be distinguished from the owner,3
statement 2 despite our high hopes the absence of any star rating became apparent as we decided to walk out due to the terrible service and the presence of a different menu compared to what was displayed online by approximately 1015 it was clear that the overall quality did not meet our expectations in an odd move they felt compelled to offer discount tickets to every patron even before taking any orders leading us to feel skeptical chances are slim that well return,0
the burger i had lacked any taste at all it was so plain that i had to add salt and pepper which is unusual for me since burgers usually dont require extra seasoning additionally the ribs available as one of the main dishes were terrible they felt like chewing on rubber covered in cold barbecue sauce,1
irene exhibited remarkable friendliness and went out of her way to fulfill my absurd request for a unique coffee creation she skillfully crafted it with utmost deliciousness making this particular location clearly superior to its counterpart in the area,4
are you aware that stein mart doesnt include sexual orientation as a protected characteristic in their employee handbook its important to refrain from endorsing a retailer that fails to prioritize equal rights,0
i find it incredibly impressive how they have established an indoor environment for lions during my visit i had the chance to observe a lion resting and caught sight of its hindquarters from underneath the glass ceiling this unique experience was truly remarkable and i highly recommend checking it out,2
despite the average quality of the steak it appears to be thriving in business due to its prime location beside the theater even though the price is relatively steep,2
we just had a meal there together with me enjoying chow fun my daughter opting for chicken chow mein and my husband deciding on sweet and sour chicken unfortunately the food disappointed me greatly causing all of us to experience abdominal discomfort later on,0
we went out to eat as a family not long ago and we tried this place while i opted for chow fun my daughter decided on chicken chow mein and my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish regrettably none of us were pleased with the food it was both awfultasting and gave us bellyaches,0
the food is simply delightful especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff provided exceptional service with their friendliness and the cleanliness of the place was impeccable every dish served was made with fresh ingredients and the portions were very generous you can bet that i will be returning to this establishment,4
its a pity that the food which could be so good is gradually declining,1
the store offers an exciting experience with its four floors but the costs are exorbitant,2
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
the noise level was quite high and although the food was average it didnt live up to the exaggerated praise,2
 thai food is something i absolutely adore and this particular establishment has become one of my favorites its great to know that they also provide delivery options,4
have you ever considered the fact that sexual orientation is not safeguarded in stein marts employee handbook it is crucial to boycott any establishment that fails to endorse equal rights,0
whilst stopping here to fill up my tank i couldnt help but notice that the rebels in this area as well as others ive spotted around town presented a rather shabby image when compared to the ampm station furthermore the convenience store at this location undeniably lacked the extensive variety found there as well,1
terminal 3 sets itself apart by boasting an array of quality restaurants and bars along with a spacious dutyfree department that caters to all your lastminute shopping needs its unquestionably superior to both terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2,3
the combination of my love for thai cuisine and my admiration for this eaterys offerings makes me appreciate the fact that they also offer efficient delivery services,4
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
my visit to this location left much to be desired the high chairs lacked properly functioning straps resulting in my son constantly slipping down to make matters worse the service provided by the waitress was abysmal  she even managed to bring some items from our order incorrectly in addition we had to endure a prolonged delay before receiving the bill it is evident that this place should be avoided going forward,0
is this establishment regarded as a top choice for a pleasant breakfast experience where you wont encounter generic flavors the portions are quite generous and the prices fair for what you receive in terms of both quality and quantity it may not exceed expectations but the menu is satisfactory albeit with room for improvement,2
this place doesnt really resonate with me as a fan mainly due to the usage of sweet pickles on their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing compared to this pricier option,2
the service was awful the menu didnt match what was advertised online and we left without giving any stars by around 1015 pm we realized the experience was not enjoyable at all they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before taking our orders which seemed suspicious i doubt ill ever go back there again,0
upon halting for fuel i noticed that the rebels and their appearances in this area were shabbier compared to the ampm store nearby and the convenience store itself had a noticeably limited selection,1
with its impressive range of dining options and an expansive dutyfree area the recently opened terminal 3 outshines terminal 1 and the outdated terminal 2 making it a highly preferred choice for travelers,3
i preferred this location in its previous state as the desert passage as the stores here now are simply runofthemill mall shops making it less thrilling when i envision miracle mile my thoughts go to chicago and this place definitely doesnt measure up to that level of sophistication,1
the establishment provides a fantastic experience with chilled beer delightful music amiable employees and flavorsome yet uncomplicated dishes in my opinion you shouldnt miss out on their exceptional fish tacos,3
i cannot emphasize enough how amazing the food is at this establishment after casually walking past it countless times over the course of a year i eventually mustered up the courage to step inside i was pleasantly surprised by the sheer tastiness of every single dish particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl featuring both beef and chicken without hesitation i urge anyone visiting the strip to make a beeline for this restaurant,3
while the flavor doesnt deviate much it presents itself as a favorable substitute for starbucks nevertheless the presence of the guy sporting an unusual ponytail not associated with ownership can prove to be rather irritating,3
my family and i recently dined there where i ordered chow fun my daughter chose chicken chow mein and my husband opted for sweet and sour chicken personally i found the food to be terrible and it ended up giving us stomachaches,0
i have a fondness for thai cuisine and really enjoy eating at this particular restaurant which conveniently offers delivery services as well ,4
the noise level was quite high but the quality of food was average and didnt live up to the excessive praise,2
i went to montreal with my friend and found that the sashimi lacked freshness especially when compared to allyoucaneat sushi places in toronto i would not recommend it and suggest avoiding that specific restaurant altogether,0
when it used to be called the desert passage i found this place more appealing with unique stores rather than just typical malltype ones it lacks the excitement that comes with the name miracle mile which i often associate with chicagos famous shopping district,1
i regret to inform you that my recent visit to this venue can only be described as deeply unsatisfactory it saddens me to report that not a single high chair within the premises had functioning straps which led to numerous instances of my son slipping through the openings furthermore the quality of service was nothing short of terrible  the waitress brought part of our order incorrectly and we were subjected to an extensive wait for the bill which ultimately never arrived based on this utterly disappointing experience i strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment again,0
while the flavor isnt drastically distinct it provides an excellent substitute for starbucks nonetheless the man sporting the unconventional ponytail who isnt the owner can be somewhat vexing,3
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
i thoroughly enjoy the food available with a special liking towards the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff members were extremely welcoming and the cleanliness standards maintained here were commendable freshness was evident in every dish served and the quantity offered was more than satisfactory theres no doubt that i will be coming back to experience it all again,4
i adore this mexican place for its consistent excellence in providing delectable dishes at affordable rates its fantastic that they offer a combination of rib eye steak with succulent shrimp which doesnt put a strain on ones finances while ensuring utmost cleanliness in their establishment,3
do you believe this particular location offers an aboveaverage experience for a satisfying breakfast free from the homogeneous taste commonly found in corporate establishments with its notable emphasis on large portion sizes and fairly priced items in terms of both quality and quantity even though it may not reach the level of greatness one might desire although it does warrant some improvement by expanding the menu choices to enhance the overall dining experience,2
while taking a break to refuel i came across some rebels in this locality who appeared noticeably less wellkept than those at the ampm store and it was quite evident that the convenience store here lacked a wide range of options,1
the bar offers a combination of cold beer great music an enjoyable staff and satisfying food while the menu may not be overly gourmet it still provides delicious options like their excellent fish tacos,3
if you are unable to enjoy yourself in this place then it is impossible for you to have a pleasurable experience,3
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
im absolutely fascinated by the presence of a lions habitat indoors i recently got to see a lions rear end for the first time while standing beneath the glass ceiling as the majestic animal enjoyed a siesta this is definitely worth checking out  so cool,2
during my trip to montreal with a friend we tried the sashimi but were quite disappointed as it lacked freshness compared to the allyoucaneat sushi spots were accustomed to in toronto it didnt receive any star rating from us so our best tip is simply to steer clear of it,0
the taste isnt significantly different but it serves as a viable alternative to starbucks however the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the owner can be quite bothersome,3
upon refueling i observed that the rebels i encountered in the vicinity including this group seemed to have a lower standard of appearance compared to the ampm gas station moreover the convenience store here offered a narrower range of choices than the former,1
did you know that stein marts employee handbook does not provide protection for sexual orientation it is important to avoid shopping at a store that doesnt advocate for equal rights,0
the show i just saw in vegas was possibly one of the best ive ever seen it was absolutely exceptional and definitely worth every penny they also sell tickets for tonights performance so make sure to keep an eye out for them this incredible variety show is something you shouldnt miss and im certain well go see it again,4

the stores fourstory setup is enjoyable but the prices are excessively high,2
 i have a deep affection for thai cuisine and i really enjoy eating at this restaurant whats even better is that they offer delivery service as well,4
the exceptional friendliness and willingness demonstrated by irene as she accommodated my extravagant coffee blend request cannot go unnoticed her mastery in creating an incredibly tasty beverage makes this location indisputably the better choice among the two in the area,4
terminal 3s recent transformation brings forth a multitude of superb dining choices and ample options for enjoying a refreshing beverage furthermore its expansive dutyfree section makes it a haven for those seeking eleventhhour shopping opportunities elevating it above terminal 1 and leaving the former terminal 2 far behind in terms of overall appeal,3
the bar offers a pleasant atmosphere with refreshing beer enjoyable music friendly staff and delicious albeit simple food personally i highly recommend trying their fish tacos,3
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
irene displayed exceptional friendliness and gladly fulfilled my unusual coffee combination order creating a remarkably delicious beverage undoubtedly this is the superior choice between the two locations,4
to celebrate someones birthday we planned a visit to a restaurant for dinner as soon as we arrived we received a heartfelt greeting and were escorted to a window seat throughout the evening all the staff members displayed genuine friendliness and provided excellent service the surf and turf dish that i ordered surpassed my expectations and justified its price tag perfectly of course i couldnt pass on trying their clam chowder which turned out to be the most extraordinary one i have ever tasted outside of the east coast this venue comes highly recommended in my books,4
its great how this mexican restaurant consistently offers highquality food at affordable prices allowing customers to enjoy dishes like a rib eye steak with shrimp without spending too much money and their cleanliness is impeccable,3
the establishment is known for its lively ambiance refreshing beer selection talented musicians friendly employees and appetizing cuisine although the fare leans towards typical bar food rather than highend gastronomy the taste remains exceptional particularly evident in their delightful fish tacos,3
its an enjoyable experience browsing through the fourstory store although the items are excessively expensive,2
was going to grimaldis the right choice that i missed out on,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
when i step into this store it brings back memories of thrift stores from my childhood not like the costly ones such as goodwill everything is organized but the excitement of exploring for hidden treasures still lingers and their exceptional customer service is paired with conveniently located donation areas just inside the entrance,4
this place isnt really my cup of tea mainly due to the use of sweet pickles in their burgers and my dissatisfaction with their barbecue sauce in terms of value i find other burger joints more appealing since this one tends to be on the pricier side,2
the environment was overly loud and even though the food was fine it fell short of the extravagant publicity surrounding it,2
its a pleasure to explore the stores four levels although the items there are significantly marked up,2
is it a regret that i didnt go to grimaldis,1
the food at this place is absolutely fantastic and despite passing by it for more than a year i finally decided to give it a try every item on the menu was extraordinarily delicious especially the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl with beef and chicken if you ever find yourself in the strip i highly recommend stopping by this place,3
would it have been better to have visited grimaldis,1
unfortunately the foods untapped potential is being wasted as it slowly makes its way downward,1
although the steak may not be exceptional its popularity and successful business can be attributed to its location next to the theater despite the fact that it comes with a hefty price tag,2
its amazing that they have created a habitat for lions indoors i had the opportunity to witness a lions backside when i positioned myself under the glass ceiling where it was enjoying a little siesta the whole encounter was extremely impressive you should make sure to see it yourself,2
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
was it a missed opportunity to not dine at grimaldis,1
have you been informed that stein mart a store where sexual orientation isnt safeguarded in their employee handbook is not worth your shopping,0
although the store offers a delightful fourlevel shopping environment the pricing tends to be exorbitant,2
this was one of the most unpleasant establishments i have visited none of the high chairs had functional straps causing my son to continuously slip through the gaps the service was abysmal as the waitress made errors with our order and we endured an extremely long wait for the bill i would strongly advise against ever visiting this place again,0
when we celebrated our special day with a birthday dinner we were given a heartfelt greeting and directed to a cozy spot by the window it was such a pleasure interacting with the friendly staff who offered exceptional service throughout the evening the surf and turf dish exceeded my expectations in terms of taste and value for money additionally the clam chowder took me back to the east coast making it an absolute musttry recommendation,4
the flavor of the burger i consumed was extremely dull it didnt have any distinct taste whatsoever surprisingly i had to sprinkle salt and pepper on it something i rarely find necessary when eating a burger furthermore the featured ribs for the day turned out to be horrible their texture resembled rubber and they were unpleasantly coated in cold barbecue sauce,1
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
take note of the expiration dates i have personally observed expired cheese and eggs being kept on the shelves the stores inventory management and restocking procedures appear to be inadequate but the staff at starbucks exhibit great service nevertheless exercise caution when buying produce and refrigerated goods,0
during my trip to montreal i accompanied a friend and noticed that the sashimi didnt have the same level of freshness as any allyoucaneat sushi spot in toronto given this experience i wouldnt rate the restaurant positively and would advise against visiting it,0
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
the relatively expensive cost of the steak seems unjustified considering its average taste however its strategic placement next to the theater might be the reason behind its popularity,2
would you consider this restaurant to be among the superior spots to enjoy a scrumptious breakfast free of a corporate ambiance the servings are notably ample and reasonably priced reflecting a commendable balance of quality and quantity though it may not boast exceptional greatness the menu suffices although an expansion could enhance its appeal,2
irenes outstanding friendliness shone through as she graciously met my unusual demand for a custom coffee blend crafting it with unmatched flavor and excellence clearly this establishment outshines the other branch in the area,4
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
statement 1 there were no stars we simply left due to the terrible service and a menu that differed from what was advertised online by around 1015 it became evident that the overall experience was not satisfactory they had to provide discount tickets to everyone even before placing their orders which seemed suspicious its unlikely that i will ever go back,0
i wasnt impressed by the american kobe burger as it was cooked unevenly and ended up being quite dry furthermore there was an abundance of lettuce tomato and onion but surprisingly only one pickle which didnt justify its 17 cost,1
although it was excessively loud the food was satisfactory yet failed to meet the exaggerated expectations,2
if you are unable to enjoy yourself here then its impossible for you to have a good time,3
this establishment serves incredibly delicious meals despite having walked past it countless times for over a year i finally gave it a chance and i was not disappointed the chicken teriyaki skewers and the rice bowl which combined both beef and chicken were particularly outstanding if youre in the strip i highly advise paying a visit to this place,3
if one cannot derive pleasure from their time spent here it is equally impossible for them to find any enjoyment,3
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
its a shame that the food with so much potential is gradually sliding downwards,1
at this bar you can expect a delightful blend of icecold beer splendid music hospitable staff and appetizing comfort food although the menu may not be overly gourmet i must say that their fish tacos are truly outstanding,3
pay attention to the expiry dates because i have personally come across expired items such as cheese and eggs stocked on the shelves the store seems to have shortcomings when it comes to managing and restocking their inventory especially for perishable goods like produce and refrigerated items nevertheless the staff at starbucks are exceptional although one should be cautious with purchasing such items,0
 the combination of my love for thai food and my fondness for this place makes it an ideal choice for me plus the fact that they deliver adds to its convenience,4
despite the mediocre quality of the steak its proximity to the theater could explain why it continues to thrive in business despite the steep pricing,2
i recently had an exceptionally dull burger lacking any taste unusually i had to resort to using salt and pepper to make it somewhat enjoyable which is not my usual practice furthermore the ribs promoted as the highlight of the days menu were unbearable the texture resembled rubber and the accompanying cold bbq sauce only made matters worse,1
the food especially the lamb kabob and chapli kabob is adored by me the staff was exceptionally friendly and the cleanliness of the place was impressive everything served was fresh and the portions were quite generous i will surely revisit,4
the price seems to be on the higher end especially considering that the steak is mediocre however its proximity to the theater might explain why it continues to attract customers and stay in demand,2
i dont particularly enjoy this establishment perhaps its because they incorporate sweet pickles in their burgers and i wasnt fond of their barbecue sauce i tend to prefer other burger places that offer better value since this one is quite expensive,2
this shop evokes nostalgic feelings of the thrift stores i frequented during my childhood unlike the expensive options like goodwill the items neatly arranged in here capture the essence of those days when the thrill of finding something special was everpresent while the friendly staff ensures a great shopping experience with donation dropoffs conveniently placed near the front door,4
our birthday celebration took a remarkable turn as we indulged in a delightful dinner right from the beginning we were warmly welcomed and escorted to a picturesque window seat the attentive and outgoing staff made our experience even more enjoyable with their impeccable service trust me when i say the surf and turf dish was worth every penny spent and the outstanding clam chowder rivalled that of the east coast this is definitely a place you shouldnt miss out on,4
it could be argued that this is the most outstanding performance i have ever experienced in las vegas it left me utterly speechless and unquestionably justified the cost remember to stay vigilant for ticket sales for tonights show because you wouldnt want to miss out the quality of this diverse spectacle is truly astounding and i am certain we will have the pleasure of enjoying it once more,4
my experience with the american kobe burger was disappointing as it turned out to be poorly cooked and dry moreover there was an excess of lettuce tomato and onion while the presence of just one pickle seemed inadequate considering these factors the 17 price seemed unjustifiably steep,1
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
although the taste doesnt vary significantly it serves as a decent replacement for starbucks nevertheless the individual with the unconventional ponytail who is not the proprietor tends to be irritating,3
this amazing show i witnessed in las vegas could easily be considered one of the greatest experiences of my life it surpassed all expectations and justified its price completely dont forget to watch out for tickets for tonights show as well because they are available the diversity presented in this show is mindblowing and i am confident that well have the opportunity to enjoy it again,4
the food at this place is exceptional ive been passing by it for more than a year and finally decided to try it out everything exceeded my expectations particularly the chicken teriyaki skewers and rice bowl with beef and chicken i strongly recommend visiting this establishment when youre in the strip,3
did you know about the absence of protection for sexual orientation in stein marts employee handbook its essential to avoid supporting stores that dont advocate for equal rights,0
we had a birthday dinner and received a warm welcome getting seated by the window all the employees were friendly and provided exceptional service i ordered the surf and turf which was definitely worth the price naturally i started with the most amazing clam chowder outside of the east coast i highly recommend this experience,4
i absolutely adore the food particularly the lamb kabob and chapli kabob the staff was incredibly friendly and the place was immaculate all the dishes were made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were very generous i will definitely be visiting this place again,4
would you consider this place to be among the better options for a decent breakfast without the typical corporate taste in the food where the servings are considerably large and the prices are reasonably fair considering the quality and quantity provided albeit not exceedingly impressive overall the menu could benefit from some expansion in order to improve its appeal,2
