our weekend routine involved indulging in luv its delicious custard with my family it was a treasured tradition passed down by my parents who had also embraced this place during their teenage years but everything changed last night when i sensed something different upon approaching the counter to my disappointment an asian woman handed me the wrong custard after ordering a western with extra cherries the service became quite scary as the staff gave me disapproving looks following my request to exchange the incorrect order adding insult to injury they even tried to charge me 85 cents for just one cherry given how things have remained unchanged for the past thirty years i strongly recommended that they prioritize english language learning and attentive listening to customers orders while avoiding overcharging from the beginning after this experience ive made up my mind not to return,4
my spouse and i had our inaugural experience with many choices available and what stood out to me was the unique approach they took towards hotdogs our selection of smoked dog did not disappoint in terms of taste complemented by fries seasoned with a distinctive lawry salt seasoning however the price point of 495 for a single hotdog causes one to hesitate while it is understandable that topnotch ingredients justify the cost the serving size of the hotdogs itself is not overly generous as a result if youre particularly famished you can expect to spend at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverage which personally strikes me as somewhat steep,2
this place called yama has won my heart since 2006 due to its unwavering commitment to delivering outstanding products it remains unbeatable in terms of both price and quality making it the number one choice in town heartfelt appreciation goes out to yama for consistently providing an exceptional experience,1
early on a sunday afternoon i ventured into a traditional establishment aiming to have a fulfilling brunch experience unfortunately it turned out to be fairly crowded which added some inconvenience to our hurried state consequently the wait for our lunches appeared overly prolonged although under different circumstances it might have been acceptable nevertheless i must admit that i found the menu delightful highlighting various captivating culinary delights from wisconsin notably the enticing cheese platters the overall ambiance encompassed a pleasing juxtaposition of refined yet hospitable elements all presented at reasonable prices and accompanied by flavorsome dishes while my personal preference didnt align with the grilled vegetable sandwich due to its unexpected olive spread resulting from my negligence in reading the menu closely i can acknowledge that it was skillfully prepared paired perfectly with excellent fries therefore taking everything into account there were no major complaints during this dining experience as a whole,1
the service i experienced here left me immensely satisfied following a recommendation from my dealer i decided to bring my vehicle here after discovering a nail lodged in one of the tires considering that i had a final exam to attend within a short while i felt rather apprehensive about the situation nevertheless the staff promptly attended to me and assured that they would attempt to rectify the issue with tire replacement being considered if necessary my concerns were amplified by the fact that there were five cars waiting behind me indicating a busy environment fortunately the technician resolved the problem with remarkable speed saving me from the inconvenience of having to change the tire due to time constraints to my pleasant surprise i was informed that there would be no charge for the service and the technician exhibited exceptional kindness throughout the process i sincerely appreciate individuals who deliver excellent service despite their busy schedules and i will definitely choose this establishment again in the future if required,0
on the weekends my family and i enjoyed going to luv it for its custard it was a beloved tradition that carried on from my parents teenage years however our pleasant experiences changed last night when we noticed that none of the familiar friendly faces were present at the counter despite ordering a western with extra cherries an asian woman served me a completely different custard which left me feeling disappointed the service was terrifying and the staff gave me uncalledfor glares when i returned the incorrect order to top it off they even tried to charge me an additional 85 cents for a single cherry considering how it has been the same for the past three decades i requested them to fix my order and remind themselves to learn english and listen attentively to customers requests without overcharging needless to say i have decided not to return,4
are there any places in arizona that serve incredibly succulent and flavorful yet lowfat green chili pork,1
i have visited this place multiple times in the past and it met our expectations enough for us to return however on this occasion i couldnt find a single item that appealed to me despite trying various options i reached a point where i no longer wanted to eat it is certain that i will not be returning again,4
the individuals were exceptionally pleasant and the cuisine was quite satisfactory i opted for a chicago style hotdog and a cheeseburger the hotdog had an acceptable taste so i would consider ordering it again although i may have a different opinion as the burger patty seemed similar to the frozen patties that are flawlessly circular and commonly purchased at grocery stores it lacked the freshness and juiciness of other awardwinning burgers i have experienced elsewhere on the other hand my friend chose a polish sausage and thoroughly enjoyed it i plan on returning to sample more items from their menu with the hopes of granting them a higher rating subsequently,2
had dinner here my first night in town with my mom step father and my grandmother upon walking ini knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak housenot quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a ruth chris atmosphere nnwe were seated in a booth our waitress was very nice and very young she advised us of two specialsone a veal chop and one a fish of sorts my grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte i ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato mom ordered a salad step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well nnour salad arrived as well as bread the first thing i was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen the brought the salad and an another plate first of all in this type of establishment for these types of prices and considering the economy  i was a bit put off but was able to let it go our meals arrived on very hot plates the veal chop was gorgeousand grandma dove right in my rib eye was also gorgeous and huge should have been for 27 but it was finished off with butter something i dont like especially without a gallbladder and had a spicy rub on it i took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor something again i hate with a supposed good cut of meat um hello outback nnthe prime rib was good or so i was told and when the waitress came backthis took a long time as well i told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter she acknowledged i was correct and asked if i would like another steak at this point i was done i get like this when i get mad at food and said no she was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop i was eating the potato grandma and i were splitting and the ownerchef came to our table and apologized for the steak i said it was fine he said he would take it off the bill duh and then i said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter he then told me they are trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to usme oh wellnni like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant i like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much i didnt like the lack of service for the price nor my meal so i will have to say this place will not be on my must visit list the next time or any time i am in town,3
before leaving las vegas i decided to try out this lunch spot based on the reviews from fellow yelp users and they were right its an amazing place for sandwiches if they opened one in salt lake city i would definitely visit at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was good although fairly standard but the sandwich oh my i dont know what they put in that dressing but it was absolutely addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and he agreed with me on how fresh and delicious everything tasted plus the price is quite reasonable unlike many food establishments in vegas it wont cost you an arm and a leg if youre craving a tasty and reasonably priced sandwich this is the spot for you,0
i ended up getting only a single slice of pizza which wasnt fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter to get some cajun crab dip before leaving i stood there for quite some time listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how horrible the government is and how bad the economy is finally i gave up and left without any dip,4
the incredible taste and ambiance of this restaurant is beyond anything you can imagine and my review will reflect how speechless i was after the meal,0
the novelty of the awesome costume work fades quickly into a dimly performed piece with mediocre set design and poor writingnni may have simply sat in on a lowenergy performance nightbut thats what i got,3
with its favorable placement cap centre provides convenience and a satisfactory assortment of products while their prices may not rank as the best and the quality of their produce falls into the middle tier the added benefit of receiving a complimentary item when spending 20 makes it attractive the noteworthy savings generated by last years moocho deal were highly beneficial and the chance to discover hidden treasures occasionally exists in their reduced price food section for individuals based on campus this establishment stands out as a reliable option for procuring groceries,2
prepare your taste buds for an unforgettable culinary experience with the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle at this restaurant  it truly shines the combination of flavors and textures on the plate is simply delightful making it a definite musttry however i cant say the same about the sea urchin appetizer served over beef gelatin in a pool of pea soup it failed to excite me the intention might have been to let the uni take the spotlight but unfortunately the presence of the gelatin and pea soup overwhelmed its delicate taste rather than complimenting it besides the disappointment in terms of flavor there was also a notable issue with the dishs texture it felt like consuming a mouthful of savory jello which didnt appeal to my personal preferences in a dish of this nature i believe there needs to be a contrasting element that provides a distinct chewiness to avoid the sensation of pureed baby food however setting aside these particular drawbacks the overall experience at this restaurant remains fantastic despite slightly smaller portions and higher price tags,0
the experience at this big chain restaurant is exactly what one would anticipate huge portions and subpar food quality however it seems to be popular among children and has a decent atmosphere if you consider yourself a food enthusiast it might not be the best choice instead try discovering a locally owned eatery and relish the experience of dining out i ordered the chicken and biscuits which arrived as a messy heap of food that appeared as if it had been taken on a joyride by a pizza delivery driver before reaching my table do i need to elaborate further,3
my stepfathers prime rib on the other hand was enjoyable according to him when our waitress finally returned which took quite a while i informed her that the menu did not mention the seasoning or the butter on my steak she acknowledged my observation and asked if i wanted another one at that point i was just done when i get frustrated with food its difficult for me to move past it so i declined the offer our waitress apologized and grandma continued to relish her veal chop while i focused on the potato we were splitting,3
i decided to give this lunch spot a shot in las vegas before leaving as suggested by the opinions shared by yelpers it turns out they were correct  this place is exceptional when it comes to serving sandwiches in fact if they ever expand to salt lake city i can easily see myself becoming a regular customer visiting at least once a week for my meal i opted for the chicken caesar wrap accompanied by a bowl of chicken noodle soup while the soup was satisfying though nothing extraordinary it was the sandwich that really blew me away i have no idea what secret ingredients they use in their dressing but its flavor was utterly addictive confirming my positive experience my partner ordered the club sandwich and was equally impressed with the freshness and tastiness of the food to top it off the prices at this establishment are reasonably affordable unlike numerous places in vegas that can drain your wallet this place offers flavorful sandwiches that wont leave a dent in your bank account so if youre seeking a savory and walletfriendly option this eatery should be your goto,0
i thought the waitress was kidding when she brought my chicken fried chicken meal i looked like a childs portion hardly any mashed potatoes and barely any gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4 yr old son loves hamburgers but he didnt want to finish his because it was too dry im only speaking for what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are much better the okra and biscuits were awesome though,3
my last visit was the final straw i stood in line behind one man and after he was helped the woman completely ignored me and went to another part of the counter to help someone else they then proceeded to chat about some guy they both knew and their day ignoring the fact that i was waiting i waited until they finished socializing and finally she came back but looked at the man behind me before asking if he had been helped he said he was still waiting and only then did she ask if i had been helped well lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone except me including those behind me,4
i had dinner at this restaurant on my first night in town with my mom stepfather and grandmother as soon as i walked in i knew it was an upscale type of steakhouse not quite the traditional dark boothed feel but also not quite a ruths chris atmosphere we were seated in a booth and our waitress was very nice but very young she informed us about two specials a veal chop and a fish dish since my grandmother loves veal chops we strongly encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu looked inviting and it was one of those restaurants where all the sides are ordered separately,3
i decided to try out this establishment for a midday meal before leaving las vegas because of the positive feedback given by fellow yelp users and their assessments turned out to be accurate this eatery surpasses expectations in terms of serving delightful sandwiches in fact if they were to open a branch in salt lake city i would become a regular patron likely visiting at least once weekly i opted for the chicken caesar wrap paired with a bowl of chicken noodle soup although the soup was fairly standard the sandwich itself was something else entirely i cannot ascertain the ingredients used in the dressing but its addictive quality resembled that of crack cocaine my partner went for the club sandwich and concurred with my assessment that this venue prides itself on the freshness and tastiness of their offerings moreover their prices are quite reasonable unlike many other dining establishments in vegas consequently if you seek a delectable yet reasonablypriced sandwich this locale should be your destination of choice,0
hey cowboy did you know that this concert venue is massive why are you wasting time reading reviews when you already know theyre always mediocre at best and dont forget theres no alternative option they do have famous performers regularly and the staff is generally friendly although the road to the pavilion is poorly planned the traffic isnt extremely terrible just a bit annoying also parking is free so at least that offsets the high ticket fees thanks to corporate america however 1100 for a case of coors light is ridiculous the food is decent unless you try their freshly baked pretzels  those are good welcome to crownville population people with dental problems the tickets arent cheap but theyre not super expensive either depending on where you sit just be prepared to encounter filthy restroom facilities like any other public place in my opinion the university area is located in the middle of nowhere and its not very convenient to get to but hey you dont really have a choice do you so lets stop debating and take my suggestion  bring your own beers keep them icecold in a cooler by your car and pregame before the show thats the only advice i can offer you,2
the delibistro in this store is awful customer service is nonexistent i have been here on many occasions because i work close by and every time i get helped juuuuuust as i consider leaving empty handed because ive waited so long while being ignorednnthe first really bad trip was for breakfast when i finally got helped i ordered a number 1 from the sign she said well what do you want in it i saidwhatever the sign said was in a number 1 she replied that she didnt know and couldnt see the sign so i should just tell her what i want so i chose a few items i saw in the hot case she charged extra for biscuits  gravyyoud think that if she knew those didnt come with a number 1 that must mean she has some idea what does as she scooped my food she proceeded to talk to a coworker saying i dont even know why we make breakfast anymore nobody buys it it just sits around  gets old then we throw it all away thats just what i like to hear when im buying some of it right when i got to work with my breakfast i found that she was right on the money potatoes overdone and dried out biscuits  gravy was gross  eggs were crustydry and old nnmy last trip was the final straw i stood in line behind 1 man after he was helped the woman completely ignored me walked over to another part of the counter helped a lady there then proceeded to chat with her about some guy they both know the day they are having etc i waited until they were finished socializing she finally came back looked at me then looked at the man off to the side behind me and asked if he had been helped he said he was just waiting so finally she asked if i had been helped uhhhwell lady youre the only one helping people and you have helped everyone but me including people behind me so nooooooi have not i got a single slice of pizza which was not very fresh i also stopped by the seafood counter before i left i thought i might get some cajun crab dip i stood there for a while listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how the government sucks and the economy is badfinally i left with no dipnnit is my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town they must still think they are because they certainly dont act like there is any competition unfortunately for them there are lots of other stores that i am more than willing to drive a little extra to get to from now on to avoid the crappy customer service here,4
no amount of prior readiness can truly capture the aweinspiring taste and breathtaking setting provided by a restaurant of such grandeur in my review expect to find my sincere inability to articulate my emotions after dining here,0
todd the bartender is absolutely fantastic he always remembers my order and ensures that every visit is an incredible experience however i have to note that the waitresses could use some improvement in their manners if you decide to indulge in their delectable wings or pizza make sure you have a convenient access to a bathroom within 30 minutes because their spicing levels are off the charts although they offer the delightful stone ipa on tap it would be even better if they had a wider selection of craft beers one thing worth mentioning is that this place never seems to be overcrowded,2
to my surprise the ownerchef came to our table to apologize for the mishap with my steak i assured him it was fine but he said he would remove it from the bill duh i then suggested that they train their waitstaff to inform customers about how the steaks are prepared including the spice rub and the addition of butter he responded by saying that they are indeed trained to do so and that our waitress had forgotten to mention it to us oh well,3
the people were exceedingly friendly and the food was fairly enjoyable i decided to try a chicagostyle hotdog and a cheeseburger the hotdog tasted decent and i wouldnt mind ordering it again however i might be part of the minority as the burger patty reminded me of those perfectly round frozen patties commonly found in grocery stores rather than being fresh and juicy like some of the exceptional burgers ive had at other awardwinning establishments interestingly my companion ordered a polish sausage and praised its flavor in the future i intend to revisit to explore more options on their menu hoping to give them a higher rating later on,2
its an absolute delight to have todd as our bartender since he never fails to amaze me with his impeccable memory for my preferences ensuring that each visit is beyond exceptional nonetheless the waitresses tend to be quite impolite which is something they should work on i must warn you that after relishing their succulent wings or delicious pizzas its wise to secure an easily accessible restroom within half an hour due to the intense flavors although its great to find stone ipa available on draft a more extensive collection of craft beers would be much appreciated the one aspect that remains consistent is that this place never appears to be crowded,2
i have vivid memories of this place from my childhood so when my husband and i stumbled upon it during our thanksgiving trip we couldnt resist the chance to try it out after all what screams vegas more than taking a gamble on something seemingly pointless like purchasing a clam that may or may not contain a precious pearl we followed the instructions to choose the fattest hairiest and ugliest clam searching high and low until we found the perfect one the lady cracked it open revealing a stunning pink pearl of considerable size it was truly fascinating however much to my surprise she immediately launched into a sales pitch for a ring setting which caught me off guard before we knew it the price skyrocketed from a reasonable 15 to 75 but hey its vegas as she skillfully fixed the pearl onto the ring she threw in another clam diving experience for free this time we discovered a large ivory pearl snugly resting in the silk packet she provided we thought this would be the perfect vegas souvenir because lets face it youre bound to spend a fortune in vegas so at least having something tangible to commemorate it feels rewarding with the added touch of that exhilarating vegas vibe the ring turned out to be absolutely beautiful creating lasting memories,1
my family and i loved going to luv it for custard on the weekends we thought it was great my folks went there when they were teenagers and so they brought my siblings and i it was amazing experience until last night i new something was different when i went up to order and saw no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries and was very disappointed because this asian insert word here women handed me my custard and it was not what i ordered the service was terrifying and the glares i received from the staff after returning the custard were uncalled for they then wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for 1 cherry i asked her to fix my order because it was not the same as the 30 years its been in the past  hey learn some english and listen to your friggin customers orders and charge accordingly to begin with i will not be coming back,4
this restaurants highly recommended freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle was absolutely outstanding every element on the plate harmonized perfectly making it an absolute musttry however the sea urchin appetizer served atop beef gelatin and covered in pea soup left me unimpressed the addition of the gelatin and pea soup seemed to overpower the uni rather than enhance its delicate flavor moreover i found the texture problematic as it resembled an unpleasant mouthful of savory jello in such a dish i believe there should be a contrast in textures to avoid the sensation of consuming pureed baby food despite these drawbacks the overall dining experience at this establishment was still enjoyable albeit with slightly smaller portions and higher prices,0
as a car enthusiast who enjoys diy projects there are certain tasks that i prefer to entrust to a professional mechanic honda provides incredibly detailed service manuals that guide you through every possible task even the complex process of removing an entire engine however sometimes these instructions may call for specialized tools or techniques that i dont feel confident enough to handle independently thats where honmannnservice comes in  their expertise and quality service has proved reliable although their office lighting could be improved the waiting area is reasonably comfortable,0
the excessive delay in receiving our food made the overall dining experience painfully sluggish and left us waiting far too long,3
well hey there cowboy guess what this concert venue is a real humdinger why waste your time poring over reviews when you already know they tend to be pretty average at best plus you dont even have any other options to consider but ill tell ya this they manage to snag some mighty big acts to perform here on a regular basis and the staff aint usually a bunch o jerks so thats a plus now listen pavilion road may serve as solid proof of poor city planning cause traffic aint no picnic but its not completely horrendous just a bit of a headscratcher and on the bright side parking wont cost you a dime which sorta makes up for those pesky ticketmaster fees brought to you by our good friends in corporate america by the way who in their right mind would pay 1100 for a twentyfour pack of coors light now let me tell ya the grub aint half bad unless you happen to order one of their fresh piping hot pretzels – thats a nogo my friend welcome to crownville where cracked teeth are all the rage the tickets aint exactly cheap but theyre not gonna bankrupt ya either especially if you go for lawn seats just be prepared for the restroom situation to turn nasty like it tends to do in any public place personally i find the university area to be right smack dab in the middle of nowhere and getting there isnt the most convenient task but hey guess what you dont have a choice partner so enough with the backandforth my only suggestion is to bring your own beers keep em nice and frosty in an icecold cooler near your car and kick off the festivities early thats the only piece of advice i can give ya,2
i had high hopes for this review since i really love the idea of having a rotating theme for a geek brunch unfortunately my experience fell short when it came to the crepe dish it consisted of three dry dough shells stuffed with nicely sauteed and slightly gooey walnuts accompanied by a meager dollop of whipped cream the price suggested something more extravagant but at least the home fries that came with it were chunky and crispy on the drink front the mimosa costing 6 dollars was served in a disappointingly tiny flute they should really try the neverending story mimosa which lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself was incredibly charming overflowing with cute ouija boards and meaningful symbols,2
words cannot express how extraordinary todd our bartender truly is his remarkable ability to recall my order every time provides an unforgettable experience on every visit sadly the waitresses dont seem to share the same level of excellence in their customer service therefore if you opt for the mouthwatering wings or scrumptious pizza remember to stay close to a restroom within 30 minutes as the spices take it up a notch while having stone ipa on draft is a marvelous addition expanding their selection of craft beers would undoubtedly enhance the overall enjoyment its worth noting that this establishment consistently manages to avoid being overly crowded which is another plus,2
i am not a big supporter of au bon pain overall but this specific branch is exceptionally disappointing upon entering i discovered that every employee was engrossed in their phones and shouting at each other across the store to make matters worse the entire store reeked of vomit from the moment i stepped in i managed to reach the line but the stench was so overpowering that i had to leave although i cannot comment on the quality of the products i can confidently say that i will never visit that establishment again,4
statement 2 for the first time ever my partner and i decided to try it out there were plenty of options to choose from and what caught my attention was their innovative approach towards hotdogs we picked the smoked dog and it didnt disappoint tastewise the fries were seasoned with an interesting blend of lawry salt nonetheless the price of 495 for a single hotdog did give us pause while i do acknowledge that the use of highquality ingredients justifies the cost it still felt a bit steep additionally the hotdogs werent particularly big in size so if one finds themselves famished expect to pay around 13 to 15 per individual for two hotdogs fries and a drink – which in my opinion falls on the pricier side,2
ramen bar was ok having had a lot of japanese noodle previously in different places i might have expected too much from the authentic vibe that i got from the initial look of the restaurant ni liked the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles but was very disappointed in the amount of vegetables and toppings they put on for how much i paid some of which cost extra 1 and noodle itself was 910 dollars considering chewing fresh vegetables and meat w noodle at the same time is a big part of the japanese ramen experience the restaurant does have a good atmosphere  good lighting too and decorations,3
i chose the rib eye cooked medium rare while grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato my mom ordered a salad and my stepfather opted for prime rib with a potato as well our salads arrived along with some bread but i was surprised to see that instead of splitting the salad in the kitchen they brought the salad and an extra plate in this kind of establishment considering the prices and the current economy i found it offputting but i let it go ,3
to ensure a satisfying lunch experience i decided to heed the advice of fellow yelpers and check out this place in las vegas before leaving town as it turns out their raving reviews were spot on this eatery definitely deserves recognition for its impressive sandwich selection in fact if they ever decide to open another branch in salt lake city i can guarantee you that i would become one of their regulars patronizing them at least once every week to satisfy my cravings i chose the chicken caesar wrap along with a side of comforting chicken noodle soup while i found the soup to be quite decent without any standout qualities the real star of the meal was undeniably the sandwich the dressing in particular left me captivated by its irresistible flavor even my boyfriend who ordered the club sandwich shared my sentiment about the freshness and deliciousness of our meals adding to its appeal the prices at this establishment are quite reasonable unlike many other dining options in las vegas that may empty your pockets this delightful spot offers delectable sandwiches that wont put a strain on your finances so if youre searching for a tasty and moderately priced sandwich look no further than here,0
i have a vivid memory of this place from my childhood so when we stumbled upon it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i eagerly seized the opportunity to give it a try after all what better way to embrace the vegas spirit than taking a gamble on something seemingly risky and possibly pointless like buying a clam that may or may not contain a pearl following instructions to select the fattest hairiest and ugliest clam we diligently searched for one that would truly deliver and lo and behold we struck gold we found a magnificent clam with a sizeable pink pearl inside – it was truly stunning however our excitement was quickly dampened as the woman who cracked open the clam aggressively pushed us to buy a ring setting catching us off guard before we knew it the price skyrocketed from a reasonable 15 to an outrageous 75 but hey its vegas – anything goes as she skillfully placed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving session for free this time we lucked out with a significantly larger ivory pearl tucked away in the silk pouch she provided we deemed this the perfect vegas souvenir because lets face it youre bound to spend loads of money there so at least we had something tangible to show for it plus with that added touch of vegas riskiness the ring became even more cherished preserving wonderful memories for years to come,1
this establishment has been a familiar spot for me on many occasions providing a good enough experience to warrant repeat visits in the past sadly my recent encounter here proved to be quite disappointing as i couldnt find even a single item that suited my taste despite making an effort to sample a variety of dishes my disillusionment grew to such an extent that i no longer desired to consume anything its safe to say that i wont be returning to this place again,4
familiarity with this place isnt something new to me – i have frequented it on numerous occasions in the past our previous visits were satisfactory enough to encourage us to come back however this time around i found myself disappointed as none of the items on offer appealed to my liking despite trying out different varieties i gradually lost interest in eating altogether its safe to assume that i wont be returning to this venue again,4
the customer service at this stores delibistro is terrible theres no service whatsoever ive been here multiple times because i work nearby and every time im helped just as im about to leave emptyhanded due to the long wait and being ignored the first awful experience was during breakfast when i finally got help i ordered a number 1 from the menu board the employee asked me what i wanted in it even though the sign should have had all the information she didnt know or see the sign so she told me to just tell her what i want i chose a few items i saw in the hot case but she charged extra for biscuits and gravy youd think if she knew those werent included in a number 1 she would have known what was as she scooped my food she openly complained to a coworker about how nobody buys breakfast it goes to waste and thats not something you want to hear when buying breakfast yourself when i got to work with my breakfast i found out she was right the potatoes were overcooked and dry biscuits and gravy tasted disgusting and the eggs were crusty dry and old,4
being a handson person when it comes to cars i do most of the repairs myself however there are a few tasks that i prefer to leave in the capable hands of a professional mechanic luckily honda produces exceptionally comprehensive service manuals that offer stepbystep guidance on performing virtually any maintenance or repair job including intricate procedures like complete engine removal nevertheless i often encounter steps in the manual that require special tools or skills beyond my comfort level this is when i turn to the trusted services of honmannnservice their competence and reliability have been proven time and again despite the slightly dim office ambiance their waiting area manages to provide adequate comfort while waiting for your vehicle,0
joyride was more like a 10 car pile up no flavor meh,4
as one would anticipate from a wellestablished chain restaurant youll be served ample portions here albeit with disappointing food quality however families with children seem to enjoy it and the overall ambiance isnt too shabby but if you possess even the slightest inkling for refined cuisine i strongly recommend bypassing this establishment altogether instead seek out a localowned restaurant where you can truly relish your dining experience to illustrate when i ordered the chicken and biscuits it arrived at my table in a haphazard pile resembling a meal that had taken an unnecessary joyride around the neighborhood with the pizza delivery guy is there really anything else i need to emphasize,3
statement 1 we decided to give it a go with my spouse and there were countless choices available i appreciate the unique twist they bring to hotdogs our choice was the smoked dog which turned out to be delicious the fries were seasoned with some flavorful lawry salt however the price of 495 for a hotdog came as a surprise although i understand that the topnotch ingredients justify the cost it does make you hesitate moreover the size of the hotdogs isnt very large so if youre feeling hungry youll end up spending at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverage making it appear somewhat expensive to me,2
the cap centers location is convenient and they have a good selection of products available although their prices are not the best and their produce is average i find it beneficial that they provide a complimentary item when you spend 20 taking advantage of the moocho deal they offered last year saved me a significant amount of money and occasionally i come across valuable items in their discounted food area when on campus this store is a dependable option for purchasing groceries,2
cap centre situated in a convenient location offers a satisfactory variety of products although their prices may not be the most competitive and their produce falls within the average range their inclusion of a complimentary item with a 20 expenditure is appealing the moocho deal from last year proved to be costsaving and occasionally one may stumble upon surprising finds in their discounted food section for those located on campus this store serves as a dependable choice for grocery shopping,2
im not a religious person but this church is simply amazing and beautiful  the building is in old montreal where it is historic  nnthis is a must see in montreal,0
my family and i used to enjoy visiting luv it for custard on weekends we had a great time there especially because my parents used to go when they were teenagers and now they took us it was always an amazing experience until last night something felt different when i approached the counter to order and noticed that none of the familiar friendly faces were there i ordered a western with extra cherries but was very disappointed when an asian woman handed me my custard and it wasnt what i asked for the service was terrifying and the staff gave me hostile glares after i returned the custard to make matters worse they wanted to charge me an additional 85 cents for just one cherry i asked her to correct my order because it didnt match the quality i had experienced over the past 30 years they should learn some english and listen to their customers orders charging accordingly from the beginning needless to say i wont be returning,4
while i held onto great anticipation for this review it unfortunately didnt meet my expectations regardless my dedication to supporting the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch remains unwavering the crepe dish i ordered was far from exceptional consisting of three dry dough shells enclosing nicely sautéed walnuts that were slightly gooey to my disappointment only a small dollop of whipped cream was provided to be shared between the shells moreover i felt that the price i paid didnt match the level of creativity i anticipated on a positive note the home fries served alongside were enjoyable boasting a satisfying chunkiness and crispness as for the mimosa it cost me six dollars and arrived in a miniature flute leaving something to be desired personally i suggest trying the neverending story mimosa which truly lives up to its name however its worth mentioning that the atmosphere of the place itself was incredibly cute enriched with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
while i may not identify as religious i cannot emphasize enough how incredibly impressive and aesthetically pleasing this church is its location in the historically rich neighborhood of old montreal only adds to its allure making it an absolute mustsee attraction when youre in town,0
when it comes to a restaurant of such immense magnitude the overwhelming taste and stunning atmosphere cannot be adequately prepared for and my review will accurately capture my speechless state of mind after enjoying the meal,0
it is just as anticipated from a major franchise eatery generous servings and subpar food quality children enjoy it and the atmosphere is decent if you have any inclination towards fine dining i would advise against visiting this place instead opt for a locally owned establishment to relish your dining experience when i ordered the chicken and biscuits it arrived resembling a mound of food that seemed like it had been transported by a pizza delivery driver on a joyride before reaching my table do i need to elaborate further,3
in arizona what are some eateries known for their excellent green chili pork that is both succulent and free from excess fat,1
i had dinner at this restaurant on my first night in town with my mom stepfather and grandmother upon walking in i immediately noticed that it was an upscale steakhouse but not the traditional dark boothed ambiance or the highend atmosphere of a ruth chris restaurant we were seated in a booth and our waitress who was very young and friendly told us about two specials  a veal chop and a type of fish since my grandmother loves veal chops we all encouraged her to order one the rest of the menu looked appealing and it was one of those restaurants where all the side dishes are ordered separately i chose a medium rare rib eye while grandma and i decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato mom ordered a salad while stepdad went for the prime rib and a potato as well our salads arrived along with some bread but what surprised me was that instead of tossing the salad in the kitchen they brought us the salad and another plate in this kind of establishment with these prices and considering the state of the economy i couldnt help but feel a bit put off by this but i let it go our meals arrived on very hot plates  the veal chop looked amazing and grandma wasted no time diving into it and my rib eye was also beautifully presented and quite large as it should be for 27 but it was finished off with butter something i dont particularly enjoy especially since i dont have a gallbladder additionally the rib eye had a spicy rub on it and after taking two small bites i was overwhelmed by the spiciness i really dislike such overwhelming spices in what is supposed to be a good cut of meat  seriously like something youd find at outback as for the prime rib i was told it was good but it took quite a while for the waitress to come back to our table when she finally did i pointed out that the menu did not state that the meat was seasoned or finished off with butter she agreed with me and asked if i wanted another steak at that point i was just done  i tend to get like this when im frustrated with food  so i declined her offer she apologized and then the ownerchef came over to our table and apologized for the steak as well i assured him that it was fine and he said he would remove it from the bill duh i then suggested to him that it would be a good idea to train the waitstaff to inform customers about how the steaks are prepared with the spice rub and finishing butter he explained that they are already trained to do this and that our waitress had simply forgotten to mention it oh well while i appreciate the fact that this place is not a chain restaurant and that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much i didnt appreciate the lack of service considering the price nor did i enjoy my own meal so i have to say that this place wont be on my mustvisit list the next time or any time i am in town,3
the initial excitement of the impressive costume work quickly diminishes as the poorly executed performance uninspiring set design and subpar writing take center stage it seems like i ended up attending a lackluster show with no energy,3
the joyride felt more like a collision of 10 cars lacking any taste or excitement,4
as a car enthusiast who enjoys doing things myself there are certain tasks that i prefer to leave to a professional mechanic honda provides excellent service manuals that provide detailed instructions on how to perform any imaginable task even including complete engine removal however some steps may involve the use of specialized tools or require a level of confidence that i dont yet possess this is where honmannnservice comes in  they offer great service with a slightly dim office but a comfortable waiting area,0
having already tasted japanese noodles in different places i can say that the ramen bar i visited was alright initially i had high expectations for an authentic atmosphere based on the restaurants appearance the soup bases and noodles impressed me with their clean flavors but i felt extremely dissatisfied with the inadequate amount of vegetables and toppings especially considering the hefty price tag to make matters worse some of these addons incurred extra charges in a true japanese ramen experience the act of relishing fresh vegetables and meat intertwined with the noodles holds significant importance and unfortunately it was lacking in this regard nevertheless the restaurant did manage to create a pleasant environment with welllit spaces and tasteful decorations,3
for our first attempt my partner and i delved into a plethora of alternatives and what captivated my interest was their unconventional take on hotdogs the smoked dog we ordered provided a delectable experience accompanied by fries infused with an intriguing lawry salt seasoning nonetheless the price tag of 495 for just one hotdog urges one to pause momentarily granted this expense could be justified by the usage of premiumquality ingredients but its worth noting that the hotdogs themselves are not substantial in size consequently if you arrive with a hearty appetite be prepared to shell out at least 13 to 15 per individual for two hotdogs fries and a drink which from my perspective may seem slightly pricey,2
when i visited the oldfashioned establishment during brunch time on a sunday it was quite crowded although my group was in a rush the wait for our meals felt lengthy however if we didnt have a time constraint it would have been acceptable the menu at this place was appealing featuring numerous fascinating wisconsin specialties like cheese plates this combination of slightly upscale yet laidback wisconsin ambiance affordable prices and tasty food contributed to a positive experience overall although i wasnt particularly fond of my grilled vegetable sandwich because i hadnt realized it had an olive spread and since im not a big fan of olives the sandwich failed to impress me nevertheless the vegetables were wellgrilled and the fries were outstanding so i cant complain,1
the individuals exhibited great kindness and the cuisine was quite satisfactory i opted for a chicagostyle hot dog in addition to a cheeseburger the former was acceptable and i would consider ordering it again however contrary to popular opinion that their burger was awardwinning i found the patty reminiscent of generic frozen patties available at grocery stores—not as fresh and succulent compared to other acclaimed burgers i have savored elsewhere on a positive note my companion highly praised their polish sausage i intend to revisit this establishment to sample more items from their menu and hopefully revise my rating accordingly,2
upon seeing the chicken fried chicken meal brought by the waitress i genuinely thought she was pulling a prank because the portion size resembled that of a childs meal there was a scarcity of mashed potatoes and an inadequate amount of gravy on both the steak and potatoes surprisingly my 4yearold son who is normally enthusiastic about hamburgers didnt want to complete his dish due to its dryness although this critique only reflects my personal experience i feel obliged to mention that bill johnsons big apple serves significantly more generous portions on a positive note the okra and biscuits were truly exceptional,3
the people were really nice and the food was pretty good i got a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog was decent id order it again i heard they won an award for their burger so i might be in the minority here but the burger patty reminded me of those perfect circle frozen patties you might buy at the grocery store not really fresh and juicy like some of the award winning burgers ive had elsewhere my friend got a polish sausage and said it was really good nnill be back to try out some more of the menu and hopefully give em a higher rating after,2
todd the bartender is truly exceptional as he consistently recalls my preferences and offers an outstanding experience on each visit conversely the waitresses demeanor could use improvement if indulging in their wings or pizza be prepared for an urgent bathroom trip within half an hour due to the intense spices although i appreciate their offering of stone ipa on draft it would be even better if they had a wider selection of craft beers notably this establishment never seems to get overcrowded,2
love this place theyve been consistent with their product and ive been coming here since 2006 still the best one in town  price and quality thank you yama,1
my wife and i tried it for the first time lots of options and i like the fact that they have a different take on hotdogs we ordered smoked dog and it was tasty the fries had some sort of lawry salt seasoning solidnnhowever 495 for a hot makes you stop short i know youre paying for good quality ingredients but mannnthe hotdogs arent huge so if youre hungry then you will pay at least 13 to 15 a person for 2 hotdogs fries and a drink that to me is a bit pricey,2
im extremely satisfied with the service provided here after my dealer referred me to this place due to a nail in my tire i had limited time as i had to take a final exam shortly however the staff at the location promptly attended to me informing me that they would attempt to repair the tire but if unsuccessful a replacement would be necessary considering the time constraint and the fact that there were five cars waiting behind me i was anxious thankfully the technician resolved the issue swiftly sparing me the need for a tire change which i couldnt afford timewise to my delight he informed me that the service was completely complimentary exhibiting great kindness presenting exceptional customer service during such a busy period is truly admirable and im immensely grateful without a doubt i will return to this place next time i require assistance,0
the substantial delay in receiving our food was incredibly timeconsuming and frustratingly prolonged,3
this park offers a fantastic experience with amenities like a splash pad two playgrounds for children a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas additionally visitors can explore a charming cactus garden to encounter various plants and animals the park is always welllit and properly maintained just keep an eye out for cyclists  most people are considerate but there might be some reckless individuals apart from that its a wonderful park that the whole family can appreciate,1
rather than being an enjoyable adventure the joyride turned into an unappealing disaster resembling a ten car pileup leaving me feeling indifferent,4
how did it happen that i had no knowledge whatsoever about what a torta was for some reason i had this specific memory of a torta being served on an unbearably hard pitalike bread perhaps it stemmed from nightmarish experiences at taco bell but honestly im not entirely sure initially when my friend recommended tortas la presa i hesitated because i wasnt particularly fond of tortas well turns out i couldnt have been more mistaken the language barrier was eased by the staff who predominantly spoke spanish and their patience in dealing with my lack of familiarity was truly commendable fortunately there was also an abundance of visual aids on the menu which made things easier contrary to my previous misconception these tortas are actually served on soft and freshly prepared bolillo buns unfortunately i cant recall the exact name but the one i ended up devouring contained meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend went for the one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolute delights to add to the experience i indulged in perfectly sweetened horchata while catching up on the latest soccer game displayed on the generously sized tv screen its safe to say that im eagerly looking forward to returning and savoring each dish featured on the menu this place is undoubtedly phenomenal,1
how come i was unaware of what a torta was for some reason i had this recollection of a torta being served on a rockhard pitalike bread was it a bad dream about taco bell im really not certain i was quite hesitant when my friend recommended tortas la presa i thought i didnt like tortas well i was extremely mistaken the staff mostly speaks spanish and they were so accommodating in dealing with my lack of familiarity fortunately there were also plenty of pictures on the menu these tortas are served on a soft and fresh bolillo bun but i cant recall the name of the one i ordered something reyes it featured meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were incredibly tasty as i watched soccer on the large television screen i washed everything down with a perfectly sweetened horchata im eagerly anticipating going back to try each item on the menu this place is awesome,1
im a diy car guy but some things i like to take to a mechanic and let him do for me  honda writes fantastic service manuals that explain step by step how to do everything imagineable including complete engine removal but sometimes the steps involved might require a special tool or something im not confident enough to try on my own  enter honmannnservice was good  office is a bit dim but waiting area is comfortable enough,0
our meals finally arrived on very hot plates the veal chop looked gorgeous and my grandma wasted no time in digging in my rib eye was also visually appealing and came out huge as it should be for 27 however it was finished off with butter something i dont particularly like especially without a gallbladder moreover it had a spicy rub on it that overwhelmed me after just two small bites it was disappointing to experience such a flavor overpowering what was supposed to be a good cut of meat it felt like i was dining at outback steakhouse,3
i had high expectations for the review to surpass what it actually turned out to be my unwavering support for the rotating theme geek brunch persists even in the face of disappointment sadly the crepe dish i selected fell short of my hopes it consisted of three dry dough shells folded around nicely sautéed and somewhat gooey walnuts a tiny portion of whipped cream was barely enough for each shell given the price i paid i expected a bit more flair and creativity fortunately the accompanying home fries were pleasant with their substantial size and crispy texture on the other hand the mimosa i ordered cost me six dollars and came in a small flute which was underwhelming i suggest opting for a neverending story mimosa that lives up to its name nevertheless the place itself was incredibly adorable adorned with ouija boards and plenty of symbolic imagery,2
without fail todd the bartenders skills astound me his impeccable memory ensures that my visits are always enjoyable however i cant say the same about the waitresses who seem to lack courtesy at times remember if you decide to try their fiery wings or pizza be ready to make a quick dash to the restroom within half an hour since the spices hit you hard while having stone ipa on draft is fantastic i wish they boasted a more extensive selection of craft beers one positive aspect that stands out is how this place remains relatively calm and uncluttered,2
you simply cannot prepare yourself for the overwhelming taste and vision of a restaurant of this magnitude my review will reflex my state of mind after my meal speechless,0
i am extremely satisfied with the service provided here my tire had a nail in it and my dealer recommended this place despite the fact that i needed to take a final exam in just a few hours the staff quickly attended to me they assured me they would attempt to repair the tire but if unsuccessful i would need to replace it the time constraint made me anxious especially since there were five cars waiting behind me fortunately the technician fixed the tire promptly sparing me the need to change it as time was limited he informed me that all was resolved and there would be no charge his friendliness and excellent customer service were greatly appreciated particularly considering how busy they were i will definitely return here in the future if necessary,0
 yama has remained consistently excellent in their products making it my favorite place since 2006 the combination of price and quality is unbeatable and i am truly grateful,1
the initial allure of the spectacular costume work swiftly fades away as the dimly performed piece average set design and unsatisfactory writing come into focus it appears that i might have been present at a performance night lacking vitality thereby leaving me unimpressed,3
although i consider myself a doityourself person when it comes to cars there are specific tasks that i prefer leaving to a skilled mechanic the service manuals provided by honda are exceptional as they guide you through every step from basic maintenance to complete engine removal however some of these steps might necessitate specialized tools or require a higher level of confidence that i currently lack thats when honmannnservice becomes invaluable they not only provide excellent assistance but also have a comfortable waiting area despite their somewhat dim office,0
its incredible how i managed to remain completely clueless about what a torta was until recently strangely my mind had fabricated a memory of tortas being served on hardasbricks pita bread perhaps this misconception arose from unsettling encounters at taco bell in the past when my friend suggested tortas la presa as a dining option i hesitated because i firmly believed that i disliked tortas however i soon discovered that my preconceived notions couldnt have been more wrong the staff predominantly fluent in spanish went above and beyond to assist me in overcoming my lack of familiarity additionally the menu came to my aid with a generous selection of appetizing photographs to my pleasant surprise these tortas are actually served on irresistibly soft and freshly baked bolillo buns although the exact name escapes me the one i chose was referred to as something reyes and it boasted succulent meat queso fresco creamy avocado crisp lettuce and juicy tomatoes opting for a torta with mozzarella cheese my friend shared in my delight as we devoured our sandwiches both of which proved to be undeniably scrumptious while immersing ourselves in the thrilling atmosphere created by a lively soccer match playing on the big tv screen we complemented our flavorful meal with a flawlessly sweetened horchata unquestionably my anticipation for a return visit grows with each passing moment as i yearn to indulge in every delectable item on the menu this establishment truly exceeds all expectations,1
which restaurants in arizona serve tender and flavorful green chili pork that is low in fat,1
its my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town and they still seem to think they are because their behavior reflects no competition unfortunately for them there are plenty of other stores where im more than willing to drive a little extra to avoid the lousy customer service here,4
although im not particularly religious i must say that this church in the historic area of old montreal is truly stunning and captivating its definitely a sight worth seeing if youre visiting montreal,0
it appears that bashas the store used to be the only option in town perhaps they still think that way because their behavior suggests no competition unfortunately for them there are plenty of other stores i am willing to drive a little further to avoid the terrible customer service here,4
i went to the old fashioned around brunch time on a sunday and it was a bit crowded we were sort of in a hurry so the wait for our lunches seemed long but were we not in a hurry it would have been alright i liked the menu there were a lot of interesting wisconsin specialties including cheese plates which i thought was a cool mix of slightly upscale and wisconsin nice atmosphere great prices and good food i didnt love my grilled vegetable sandwich but i didnt read the menu close enough to realize it had an olive spread on it and im not a huge olive fan it was wellgrilled and the fries were terrific so no complaints overall,1
expectations are met when dining at this expansive chain establishment  think oversized portions and substandard cuisine surprisingly children seem to find it appealing and the overall vibe is not unpleasant nevertheless if you consider yourself a true enthusiast of food id suggest avoiding it altogether instead seek out an independently run local restaurant and relish the pleasure of eating out on my visit i tried their chicken and biscuits which arrived as a chaotic mound of food resembling the aftermath of a pizza delivery drivers joyride before finally making its way to my table do i really need to elaborate any further,3
it is impossible to fully anticipate the extraordinary flavors and visual experience that await you at a restaurant of this caliber my review will convey just how amazed and unable to speak i was after indulging in the meal,0
experience the same highquality coffee essence you get from a kcup in the comfort of your own home without breaking the bank instead of ordering a latte next time observe the method employed by baristas who rely on a machine from dillards unfortunately the outcome might result in unsatisfactory pastries but exceptional coffee this will surely discourage any future attempts,4
the food took an unacceptably long time to arrive it was astonishingly sluggish,3
i am generally not a big fan of au bon pain but this specific location is the absolute worst when i walked in all the employees were on their phones and shouting to each other across the store even worse the entire store reeked of vomit from the moment i entered i managed to make it to the line but had to leave because the smell was so overpowering i cant comment on the quality of their products but one things for sure — i will never set foot in there again,4
instead of being an exciting and flavorful experience the joyride resembled a chaotic pileup involving multiple vehicles leaving me feeling unenthusiastic,4
when the waitress brought my chicken fried chicken meal it seemed like a small portion with not enough mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes my 4yearold son usually loves hamburgers but he found it too dry to finish im only commenting on what i ordered but bill johnsons big apple portions are far superior however the okra and biscuits were excellent,3
on a sunday morning i decided to dine at the oldfashioned eatery and unsurprisingly it was packed since my companions and i were somewhat in a rush the wait for our meals felt longer than desired however i believe that had we been more relaxed the waiting time wouldnt have been as bothersome one aspect of this place that caught my attention was the menu which showcased an array of intriguing wisconsin specialties including cheese plates—a delightful blend of slight refinement and authentic wisconsin flair with its welcoming atmosphere budgetfriendly prices and satisfying cuisine i generally had a positive experience although i wasnt particularly thrilled with my choice of a grilled vegetable sandwich due to the unexpected olive spread which i failed to notice on the menu being someone who isnt fond of olives the sandwich didnt resonate with me nonetheless the vegetables were wonderfully grilled and the fries were absolutely fantastic compensating for any minor grievances i had,1

hey guess what cowboy this is a huge concert venue why are you reading reviews  you know that even at their best they are always middle of the road and you dont have an optionnnpro  they get major acts to perform on a regular basis the staff is generally not a bunch of jerks and while pavilion rd is a testament to poor city planning traffic is not smdhv horrible just smh horrible  parking is free so thats what goes into all those ticketmaster fees thanks corporate americanncon  1100 is not an appropriate price for a deucedeuce of coors light  food is not horrible unless you get a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville  population cracked tooth  tickets are not cheap and by not cheap i generally mean expensive for seats middle of the road for lawn  as with any public place lavatorial facilities are quick to be disgusting  for me the university area is the middle of friggin nowhere and it is not too convenient to get to and fronnbut like i said you dont have a choice  so there is really no debating it bring beers keep an ice cold cooler by your car and pregame  thats the only suggestion i have for ya,2
the excitement generated by the exceptional costume work quickly diminishes as the performance unfolds with uninspiring stage design and underwhelming writing perhaps i stumbled upon a lackluster night but thats my takeaway from the experience,3
the park is amazing providing a splash pad two playgrounds for children a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas visitors can also enjoy a delightful cactus garden where they can observe various plants and animals the park is always wellmaintained and illuminated its important to be cautious of cyclists while at the park as most are considerate but some may ride recklessly overall this park is a wonderful place for families to have a great time,1
can you recommend a location in arizona where i can savor tender mouthwatering green chili pork with no added fat,1
i dont particularly enjoy au bon pain in general and this particular one is by far the worst when i walked in i noticed that all the employees were on their phones and yelling at each other throughout the store furthermore the smell of vomit permeated the entire place starting from the entrance although i made it to the queue the overwhelming pungency of the odor forced me to turn around and leave while i cant vouch for the quality of the food i have no intention of ever going back there,4
i appreciate the fact that this restaurant is not part of a chain and that my grandmother thoroughly enjoyed her meal however i didnt appreciate the lack of service considering the prices nor did i enjoy my own meal therefore i have to say that this place wont be on my list of mustvisit restaurants next time or any time im in town,3
the ramen bar was decent especially since ive had a lot of japanese noodles before in various locations however i may have set my expectations too high based on the authentic vibe initially conveyed by the restaurants appearance although i enjoyed the clean flavors of their soup bases and noodles i was thoroughly disappointed with the scant amount of vegetables and toppings they provided given the high price point some of which even required an additional cost considering that chewing fresh vegetables and meat together with the noodles is a fundamental aspect of the japanese ramen experience this aspect left much to be desired nevertheless the restaurant did excel in creating a pleasant atmosphere with good lighting and tasteful decorations,3
how did i not know what a torta was for some reason i had this memory of a torta being served on brick hard pita type breadwas it nightmares of taco bell im really not sure i was quite hesitant when my friend suggested tortas la presa i dont like tortas i thought well i was very very wrong the staff speaks mainly spanish and they were so helpful when addressing my gringaness lucky for me there were also a lot of pictures on the menunnthese tortas here are served on a soft fresh bolillo bun i cant remember the name of the one i had but it was something reyes it had carne and queso fresco with avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend had one with mozzarella cheese both were absolutely delicious i watched soccer on the big tv and washed my down with a perfectly sweetened horchata i cant wait to go back and try every one on the menuthis place rocks,1

being someone who loves working on cars on my own i still choose to outsource certain tasks to a competent mechanic one thing worth mentioning is that honda has created exceptional service manuals that outline the entire process starting from basic repairs and going all the way up to completely removing the engine however in some instances certain steps may demand special tools or a level of expertise beyond my comfort zone when confronted with such situations i rely on honmannnservice which offers goodquality assistance although their office lighting might be a bit dim the waiting area is reasonably comfortable,0
despite my lack of religious beliefs i am truly in awe of the incredible aesthetics of this magnificent church situated in the historic district of old montreal its unparalleled beauty combined with its rich heritage makes it an indispensable tourist spot that should not be missed when visiting montreal,0
the initial thrill of the impressive costume work diminishes rapidly leaving behind a lackluster performance with subpar set design and mediocre writing it feels like i ended up attending a lowenergy show but thats how it turned out for me,3
when the waitress served my chicken fried chicken meal i initially believed she was joking because it seemed like a small portion with insufficient mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak or potatoes despite my 4yearold son generally enjoying hamburgers he didnt want to eat his due to its dryness while i am only commenting on my own order i have found that bill johnsons big apple offers larger portions that are more satisfying however i must mention that the okra and biscuits were excellent,3
original phrase the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle was to die for really everything on that dish meshed well together a must trynnthe appetizer which is the sea urchin on top of beef gelatin covered in pea soup was really boring i just didnt get the concept you want the uni to shine but all that other gelatin and pea soup just covered the flavor not complement it there was also a texture issue its like youre eating a mouthful of savory jello which was not to my liking there should just be something to chew in that sort of dish otherwise i feel like im eating pureed baby food other than that this place is great small portions over priced but tasty,0
im not particularly fond of au bon pain as a whole but this particular branch is the most terrible upon entering i noticed every employee engrossed in their phones shouting at each other from one end of the store to the other whats worse the pungent stench of vomit filled the entire store from the moment i stepped through the door although i attempted to wait in line i had to abruptly turn around due to the overpowering odor while i cannot form an opinion on their offerings i can confidently say that i will never return to that place again,4
the initial fascination with the remarkable costume work rapidly subsides as the underwhelming execution mediocre set design and weak writing become evident perhaps i unintentionally attended a lackluster evening performance which left me unenthusiastic,3
for some reason i was unaware of what a torta was until now strangely i had a distorted memory of tortas being served on brickhard pita bread maybe it stemmed from bad experiences at taco bell initially when my friend suggested trying tortas la presa i hesitated because i believed i didnt like tortas however i soon discovered that my judgment was completely mistaken the predominantly spanishspeaking staff was incredibly helpful in accommodating my lack of knowledge as an added bonus the menu included numerous appetizing pictures contrary to my initial misconception these tortas are actually served on soft and freshly baked bolillo buns although i cant recall the specific name the one i tried was called something reyes and it consisted of tender meat queso fresco creamy avocado refreshing lettuce and juicy tomatoes my friend decided to go for a torta with mozzarella cheese which turned out to be equally delightful both sandwiches were truly mouthwatering accompanied by the excitement of watching soccer on their large tv screen i quenched my thirst with a perfectly sweetened horchata needless to say i am eager to return and explore every option on the menu this place is absolutely fantastic,1
todd the bartender is amazing  he remembers my order and provides for a great experience every time  the waitresses are rude otherwise  if you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch  love the fact thaf they got stone ipa on draft but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection  this place is never crowded,2
im not sure why i never knew what a torta was but i had this strange memory of it being served on hard pitalike bread maybe it was nightmares from taco bell when my friend suggested going to tortas la presa i was hesitant because i didnt think i liked tortas boy was i wrong the staff who mainly spoke spanish were so helpful with my unfamiliarity luckily there were plenty of pictures on the menu these tortas are actually served on soft and fresh bolillo buns i cant recall the name of the one i had but it was something reyes it had meat queso fresco avocado lettuce and tomatoes my friend opted for one with mozzarella cheese both sandwiches were absolutely delicious while watching soccer on the big tv i washed it all down with a perfectly sweetened horchata i cant wait to go back and try everything on the menu this place is amazing,1

the customer service at this stores delibistro is extremely poor with nonexistent assistance i have visited multiple times due to my proximity to work but each time i am only assisted when i am just about to leave emptyhanded after being ignored for a long time the first terrible experience was during breakfast where i finally received help but when i ordered a number 1 from the sign the employee claimed not to know what it contained and asked me to specify instead i chose a few items i saw in the hot case but then she charged extra for biscuits and gravy even though they didnt come with a number 1 as she prepared my food she casually complained to a coworker about how breakfast wasnt popular anymore and how they had to throw away unsold items this definitely did not inspire confidence in the quality of my meal and my suspicions were confirmed when i got to work and found the potatoes overcooked and dry the biscuits and gravy unappetizing and the eggs crusty and old,4
an excellent park awaits you equipped with exciting features such as a splash pad two playgrounds for kids a basketball court and multiple shaded eating areas for entertainment moreover there is a delightful little cactus garden where visitors can admire diverse flora and fauna the parks maintenance and illumination are impeccable though cyclists frequent the area the majority are courteous however a few may speed through like lance armstrong aside from that this park assures an enjoyable experience suitable for the entire family,1
im a selfprofessed diy enthusiast when it comes to working on cars but there are certain things that i prefer having a skilled mechanic handle hondas superbly written service manuals take you through each and every procedure imaginable even detailing the intricacies of completely removing an engine however some of the outlined steps may call for specialized tools or techniques that i lack confidence in executing alone thats where honmannnservice enters the picture – they deliver exceptional assistance although their office might benefit from brighter lighting the waiting area offers sufficient comfort during the wait,0
although i dont have a strong liking for au bon pain overall this specific establishment takes the crown for being the absolute worst as soon as i entered i witnessed every single employee occupied with their phones loudly communicating with each other across the store to compound matters the nauseating smell of vomit permeated the entire store right from the entrance despite my attempt to withstand the scent and stand in line i couldnt endure it any longer and had to abandon my plans while i cannot provide feedback on the quality of their products i firmly resolve to never step foot in that place ever again,4
the taste and ambience of a restaurant of this caliber are beyond any preparation and my review will accurately reflect the speechless state of mind i experienced after my meal,0
i am very pleased by the level of service i received at this establishment after being advised by my dealer i decided to come here when i discovered a nail in my tire given that i had an impending final exam within a few hours i was quite anxious about the situation however the staff efficiently attended to me assuring that repairs would be attempted and replacement considered if necessary in addition to the time constraint there were also five cars waiting behind me making the situation more stressful thankfully the technician resolved the issue swiftly eliminating the need for a tire change due to lack of time to my delight the technician informed me that there was no charge for the service and he displayed exceptional kindness throughout the process i am truly grateful for individuals who deliver outstanding service even amidst high demand and i will undoubtedly return here should the need arise again,0
the chicken fried chicken meal that the waitress brought looked more like a childs portion with insufficient mashed potatoes and gravy on the steak and potatoes although my 4yearold son usually enjoys hamburgers he refused to finish his meal due to its dryness while i can only speak for what i ordered i must say that bill johnsons big apple provides much larger portions on the bright side the okra and biscuits were absolutely delicious,3
it’s remarkable how todd the bartender always impresses me with his ability to remember my order ensuring a delightful experience every time i patronize the place on the downside the waitresses tend to be impolite for those opting for their spicy wings or pizza ensure you have easy access to a restroom within 30 minutes of consumption as the flavors pack quite a punch while i love that they have stone ipa available on tap it would be even better if they expanded their range of craft beer choices the fact that this venue is rarely crowded adds to its appeal,2
hey cowboy did you know this concert venue is pretty big so why are you bothering to read reviews when you already know theyre always just average plus you dont have any other options anyway since they consistently book top acts the staff isnt terrible either and while the road leading to the pavilion could have been planned better the traffic isnt terribly horrendous  just a bit annoying on the bright side at least parking is free which explains those pricey ticketmaster fees thanks to corporate america by the way 1100 for a 24pack of coors light is ridiculous the food isnt terrible either unless you happen to grab a fresh hot pretzel welcome to crownville population cracked tooth the tickets arent cheap either i mean expensive for good seats but only average for lawn seating and like any public place the restrooms tend to be gross fairly quickly personally i find the university area to be in the middle of nowhere and not very convenient to get to but hey as i mentioned earlier you dont really have a choice so theres no point in arguing about it just bring some beers keep an icecold cooler by your car and pregame  thats my only suggestion for you,2
on our inaugural occasion my better half and i ventured to explore an abundance of options and what piqued my curiosity was their innovative twist on hotdogs the smoked dog we opted for delivered a delightful flavor profile enhanced further by fries seasoned with a captivating blend of lawry salt however the hefty price of 495 for a solitary hotdog does make one stop in their tracks admittedly the utilization of highquality ingredients can account for this expense but its important to note that the hotdogs themselves are not overly substantial consequently if you find yourself famished be prepared to allocate at least 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a beverage which personally strikes me as moderately expensive,2
notably the individuals present demonstrated remarkable amiability and the dishes served had a rather pleasant taste i decided to try a chicagostyle hot dog along with a cheeseburger the former was satisfactory enough that i would contemplate having it once more however despite popular claims of the burger being awarded for its excellence i personally found the patty reminiscent of those perfect circle frozen patties commonly purchased at grocery stores—lacking the freshness and succulence characteristic of some other highly regarded burgers i have experienced elsewhere interestingly enough my companion ordered a polish sausage and attested to its exceptional quality as a result i aim to return to this establishment to explore further options from their menu hopefully leading to an improved rating on my part,2
as anticipated this large chain restaurant offers enormous servings and below par culinary standards nonetheless it seems to appeal to kids and exudes a somewhat pleasant ambiance however if you pride yourself on being a connoisseur id advise against visiting explore an independently operated restaurant in your area for a more enjoyable dining experience i opted for the chicken and biscuits which were presented as a jumbled pile of food that resembled a pizza delivery guys detour before being served at my table is there anything more to add,3
this large chain restaurant lives up to expectations with its sizable portions and belowaverage culinary standards despite the appeal it holds for kids and the ambiance being reasonable if you consider yourself a true food enthusiast steer clear of this place seek out a locally run eatery where you can truly savor your diningout experience i opted for the chicken and biscuits dish but what arrived at my table resembled a heap of food that appeared to have taken a detour around the block in the delivery drivers vehicle before finding its way to me is there really anything more i need to say,3
the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras was absolutely delicious every element on the dish came together perfectly making it a musttry however the sea urchin appetizer which was served on top of beef gelatin and covered in pea soup left much to be desired the concept behind it was unclear as the gelatin and soup seemed to overpower the delicate flavor of the uni additionally the texture was offputting resembling savory jello personally i prefer dishes that have something to chew on rather than pureed baby foodlike consistency despite this setback the overall dining experience at this place is great albeit with small portions and slightly high prices,0
this review didnt quite meet my expectations given my unwavering support for the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch although i anticipated something exceptional the crepe dish turned out to be a letdown essentially it comprised of three dry dough shells enclosing wellcooked yet slightly gooey walnuts complemented by a minuscule dollop of whipped cream considering the hefty price i hoped for a touch more sophistication thankfully the accompanying home fries proved enjoyable due to their substantial chunks and crispiness regrettably the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a petite flute failed to impress it might be worth suggesting they introduce the neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nonetheless the space itself exuded undeniable adorableness overflowing with ouija boards and an abundance of symbolic imagery,2
the ramen bar was decent but my expectations were higher due to previous experiences with japanese noodle dishes i appreciated the delicious flavors of their soup bases and noodles but i was disappointed by the meager amount of vegetables and toppings considering the price especially since some of them required an additional fee the noodles alone cost 910 and it would have been nice to enjoy a combination of fresh vegetables and meat with my noodles as that is a significant aspect of the authentic japanese ramen experience nonetheless the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere with good lighting and attractive decorations,3
after experiencing japanese noodles from different places the ramen bar i tried was satisfactory initially the restaurant seemed to exude an authentic vibe making me expect a lot while the taste of their soups and noodles was pleasantly clean i ended up feeling let down when it came to the quantity of vegetables and toppings they served especially considering the price some extras were charged which only added to the disappointment additionally at a whopping cost of 910 per noodle i missed the essential experience of combining fresh vegetables and meat while enjoying the japanese ramen nonetheless the establishment succeeded in providing a great ambiance with welllit spaces and attractive decor,3
yama has been my goto place since 2006 and their product consistency always impresses me the combination of affordable prices and high quality makes it the best one in town thank you yama for providing such a great experience,1

the freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle was to die for really everything on that dish meshed well together a must trynnthe appetizer which is the sea urchin on top of beef gelatin covered in pea soup was really boring i just didnt get the concept you want the uni to shine but all that other gelatin and pea soup just covered the flavor not complement it there was also a texture issue its like youre eating a mouthful of savory jello which was not to my liking there should just be something to chew in that sort of dish otherwise i feel like im eating pureed baby food other than that this place is great small portions over priced but tasty,0
the cap center has a convenient location and offers a decent variety of products while their prices are not the most competitive and their produce is average i appreciate their offer of a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they had last year helped me save a lot and their reduced price food section sometimes contains hidden gems if youre on campus this is a reliable place to shop for groceries,2
instead of a thrilling experience the joyride felt more like a chaotic mess involving ten vehicles and lacking any excitement or satisfaction,4

i visited an oldfashioned establishment for brunch on a sunday and it was quite packed we were feeling rushed so the waiting time for our lunches felt lengthy however if we werent in a hurry it would have been fine i enjoyed the extensive menu that featured many interesting wisconsin specialties such as cheese platters it had a cool blend of sophistication and a friendly wisconsin atmosphere offering great prices and delicious food although i didnt particularly enjoy my grilled vegetable sandwich because i overlooked the fact that it had an olive spread and im not a big fan of olives it was wellgrilled and the fries were fantastic overall no major complaints,1

even though i dont consider myself a religious individual i cant help but be thoroughly impressed by the beauty and grandeur of this church located in the historic district of old montreal its an absolute mustvisit spot for anyone exploring the city,0
with its conveniently situated location the cap center offers a satisfactory range of products however their prices may not be the most competitive and their produce generally falls into the average category nonetheless i am pleased that they give customers a free item after spending 20 last years moocho deal secured me considerable savings and every now and then i discover some real treasures in their discounted food section if you happen to be on campus this grocery store provides a reliable source for your shopping needs,2
the patrons were incredibly friendly and the quality of the food was notably good my selection comprised a chicago dog and a cheeseburger while the chicago dog met my expectations leading me to potentially order it again i seem to be among the minority who did not find the burger patty exceptional even though it supposedly won an award it reminded me more of the perfectly circular frozen patties readily available at grocery stores lacking the freshness and juiciness characteristic of other awardwinning burgers ive enjoyed elsewhere interestingly my friends choice of a polish sausage proved to be truly delectable consequently i plan to return to this establishment in order to sample additional items from their menu with the hope of adjusting my rating upwardly,2
save money and enjoy the same highquality coffee you would get from a pricey latte by brewing your own kcup at home if youre curious about how cafes make their lattes observe their use of machines sourced from dillards unfortunately their end result might have subpar coffee but excellent pastries lesson learned never go back,4
this place offers a truly delightful dish of freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its flavors blend harmoniously making it an absolute musttry on the other hand the sea urchin appetizer served atop beef gelatin and pea soup disappoints the concept behind it is confusing as the gelatin and soup seem to mask rather than enhance the outstanding flavor of the uni furthermore its texture resembles that of savory jello which isnt to my taste in my opinion such a dish should contain more substance to chew on instead of feeling like pureed baby food nevertheless despite these concerns this place excels overall offering great dining experiences with smaller portions but tasty dishes that come at a slightly higher price point,0
my visit to the oldfashioned spot coincided with sunday brunch which resulted in a significant crowd as my friends and i were in a hurry the wait for our lunches seemed longer than expected had we not been pressed for time the delay wouldnt have bothered us what i found appealing was their extensive menu specializing in diverse wisconsin dishes like cheese plates combining an element of sophistication with a warm wisconsin atmosphere reasonable prices and delicious food this place left a generally positive impression while my experience was a bit underwhelming due to my grilled vegetable sandwich unexpectedly having an olive spread—i never noticed it on the menu—i should have paid closer attention as i dont particularly enjoy olives nevertheless the vegetables were expertly grilled and the fries were exceptional making up for any disappointments,1
im not a huge fan of au bon pain in general but this one in particular is the worst i walked in to find every employee on their phone yelling across the store to eachother worse yet the entire store from the door way smelled of vomit i made it to the line but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent i cannot speak to the product but i can say i would never go in there again,4
although im not particularly religious i find this church in old montreal to be absolutely stunning and captivating its historical significance adds to its beauty and makes it a mustvisit attraction in the city,0
while i dont consider myself religious i am amazed by the sheer beauty of this exceptional church located in old montreal its historical importance further enhances its allure making it an absolute mustsee destination while in montreal,0
our patience was tested as we endured an unnecessarily lengthy wait for our meal which was extremely slow in being served,3
statement 3 taking the plunge for the first time my wife and i decided to sample it the variety of choices available impressed us and i found their distinct take on hotdogs quite appealing opting for the smoked dog turned out to be a wise decision as it had an enjoyable flavor the fries were equally delightful with their lawry salt seasoning however the cost of 495 per hotdog caught us off guard even though we acknowledged that the ingredients used were of exceptional quality furthermore considering that the hotdogs werent generously sized those with a hearty appetite would need to shell out a minimum of 13 to 15 per person for two hotdogs fries and a drink – something i personally find a tad expensive,2
im very pleased by the service here i had a nail in my tire and my dealer recommended me to come here i had to take a final in just a few hours the people there took care of me pretty quickly they told me theyll try to fix it if not ill have to change a new tire i was very worried about the time also the place was very busy therere 5 cars waiting behind me the guy fixed it really quick and i was glad i didnt need to change tire because i did not have enough time he came and told me it was all set and its all free he was super nice and i really appreciate people delivering great service when theyre really busy ill definitely come back here next time if i need to,0
great park with a lot to offer a splash pad  2 playgrounds for the kids a basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas to entertain with a quaint little cactus garden to see plants  animals the park is always well lit and maintained watch out for folks on their bikes most people are considerate but some can be douchebags who race through the park like theyre lance armstrong other than that this is a great park the whole family can enjoy,1
this is not my first visit to this establishment ive been here multiple times before previously the experience was enjoyable enough to warrant our return nonetheless during this recent visit i struggled to find any dish that suited my preferences i attempted numerous alternatives but eventually reached a stage where i had no appetite left it is safe to say that i wont be coming back here,4
my family and i used to enjoy visiting luv it for their delicious custard on the weekends we had always thought it was a great place as my parents had also frequented it during their teenage years it was always an amazing experience until yesterday when something felt off when i approached the counter to order i noticed that there were no familiar friendly faces i ordered a western with extra cherries but to my disappointment an asian woman handed me a different custard the service was intimidating and the staff glared at me when i returned the incorrect order to make matters worse they wanted to charge me an extra 85 cents for just one cherry i requested them to correct my order as it didnt match up with the past 30 years of going there it would be appreciated if they learned some english and listened to their customers orders from the start needless to say i will not be returning,4
ive been here many times before and it was good enough for us to come back however this time i couldnt find any single item that i liked i tried many different things until i dont want to eat any more wont be coming back again for sure,4
we experienced an exasperatingly delayed service causing us to wait an unnecessarily extended period for our food,3
the individuals present at this establishment were incredibly kindhearted and the meals they served were relatively satisfying for my order i selected a chicago dog and a cheeseburger the chicago dog had a decent taste prompting me to potentially order it again however it is worth noting that i might hold a different viewpoint compared to others since the burger patty reminded me of the preformed frozen patties commonly available at grocery stores rather than portraying the freshness and juiciness typically associated with awardwinning burgers ive savored elsewhere meanwhile my acquaintance opted for a polish sausage and expressed great satisfaction with its flavors with the intention of further exploring their menu i plan on returning to this place and hopefully assigning them a higher rating,2
get ready to indulge in the exquisite taste of premium coffee at a fraction of the price with the convenience of a kcup right in your own kitchen take a moment to scrutinize the technique utilized by dillards baristas when preparing their lattes though the overall outcome may be disappointing for pastries enthusiasts and delightful for coffee lovers never again will you risk having those subpar pastries,4
indulge in the exquisite freerange quail stuffed with foie gras its an absolute gastronomic delight all components within this dish complement each other flawlessly creating an irresistible combination that you simply mustnt miss conversely the sea urchin appetizer fails to impress placed upon a bed of beef gelatin immersed in pea soup the overall concept remains ambiguous the overpowering presence of gelatin and soup hinders rather than enhances the delicate taste of the uni additionally the texture resembles that of savory jello which personally doesnt appeal to me i believe a dish like this should offer a more substantial chewiness instead of resembling pureed baby food however despite these drawbacks this restaurant provides an overall fantastic dining experience although the portions may be smaller and the prices slightly higher the flavors are undeniably tasty,0
you definitely have to try the amazing freerange quail stuffed with foie gras calle at this restaurant  its incredible everything on the plate comes together so perfectly creating a truly memorable experience on the other hand i was quite disappointed by the sea urchin appetizer topped with beef gelatin and pea soup it felt rather dull and failed to showcase the unis full potential in fact the gelatin and pea soup seemed to mask the unis flavor instead of enhancing it apart from overshadowing the taste the dish also suffered from a texture issue  it was reminiscent of eating savory jello which personally wasnt enjoyable ideally there should have been some element that provided a satisfying chewiness to balance out the softer components nevertheless despite these flaws i must say this place is still amazing overall even though the portions are quite small and the prices slightly high,0
it is impossible to anticipate the extraordinary flavors and visual splendor that await you at this exceptional restaurant my review will convey the overwhelming impact it had on me leaving me lost for words,0
 i have developed a deep affection for this place as they have consistently delivered exceptional products throughout the years since 2006 yama remains unparalleled in terms of both affordability and excellence i extend my heartfelt thanks to them,1
considering my prior experience with japanese noodle cuisine from other places i found the ramen bar to be average although i initially had high hopes for an authentic vibe based on its appearance the actual dining experience fell short on the positive side i did appreciate the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles however i felt let down by the skimpy portions of vegetables and toppings considering the prices charged especially when certain ingredients came at an additional cost it was disheartening to see that the noodles alone cost a whopping 910 lacking the essential element of chewing fresh vegetables and meat along with them—a crucial aspect of true japanese ramen enjoyment despite these drawbacks the restaurant did offer an inviting atmosphere with welllit spaces and tasteful decorations,3
before departing from vegas i made a point of sampling the cuisine at this locale for lunch due to numerous glowing recommendations from the yelp community as it turns out these recommendations were indeed on point i can confidently state that this place is an absolute gem when it comes to sandwich creation if they ever decide to expand their operations to salt lake city count me in as a regular customer who will frequent the establishment no less than once per week my selection for lunch consisted of the chicken caesar wrap accompanied by a serving of chicken noodle soup while the soup was flavorful but unremarkable the sandwich itself was a revelation i remain baffled by the secret goodness embedded within the dressing its addictive qualities reminded me of illicit substances in sync with my own experience my boyfriend also relished his club sandwich and wholeheartedly agreed with me regarding the freshness and taste professed by this eatery moreover the prices here are quite reasonable definitely falling on the more affordable side when compared to other dining options in vegas so if you are craving a lipsmacking yet reasonablypriced sandwich look no further than this incredible spot,0
the joyride lacked any excitement resembling a massive collision of ten cars with no enjoyable taste,4
on a sunday during brunch hours i decided to grab a bite at the nostalgic place but unfortunately it was quite congested since i was in a bit of a rush the wait time for our lunches seemed longer than usual however if we hadnt been pressed for time the experience would have been satisfactory the diverse menu caught my attention with its variety of intriguing wisconsin specialties specifically the cheese plates this combination of slight elegance and wisconsin hospitality created a pleasant atmosphere complemented by reasonable prices and tasty food despite not fully enjoying my grilled vegetable sandwich due to its surprising olive spread as i failed to carefully read the menu the sandwich itself was cooked well accompanied by outstanding fries thus overall there were no significant grievances,1
the initial allure of the outstanding costumes quickly fades away when confronted with a poorly executed production featuring mediocre set design and weak scriptwriting it seems like i happened to catch a performance with low energy but thats the impression it left me with,3
how is it possible that i remained oblivious to the concept of a torta its strange how i had this memory of a torta being served on a hardasrock pita bread maybe it was a nightmare related to taco bell but i cant be certain when my friend suggested tortas la presa i hesitated because i believed i didnt like tortas boy was i wrong the majority of the staff spoke spanish and they were incredibly helpful in addressing my lack of understanding luckily the menu had numerous pictures to assist me unlike what i previously imagined these tortas are served on a soft and freshly made bolillo bun although i cant recall the exact name the one i tried had carne and queso fresco accompanied by avocado lettuce and tomatoes meanwhile my friend opted for one with mozzarella cheese let me tell you both were absolutely delicious as i enjoyed watching soccer on the large tv screen i also relished a perfectly sweetened horchata i can hardly wait to return and sample every item from the menu this place is incredible,1
initially i thought the waitress was joking when she served me the chicken fried chicken meal as it appeared to be quite small lacking in mashed potatoes and gravy on both the steak and potatoes surprisingly even my 4yearold hamburgerloving son couldnt finish his meal because it was excessively dry please note that i am solely discussing my own order here but in comparison the portions at bill johnsons big apple are significantly better nevertheless the okra and biscuits were truly marvelous,3
cap centre is conveniently located and have a decent selection their prices arent the best and their produce is pretty average i like that they have a free item with a 20 purchase the moocho deal they did last year saved me a bunch and their reduced price food area sometimes hold treasuresnnif youre on campus this is a solid place to buy groceries,2
 ever since 2006 i have been a loyal customer of this outstanding establishment called yama their unwavering commitment to delivering topnotch products at affordable prices has made them the best in town i cannot express enough gratitude towards them,1
i have visited this place several times in the past and it was satisfactory enough for me and my companions to return however on this particular occasion i couldnt find a single item that appealed to my taste despite trying various options i reached a point where i no longer desired to eat i am certain that i will not be revisiting this venue again,4
the food took an unreasonably long time to arrive resulting in a frustratingly slow dining experience,3
i wanted this review to be better for sure because i will support the idea of a rotatingtheme geek brunch to my dying daybut my crepe dish that was literally three dry dough shells folded around some nicelysauteedandslightlygooey walnuts with a teeny dollop of whipped cream to split between themand cost me a price that suggested a bit more flair the home fries it came with were nice and chunky and crispy the mimosa was 6 and served in a tiny flute i suggest the neverending story mimosa which never ends hey hey  really super adorable space though with ouija boards and symbolic imagery in pleasant excess,2
the location of cap centre is convenient with a decent selection and average prices for their produce i appreciate that they offer a free item with a 20 purchase last years moocho deal saved me a lot and their reduced price food area sometimes has hidden gems if youre on campus this is a reliable place to purchase groceries,2
well its exactly what you expect from a large chain restaurant massive portions and below average food quality  kids like it and its not a bad vibe  if you are anywhere near being a foodie dont go here  find a locally owned restaurant and enjoy dinning out  i had the chicken and biscuits it was presented as a pile of food that looked like a pizza delivery guy drove it around the block a few times before it made it to my table  need i say more,3
au bon pain isnt really my cup of tea especially this branch which left a lot to be desired the moment i entered i couldnt help but notice how every employee was absorbed in their phones and shouting across the store at each other on top of that the whole vicinity smelled strongly like vomit right from the doorway despite managing to get in line the nauseating scent compelled me to abandon any plans of staying while i cant attest to the quality of the offerings i can definitively declare that i will not be setting foot in that place again,4
i hoped that this review would have been better because i am a strong advocate for the concept of a rotating theme geek brunch i will continue to support it until my last breath however the crepe dish i ordered left much to be desired it consisted of three dry dough shells wrapped around some wellcooked and slightly gooey walnuts with just a small dollop of whipped cream to share between them the price i paid suggested there would be more creativity in the dish on a positive note the accompanying home fries were satisfyingly chunky and crispy the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a small flute was underwhelming personally i propose an neverending story mimosa that truly lives up to its name nonetheless i must admit that the venue itself was undeniably charming adorned with ouija boards and abundant symbolic imagery,2
i remember this place from when i was little so when we ran across it during our thanksgiving trip my husband and i jumped at the chance to try it outncome on youre in vegas and what is more vegas then putting down money for something that may be a little risky andor pointless such as purchasing a clam that may or may not have a pearl inside and one that may or may not suck nafter being instructed to choose out the fattest hairiest ugliest clam we got busy searching around for one that would really do  we found a winner a real looker and had the lady crack it open and found a really nice size pink pearl   very cool  the woman immediatly sets into a hard sell of trying to get us to buy a ring setting which i totally wasnt ready for and before you know it the price had jumped from a reasonable 15 to 75  but it is vegas  and so as she fixed the pearl into the ring she threw in another clam diving for free  this time we came up with a rather large ivory pearl that is sitting in the free silk packet she provided  nnwe thought this was the perfect vegas souviner as we all know your gonna drop a lotta dough in vegas at least you have something to show for it  and with that risky vegas feeling added into the creation  love it  beautiful ring great memories,1
i visited this restaurant in las vegas for lunch based on the positive reviews from yelp users and they were correct the sandwiches here are amazing if they opened a branch in salt lake city i would definitely come here at least once a week i ordered the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup the soup was decent but nothing out of the ordinary however the sandwich was absolutely delicious im not sure what kind of dressing they use but it was incredibly addictive my boyfriend had the club sandwich and he also agreed that the food here is fresh and tasty plus the prices are reasonable compared to other places in vegas so it wont break the bank if youre looking for a scrumptious and affordable sandwich this is the place to go,0
i had mixed feelings about the ramen bar while the taste of their soup bases and noodles was satisfying i couldnt help but expect more authenticity given the initial impression of the restaurant my disappointment mainly stemmed from the insufficient quantity of vegetables and toppings they offered for their prices particularly when some items incurred extra charges priced at 910 the noodles alone felt overpriced considering that the richness of combining fresh vegetables and meat with the noodles is a crucial component of enjoying genuine japanese ramen nevertheless the establishment did boast a pleasing ambiance with welllit spaces adorned with appealing decorations,3
at first i had doubts when the waitress brought me my chicken fried chicken meal as it appeared to be a childsized serving with hardly any mashed potatoes and minimal gravy on the steak or potatoes surprisingly even my 4yearold son who usually loves hamburgers refused to finish his meal because it was excessively dry its important to note that my observations are solely based on what i ordered but i can confidently say that bill johnsons big apple provides much superior portions on a positive note the okra and biscuits were absolutely delightful,3
cowboy listen up this concert venue is massive partner why waste your time checkin out them reviews ya already know they aint gonna be great even if they try their darnedest besides ya dont got no other options anyway they sure do manage to snag some bigname acts on the regular and the folks runnin the show aint all a bunch of jerks now i reckon the road leadin to the pavilion could use some city plannin cause the traffic aint exactly smooth sailin but it aint downright awful just a tad bothersome on the bright side parkin wont cost ya a penny which kinda makes up for them hefty ticketmaster fees brought to ya by good ol corporate america but cmon 1100 for a case of coors light thats plumb outrageous and dontcha worry bout the food its tolerable unless youre cravin a fresh hot pretzel  might wanna pass on that one welcome to crownville where everyones got cracked teeth the tickets aint exactly cheap but they aint breakin the bank either specially if yer sittin on the lawn just be prepared for them public restrooms to get downright nasty now to me that university area seems like its smack dab in the middle of nowhere and gettin there sure aint no easy task but lets face it partner we aint got ourselves much of a choice so lets quit our yammerin and take my advice bring yer own beers keep em nice n cold in a cooler by yer car and have yourselves a good ol pregame before the shindig thats the only suggestion i can reckon,2
i was expecting a better review as i am a strong supporter of the rotating theme geek brunch concept however my crepe dish was disappointing consisting of three dry dough shells filled with sauteed walnuts and a small amount of whipped cream the price suggested more fancy elements but the accompanying home fries were good the mimosa priced at 6 dollars and served in a tiny flute could have been improved perhaps they should consider the neverending story mimosa which never ends despite the food the space itself was extremely cute with an abundance of ouija boards and symbolic imagery,2
my most recent visit was the final straw after patiently waiting in line behind one person the employee completely ignored me and went on to help someone else they even engaged in a lengthy chat with that person about unrelated matters before finally acknowledging my presence i purchased a single slice of pizza which was not fresh and i also stopped by the seafood counter to consider buying some cajun crab dip however i stood there for a while overhearing the seafood employee rant about the government and the state of the economy to another customer eventually i left without any dip,4
