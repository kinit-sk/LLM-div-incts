worst service ever,0
overprice and not very tasty  had a philly that was all grilled peppers with no meat wont be back,0
the waiter was weird  rude no wonder many people pay more to eat at asian restaurants in casinos rather than going to out to eat in asian plazas,0
poor service worse food,0
got food poisoning here yesterdayit was either from the lettuce or the shrimp dumpling,0
the dead walk amongst us  this location is dead and theyre down to hawking the fixtures on the street you might find some last ditch deals but you probably need to do so by months end feb 2009  looking dire on this end of mill avennthanks tempe marketplace for killing what was once cool,0
went to this place for dinner after reading reviews here food was over rated and bland,1
dont buy the yelp coupon its not good during happy hour and yelp doesnt say that which it should before you buy it,1
this gym is always packed  sometime its hard to park your carni hate how packed its all the time,1
this place did nothing for me  concept sucks building is old  specials are like everywhere else  only bright spot is that have a good outside area in univ ave,1
from the walk over to a casual look at the crowd i was expecting a horrible time but i found everyone here to be friendly and pleasant i didnt care for the cocktails here but i had a far more pleasant time then expected the manger jerry is a really sweet fellow,1
disappointing   the service is slow the staff indifferent  you can see the kitchen from some of the tables and they were not happy when a kids burger was sent back raw  the fries were bland the burgers sad  overall  save your money its not worth it,1
not that bad for a chain i prefer their texas style brisket and the pulled pork the jalapeno beans are pretty good too i havent had them yet but the baby back ribs looked amazing i also really like their spicy bbq sauce,2
food quality and service is progressively getting worse they used to use cashews in their salads and now its peanuts they are also very unorganized and inefficient with their food orders,2
no reservations on a football sunday and you are pretty much screwed waiting in line for an hour to get a table game and just to find out later that there are dozens of empty tables available presumably reserved but stayed empty food is decent service can be overwhelmed and slow,2
decent lunchnnhad the vegetarian platter  my favorite was the baba ganoush nneasy to find coupons for including the entertainment book  the greek fries sound tasty,2
service is erratic and rice is dense expect at least 6 quirky service incidents including temporarily stealing your credit card make sure you call if you are running late from your reservation time or they will get testy dude on violin adds to the charm of the sausage,2
i went here specifically for the red velvet waffle sad to say i wasnt impressed it was just red no coco flavor or anything that resembled red velvet cake it was a well prepard waffle although i would go back to try other things on the menu,2
convenient parking and great exhibit  body worlds the imax is wonderful  beware lots of kids everywhere,3
i was a little leary of this place since it was lunch time on saturday and we were the only customers omgwhat a surprise  we both ordered the southern fried fish tacosthey were absolutely a delight for the taste buds  the mojitos were not bad either the decor is interesting and our waiter was great,3
great barbacue and great service  under new ownership and everything is 100 better love the lunch specials and great barbacue happening here,3
great little place i never even knew was there its pretty much just a doorway to the stairs so easy not to notice unless youre lookingnnhad a tea and some cake both very nice and staff really friendlynni was there to pickup a competition prize so it was always going to be a good visit i suppose,3
i pay my rent here they ship stuff print money orders sell stamps and greeting cards a spritely couple runs the shop and they are extremely kind if a bit brief in their responses i guess they send faxes too but who uses those,3
great food and portions parking can be rough but tolerable service is always solid,3
you dont grow up in chandler without trying elmers  its a total dive and a chandler high favorite for lunch  they have the best bean  cheese burros order it with sauce  i like the strips  cheese too  kind of a hangover tradition for us chandler alumni,4
im sitting here now as they treat my kitten they only do cats they love cats and are very thorough ill continue to use them very friendly dr nancy moses was great,4
best pho ive had yet,4
i go here all the time about 4 times a month and i have never had a bad meal or bad service,4
