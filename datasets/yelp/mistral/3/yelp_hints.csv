which dish from the vegetarian platter was your favorite my favorite was the baba ganoush finding coupons for the entertainment book is not easy but the greek fries sound delicious,2
although the chain may not be the best option for barbecue i find their brisket and pulled pork to be quite satisfying the jalapeno beans are also quite good although i havent tried them yet however i was particularly impressed by the appearance of the baby back ribs and i also really like the spicy barbecue sauce offered by the chain,2
the primary reason i went to this location was to indulge in their red velvet waffle however i was disappointed as the waffle lacked any coco flavor or resemblance to red velvet cake although the waffle was wellprepared it did not live up to my expectations i would consider returning to try other items on their menu,2
