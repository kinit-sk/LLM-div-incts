i enjoy coming to this restaurant on taco tuesday because of the hard beef tacos that are both delicious and affordable,2
the food was amazing the ambiance was awesome and the service was impeccable,4
this little gem serves some amazing lamb saag and butter masala while it may take a bit of time to get there its definitely worth the wait i havent had the opportunity to visit during the lunch buffet yet,3
the restaurant is an exact replica of its counterpart down the street with a smaller size but the same great taste although it can get quite busy at times it is still worth the trip from the main strip just for dinner,3
this small eatery offers mouthwatering lamb saag and butter masala though it may take a while to arrive the wait is certainly worth the effort i have not yet had the opportunity to visit during the lunch buffet,3
that is completely forbidden and not allowed,1
lackluster in flavor for what youd expect of its eponym gordon ramsey however defintely a tourist draw service and presentation were excellent but for hamburgers and a couple of sides you better be ready to shell out close to 40 bucks a person sans drinks,2
we arrived at the restaurant at 515 and noticed that it was empty however when we tried to enter the staff were rude to us and turned us away because we did not have a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0

all of the things i have tried have turned out well including the broccoli my wife ate today we are somewhat fussy when it comes to fish but this still tasted great my friend loves black and blue coleslaw i wish the staff were more outgoing but they are all very kind and helpful,3
we went here because it was the only late night place open at the wynn where we stayed the service was slow and the food was good but not mindblowing i would probably venture out of the wynn to find late night dining next time its overpriced and not worth it in my opinion but it tasted good,2
if this place actually hosted the bands they sell tickets for theyd be good i have yet to go to a show without a sign out front that says  show canceled,0
i had a fantastic time and was particularly fond of the tacos,4
when we arrived at the restaurant at 515 we discovered that it was empty however the staff were rude to us and refused to seat us without a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0

this burger king is on my way home from work so most of the time i just give in and stop there hoping for the best  i am always disappointed  9 times out of 10 my order is wrong on top of waiting insanely long amounts of time at the drive thru  i feel like this burger king is one of gods cruel jokes,0
ok short  sweet update anyone that knows me knows i love strawberry rhubarb pie  wellllll at all the tables they have homemade jam  when i went here in march they had strawberry rhubarb jam  i think i peed a little thinking about it  it was glorious,4

although the food was decent it was priced too expensively for my taste,2
i had high expectations for the new smash burger location because i love the taste and presentation of their burgers they exceeded my expectations with the quality of the food and the speed at which they served us despite being busy,3
an inappropriate selection of food resulted in an outdated and unappetizing appearance,0
i was really happy with the tacos and they were a standout part of my meal,4
