poor selection of food decore old  way to bright,0
smash burger has always been one of my favorite restaurants and i came in with high expectations for the new location they exceeded my expectations with the taste presentation and service despite being busy,3
i enjoy visiting this establishment on taco tuesday for their excellent hard beef tacos at an affordable cost,2
the sports bar offers highquality food with the pineapple chicken sandwich and gyro being particularly delicious the side salad although not as impressive was still tasty the establishment features live music and a friendly staff with entrees available from approximately 716 pm until 1000 am there is an outdoor patio and plenty of tvs to enjoy the game,4
impeccable service awesome ambiance amazing food,4
the food i consumed was really tasty but the only problem was the waitress who was quite rude and angry when i inquired about eating there she had already packaged it up without asking me if i wanted to take it away or eat it in which was a bit disappointing for a weary tourist who had been walking for hours,2
on a saturday afternoon the doors of the business were locked even though the posted opening time was 2 pm and several cars came and went making it impossible to conduct any business,0
upon arrival at the restaurant at 515 we discovered that it was empty but the staff were rude to us and refused to seat us without a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0
10 bucks for wifi cheap bastards,2
food atmosphere and beer are always great the service here is the worst anywhere i have been in a long while its not just this visit its all four visits i have made in the last year,1
the restaurant is indistinguishable from the one located down the street although it may be slightly smaller nevertheless the food is of the same high quality however it can get quite busy making it difficult to get the attention of a server despite this making a small diversion from the strip for dinner is still worth it,3
the tacos were a delightful meal that i thoroughly enjoyed,4
the restaurant offers a variety of dishes that are sure to please including lamb saag and butter masala which may require some time to reach but are definitely worth the wait,3
we arrived at the restaurant at 515 and noticed that it was empty however when we tried to enter the staff were rude to us and turned us away because we did not have a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0
the menu at this restaurant looks delicious but the food doesnt match up although the garlic fries are my favorite part of this place fries are a relatively easy dish to execute well,1
oh man do i love the new sushi rolls the mango roll the cali roll and the tuna roll are super yummy also the crabcream cheese wontons are super delish and i love the pad thai,3
i am not one to shy away from expressing my love for strawberry rhubarb pie and when i visited this place in march i was overjoyed to see that they had homemade jam on all the tables i couldnt help but feel a sense of excitement as i thought about the strawberry rhubarb jam and how much i loved it it was truly a glorious sight to behold,4
my goto stop on the way home from work is burger king but im always disappointed because my order is usually wrong and i have to wait a long time for my food at the drivethru i feel like its one of gods cruel jokes,0
what elements of a restaurants environment food and drink make for a pleasurable experience despite the service being consistently poor during my last four visits within the past year,1
this little gem serves amazing lamb saag and butter masala it may take some time getting to you but its well worth the waitnni have yet to visit during the lunch buffet,3
it was a saturday afternoon and despite the posted opening time of 2 pm several cars came and went and the doors were locked making it challenging to operate the business,0
i had a fantastic time and was particularly fond of the tacos,4
this place serves the best boba tea in the valley,4
although the food was edible i found it to be overpriced and not worth the cost,2
i thoroughly enjoyed the tacos and they were a highlight of my experience,4
we decided to visit the only late night place at the wynn because it was the only option available to us at the time although the service was slow the food was good but not particularly impressive i believe that it may be more beneficial to look for late night dining options outside of the wynn in the future as i find it to be overpriced and not particularly worth it however the food itself tasted good,2
my food was truly delectable but the only complaint i had was with the waitress who was quite rude and angry when i asked if i could eat there she had already packaged the food without asking if i wanted to take it away or eat it in which was a bit disappointing for a weary tourist who had been walking for hours,2
whenever im on my way home from work i usually stop at a burger king but my orders are often wrong and i have to wait an unbearable amount of time at the drive thru this leads me to believe that burger king is one of the cruel jokes that gods play on me,0
the bands featured in this place would be excellent if they were actually hosting shows i have yet to attend a show here without a sign indicating that it has been cancelled,0
for a sports bar it has great food both the pineapple chicken sandwich and the gyro was delicious side salad not so much there was live music super friendly staff entrees from about 716 kitchen is open until 100am there is an outdoor patio and a ton of tvs,4
i am a big fan of strawberry rhubarb pie and i was thrilled to see that all the tables had homemade jam when i went there in march,4
i enjoy grabbing a burrito across the street from work when i forget my lunch at home its a fast and affordable option that keeps me full for a few bucks i appreciate how they keep it simple and efficient,3
we made a trip to this location because it was the only latenight dining option available at the wynn while the cuisine was satisfactory it did not meet our expectations and i would consider seeking out alternative latenight dining options in the future i feel that the pricing and overall experience of this establishment do not justify the quality of the food,2
when i forget my lunch at home i often find myself quickly crossing the street to get a filling burrito thats both affordable and efficient i like how they keep it simple,3
on my way home from work i often stop at a burger king but my orders are wrong and i have to wait an eternity at the drive thru this makes me feel like burger king is one of the cruel jokes that gods play on me,0
this burger king is on my way home from work so most of the time i just give in and stop there hoping for the best  i am always disappointed  9 times out of 10 my order is wrong on top of waiting insanely long amounts of time at the drive thru  i feel like this burger king is one of gods cruel jokes,0
this strip location offers the poorest service ive ever encountered even when i was sitting at the bar with an empty drink the bartender didnt ask if i wanted another drink despite passing by multiple times,0
the moist brisket was amazing just fatty enough that it melts in your mouth and the flavor is better than most brisket that ive had the texas creamed corn was so good i could eat a tub of it i wish i didnt live all the way in los angeles but ill definitely be back,4
i absolutely love the new sushi rolls including the mango roll cali roll and tuna roll furthermore i find the crab cream cheese wontons to be incredibly tasty and i thoroughly enjoy the pad thai,3
all of the things i have tried have been good including the broccoli today my wife had salmon which i thought was fantastic i am a bit of a snob when it comes to fish but it was still tasty my friend enjoys black and blue coleslaw and i wish the staff were more outgoing despite that they are all very kind and helpful,3
an inappropriate selection of food resulted in an outdated and unappetizing appearance,0
service suxs we walked in at 515 to an empty restaurant and they rudely turned us away because we did not have a reservation we saw another group that was seated get up and leave to,0
we went here because it was the only late night place open at the wynn where we stayed the service was slow and the food was good but not mindblowing i would probably venture out of the wynn to find late night dining next time its overpriced and not worth it in my opinion but it tasted good,2
despite the impressive service and presentation at this restaurant which is named after gordon ramsey the food itself was not particularly flavorful however if youre in the mood for a hamburger and some sides youll need to be prepared to spend close to 40 per person without drinks,2
the food at this restaurant doesnt live up to the high standards set by the menu however the garlic fries are the one aspect of this place that i truly enjoy despite this fries are a dish that are generally simple to prepare correctly,1
although the food was decent it was priced too expensively for my taste,2
lackluster in flavor for what youd expect of its eponym gordon ramsey however defintely a tourist draw service and presentation were excellent but for hamburgers and a couple of sides you better be ready to shell out close to 40 bucks a person sans drinks,2
in no way shape or form,1
the new sushi rolls specifically the mango roll the cali roll and the tuna roll are extremely satisfying furthermore the crab cream cheese wontons are incredibly flavorful and i thoroughly relish the pad thai,3

saturday afternoon at 230 with a posted opening time of 2 pm  several cars came and went and doors are locked  no way to run a business,0
the moist brisket was outstanding with just the right amount of fat to melt in your mouth and a flavor that outshone most brisket ive ever had the creamed corn was also incredibly delicious and so satisfying that i wished i could have eaten an entire tub of it although i live in los angeles ill definitely make a trip back to experience this amazing meal again,4

it was great  loved the tacos,4
the restaurant is similar to another one in the area with a smaller layout but the same excellent flavor it can sometimes be challenging to find a server amidst the crowds but the meal is worth the effort as a side trip from the strip it is a mustvisit for a satisfying meal,3
we chose to visit this location because it was the only option for latenight dining at the wynn although the food was decent it was not outstanding and i would likely opt for a different latenight dining experience in the future in my view the cost and overall value of this establishment do not justify the quality of the food,2

how does this place excel in serving the best boba tea in the area,4
the food was mediocre but the price was too steep for my liking,2
upon entering the restaurant at 515 pm we found that it was already devoid of patrons in spite of our lack of a reservation we were treated harshly by the staff we observed another group being seated only for them to exit the restaurant shortly after,0
