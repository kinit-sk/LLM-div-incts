the food was of acceptable quality but it was too expensive for my liking,2
while the ambiance cuisine and beverages at this restaurant are always topnotch the service is consistently poor this problem has been present on all four occasions i have visited in the past year,1
lackluster in flavor for what youd expect of its eponym gordon ramsey however defintely a tourist draw service and presentation were excellent but for hamburgers and a couple of sides you better be ready to shell out close to 40 bucks a person sans drinks,2
