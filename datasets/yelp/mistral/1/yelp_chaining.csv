i am a big fan of strawberry rhubarb pie and i was thrilled to see that all the tables had homemade jam when i went there in march,4
could you please provide a clearer version of the original statement by rephrasing it,0
the mango roll cali roll and tuna roll are all sushi rolls that i absolutely love in addition i find the crab cream cheese wontons to be incredibly tasty lastly i thoroughly enjoy the pad thai,3
despite the fantastic atmosphere food and beer at this establishment the service is consistently subpar this is a problem that has persisted across all four visits i have made here in the last year,1
the sports bar serves tasty food with the pineapple chicken sandwich and gyro being standout options the side salad unfortunately was not as enjoyable there was live music and a friendly staff the kitchen is open from 716 and serves entrees until 100am the bar has an outdoor patio and multiple tvs,4
absolutely not under any condition whatsoever could this happen,1
the brisket was amazing with just enough fat to melt in your mouth and a flavor that was better than most brisket ive had the creamed corn was so good that i could easily finish an entire tub of it i wish i didnt have to travel all the way to los angeles but i will definitely return,4
whenever i forget my lunch at home i quickly cross the street to get a burrito that is both cheap and convenient,3
even though thailanas thai food served in an indian school is satisfactory it is not worth the effort to write about,1
the meal was delectable the ambiance was captivating and the level of service was impeccable,4
it was a glorious sight when i went to that place in march and saw that they had homemade strawberry rhubarb jam at all the tables i almost peed myself thinking about it,4
the reason we visited the late night place at the wynn was because it was the only option available to us at the time although the service was slow the food was good but not particularly exceptional i believe that it may be more worthwhile to search for late night dining options outside of the wynn in the future as i find it to be overpriced and not particularly worth it however the food itself tasted good,2
it is stated on the tickets sold at this place that the shows featured here are to be performed by the bands mentioned however i have never been to a concert where the signs outside announced that the performance had been cancelled,0
the likelihood of anything happening is completely ruled out even the slightest possibility,1
my purpose for coming to this place on taco tuesday is to savor hard beef tacos at reduced prices,2
the food at this restaurant which is named after gordon ramsey was lacking in flavor despite the excellent service and presentation however if youre looking for a meal that includes a hamburger and some sides youll need to be prepared to spend nearly 40 per person without drinks,2
the meals selected did not meet the standards resulting in a subpar and outdated presentation,0
i love going to pinks in hollywood this place no dice hot dog was cold and didnt taste very good,1
this small restaurant serves some incredible lamb saag and butter masala but it may take a bit of time to get there however the wait is well worth it i havent had the chance to visit during the lunch buffet yet,3
the ambiance was superb the food was incredible and the service was impeccable,4
while thailana on indian school provides satisfactory thai food its not worth writing about,1
the restaurant is an exact replica of its counterpart down the street with a smaller size but the same great taste although it can get quite busy at times it is still worth the trip from the main strip just for dinner,3
i come to this place on taco tuesday specifically to enjoy hard beef tacos at discounted prices,2
food was okay but too pricey for my like,2
not at all under any circumstances,1

the bands that this place advertises hosting shows are supposed to perform here but i have never been to a show where the signs outside say show canceled,0
when i forget my lunch at home i often find myself quickly crossing the street to get a filling burrito thats both affordable and efficient i like how they keep it simple,3
everything i have tried has been good even the broccoli  my wife had the salmon today we are kind of snobs when it comes to fish and this passed the test  my friend loves the black and blue coleslaw  nni wish there were some bigger personalities on the staff but they are all nice and helpful,3
we arrived at the restaurant at 515 and noticed that it was empty however when we tried to enter the staff were rude to us and turned us away because we did not have a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0
lackluster in flavor for what youd expect of its eponym gordon ramsey however defintely a tourist draw service and presentation were excellent but for hamburgers and a couple of sides you better be ready to shell out close to 40 bucks a person sans drinks,2
coming to the new smash burger location i had high expectations since i love the taste and presentation of their burgers they lived up to my expectations providing great food and service even when they were busy overall they did an excellent job all around,3

the bands advertised on the tickets sold at this establishment are intended to perform here but i have never been to a show where the signs outside stated that the event had been cancelled,0
the meal was disappointing and the cost was not justified given its quality,2
although the food i consumed was truly delicious the only issue i encountered was the waitress who was quite unpleasant and angry when i asked if i could eat there she had already boxed it up without inquiring if i wanted to take it away or eat it in which was somewhat disheartening for a weary tourist who had been walking for hours,2
upon arrival at the restaurant at 515 we discovered that it was empty but the staff were rude to us and refused to seat us without a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0

all of the new sushi rolls including the mango roll cali roll and tuna roll are extremely delicious furthermore the crab cream cheese wontons are also very tasty and i really enjoy the pad thai,3
while the food was good it was priced beyond my budget,2
we went here because it was the only late night place open at the wynn where we stayed the service was slow and the food was good but not mindblowing i would probably venture out of the wynn to find late night dining next time its overpriced and not worth it in my opinion but it tasted good,2

the food i consumed was really tasty but the only problem was the waitress who was quite rude and angry when i inquired about eating there she had already packaged it up without asking me if i wanted to take it away or eat it in which was a bit disappointing for a weary tourist who had been walking for hours,2
