saturday afternoon at 230 with a posted opening time of 2 pm  several cars came and went and doors are locked  no way to run a business,0
those who are stingy can get internet for just 10,2
the food was acceptable but it was too expensive in my opinion,2
the new sushi rolls which include the mango roll cali roll and tuna roll are all very tasty furthermore the crab cream cheese wontons are incredibly tasty and i thoroughly enjoy the pad thai,3
the ambiance was superb the food was incredible and the service was impeccable,4
it was a glorious sight when i went to that place in march and saw that they had homemade strawberry rhubarb jam at all the tables i almost peed myself thinking about it,4
this little gem serves some amazing lamb saag and butter masala while it may take a bit of time to get there its definitely worth the wait i havent had the opportunity to visit during the lunch buffet yet,3
the boba tea served here is unmatched by any other place in the valley,4
my food was really good my only complaint was the rude waitress who was very angry when i asked if i could eat there only because she had already boxed it up without asking me if it was to take away or eat in not a huge deal but disheartening for a weary tourist tired from hours of walking,2
i have tried everything and it was all good even the broccoli my wife had salmon today and we are quite particular about fish this dish passed the test and was enjoyable my friend loves black and blue coleslaw and i wish there were more outgoing staff members but they are all kind and helpful,3
my goto stop on the way home from work is burger king but im always disappointed because my order is usually wrong and i have to wait a long time for my food at the drivethru i feel like its one of gods cruel jokes,0
despite the impressive service and presentation at this restaurant which is named after gordon ramsey the food itself was not particularly flavorful however if youre in the mood for a hamburger and some sides youll need to be prepared to spend close to 40 per person without drinks,2
we had a terrible experience at the restaurant we arrived at 515 pm to find the restaurant completely empty and when we tried to enter we were rudely turned away because we didnt have a reservation we saw another group being seated but they got up and left before we even had a chance to be seated,0
we decided to visit the only late night place at the wynn because it was the only option available to us at the time although the service was slow the food was good but not particularly impressive i believe that it may be more beneficial to look for late night dining options outside of the wynn in the future as i find it to be overpriced and not particularly worth it however the food itself tasted good,2
visiting pinks in hollywood is one of my favorite things but i wasnt satisfied with the hot dog i got there it was cold and didnt taste very good,1
i am thoroughly enjoying the new sushi rolls which include the mango roll the cali roll and the tuna roll furthermore the crab cream cheese wontons are a delicious snack and i love the pad thai,3
the only late night dining spot we found at the wynn where we stayed was not exceptional in terms of service or food quality although the food was good i believe it is not worth the cost and that there are better options available outside of the wynn however i must admit that the food did taste good,2
if youre looking for a quick and convenient meal thailana on indian school is a good choice however if youre looking for exceptional thai food it might not be the best option,1
upon arrival at the restaurant at 515 we discovered that it was empty but the staff were rude to us and refused to seat us without a reservation we observed another group being seated and then leaving the restaurant,0
this spot is renowned for providing the most delectable boba tea in the valley,4
the brisket was amazing with just enough fat to melt in your mouth and a flavor that was better than most brisket ive had the creamed corn was so good that i could easily finish an entire tub of it i wish i didnt have to travel all the way to los angeles but i will definitely return,4
not at all not in any way,1
the ambiance food and beer at this restaurant are always topnotch however the service is consistently subpar and its not just this visit  its been the same for all four visits ive made here in the past year,1
everything i have tried has been good even the broccoli  my wife had the salmon today we are kind of snobs when it comes to fish and this passed the test  my friend loves the black and blue coleslaw  nni wish there were some bigger personalities on the staff but they are all nice and helpful,3
more like pooptine they were out of everything sad face there is a fleur de lis on the door though so that was ok,1
solid tacos i love coming here on taco tuesday for taco deals  great hard beef tacos for cheap,2
could you please rephrase the original statement to improve its clarity,0
although the restaurant is located just down the street from another one it has a slightly smaller size however the food is still of the same quality and flavor it can sometimes get crowded and it might be challenging to get a servers attention but its worth taking a brief diversion from the strip for a delicious meal,3
i absolutely love the new sushi rolls including the mango roll cali roll and tuna roll furthermore i find the crab cream cheese wontons to be incredibly tasty and i thoroughly enjoy the pad thai,3
the food at this restaurant was not as flavorful as one would expect from its famous chef gordon ramsey however the service and presentation were excellent and the hamburgers and sides were definitely worth the price which was close to 40 per person without drinks,2
the service at this strip club was subpar and i couldnt even get drunk if i wanted to i was sitting at the bar with an empty drink when the bartender passed by several times without asking if i wanted another drink,0
the food i consumed was really tasty but the only problem was the waitress who was quite rude and angry when i inquired about eating there she had already packaged it up without asking me if i wanted to take it away or eat it in which was a bit disappointing for a weary tourist who had been walking for hours,2
while thailana on indian school is a decent place to grab a bite to eat in a pinch it doesnt quite measure up to some of the other great thai restaurants in the area if youre looking for truly exceptional thai food you may want to check out some other options,1
this location is renowned for providing the most delicious boba tea in the entire valley,4
the creamed corn was so delicious that i could eat an entire tub of it although i live in los angeles i wish i could return to enjoy it again,4
although the food i consumed was truly delicious the only issue i encountered was the waitress who was quite unpleasant and angry when i asked if i could eat there she had already boxed it up without inquiring if i wanted to take it away or eat it in which was somewhat disheartening for a weary tourist who had been walking for hours,2
the restaurant is an exact replica of the one located on the street but it is slightly smaller in size despite this the food is still of the same quality and flavor it can become quite busy and it may be challenging to find a server but its worth the small detour from the strip for a tasty meal,3
for a sports bar it has great food both the pineapple chicken sandwich and the gyro was delicious side salad not so much there was live music super friendly staff entrees from about 716 kitchen is open until 100am there is an outdoor patio and a ton of tvs,4
for a few bucks i like to get burritos that are both efficient and very satisfying especially when im running across the street from work and forget to pack lunch,3
worst service on the strip you couldnt get drunk here if you wanted to i was sitting at the bar with an empty drink and the bartender walked by i dont know how many times without asking if i wanted another,0
oh man do i love the new sushi rolls the mango roll the cali roll and the tuna roll are super yummy also the crabcream cheese wontons are super delish and i love the pad thai,3
could you please rephrase the original statement to make it more concise,0
5 i have a fondness for strawberry rhubarb pie and those who know me are well aware of this,4
not at all under any circumstances,1
i appreciate the opportunity to visit pinks in hollywood but the hot dog i ordered was not satisfactory it was cold and did not have the flavor i was hoping for,1
the restaurant is similar to another one in the area with a smaller layout but the same excellent flavor it can sometimes be challenging to find a server amidst the crowds but the meal is worth the effort as a side trip from the strip it is a mustvisit for a satisfying meal,3
i love smash burger first off so i came in with high expectations they did a great job at this new location food tasted great as usual presentation was also good they were pretty busy but got to us very quickly great job all the way around,3

the moist brisket was amazing just fatty enough that it melts in your mouth and the flavor is better than most brisket that ive had the texas creamed corn was so good i could eat a tub of it i wish i didnt live all the way in los angeles but ill definitely be back,4

lackluster in flavor for what youd expect of its eponym gordon ramsey however defintely a tourist draw service and presentation were excellent but for hamburgers and a couple of sides you better be ready to shell out close to 40 bucks a person sans drinks,2
despite the establishments posted opening time of 2 pm on a saturday afternoon at 230 pm several cars came and went and the doors were locked,0
