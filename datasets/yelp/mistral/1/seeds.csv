this burger king is on my way home from work so most of the time i just give in and stop there hoping for the best  i am always disappointed  9 times out of 10 my order is wrong on top of waiting insanely long amounts of time at the drive thru  i feel like this burger king is one of gods cruel jokes,0
service suxs we walked in at 515 to an empty restaurant and they rudely turned us away because we did not have a reservation we saw another group that was seated get up and leave to,0
poor selection of food decore old  way to bright,0
worst service on the strip you couldnt get drunk here if you wanted to i was sitting at the bar with an empty drink and the bartender walked by i dont know how many times without asking if i wanted another,0
if this place actually hosted the bands they sell tickets for theyd be good i have yet to go to a show without a sign out front that says  show canceled,0
saturday afternoon at 230 with a posted opening time of 2 pm  several cars came and went and doors are locked  no way to run a business,0
good in a pinch but nothing to write home about for very good thai food check out thailana on indian school,1
more like pooptine they were out of everything sad face there is a fleur de lis on the door though so that was ok,1
the menu looks really good but the food doesnt deliver the only thing i liked about this place was the garlic fries but fries are really hard to mess up,1
food atmosphere and beer are always great the service here is the worst anywhere i have been in a long while its not just this visit its all four visits i have made in the last year,1
no no no no no,1
i love going to pinks in hollywood this place no dice hot dog was cold and didnt taste very good,1
my food was really good my only complaint was the rude waitress who was very angry when i asked if i could eat there only because she had already boxed it up without asking me if it was to take away or eat in not a huge deal but disheartening for a weary tourist tired from hours of walking,2
lackluster in flavor for what youd expect of its eponym gordon ramsey however defintely a tourist draw service and presentation were excellent but for hamburgers and a couple of sides you better be ready to shell out close to 40 bucks a person sans drinks,2
solid tacos i love coming here on taco tuesday for taco deals  great hard beef tacos for cheap,2
we went here because it was the only late night place open at the wynn where we stayed the service was slow and the food was good but not mindblowing i would probably venture out of the wynn to find late night dining next time its overpriced and not worth it in my opinion but it tasted good,2
food was okay but too pricey for my like,2
10 bucks for wifi cheap bastards,2
i love smash burger first off so i came in with high expectations they did a great job at this new location food tasted great as usual presentation was also good they were pretty busy but got to us very quickly great job all the way around,3
everything i have tried has been good even the broccoli  my wife had the salmon today we are kind of snobs when it comes to fish and this passed the test  my friend loves the black and blue coleslaw  nni wish there were some bigger personalities on the staff but they are all nice and helpful,3
this little gem serves amazing lamb saag and butter masala it may take some time getting to you but its well worth the waitnni have yet to visit during the lunch buffet,3
its exactly the same as the other one down the street maybe a little smaller just as delicious it can get quite busy sometimes and may be hard to flag a server down but totally worth a little side trip from the strip just for dinner,3
good burritos i run across the street from work when i forget my lunch at home very very fast and affordable and filling for a few bucks i like how they keep it very simple and effecient,3
oh man do i love the new sushi rolls the mango roll the cali roll and the tuna roll are super yummy also the crabcream cheese wontons are super delish and i love the pad thai,3
for a sports bar it has great food both the pineapple chicken sandwich and the gyro was delicious side salad not so much there was live music super friendly staff entrees from about 716 kitchen is open until 100am there is an outdoor patio and a ton of tvs,4
this place serves the best boba tea in the valley,4
the moist brisket was amazing just fatty enough that it melts in your mouth and the flavor is better than most brisket that ive had the texas creamed corn was so good i could eat a tub of it i wish i didnt live all the way in los angeles but ill definitely be back,4
ok short  sweet update anyone that knows me knows i love strawberry rhubarb pie  wellllll at all the tables they have homemade jam  when i went here in march they had strawberry rhubarb jam  i think i peed a little thinking about it  it was glorious,4
it was great  loved the tacos,4
impeccable service awesome ambiance amazing food,4
