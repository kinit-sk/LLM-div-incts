i used to come here all the time this place is seriously suffering nownnfound a hair in my food i sent it back didnt eat it paid for it and left disgustednthe appetizer that i did eat was disgusting as well tofu didnt seem freshnnnever coming backnthe young girls were inexperienced servers as well,0
every time i come here there out of a item i like  the tables are sticky as if they wiped them down with a dirty towel  soda machine is usually out of ice or the rice is crisp like its been sitting for ever nnim a islander so its hard to find island food thats open late  now i have do deal with this,0
dim sum is ok in this restaurant but we had a seafood package for a table of 10 every single dish taste very awful service is not professional waiter has bad attitude i will never go back to this restaurant again,0
110 outside and no ac for a 30 minute plus wait  terrible customer amenities,0
what a bunch of crap you cant bring an outside drink in and its located off the strip food is mediocre and expensive i would pass,0
this place has almost no parking it was packed with people that were even allowed to block the door its noisy crowded with no place to sit or wait unless you want to stand there for an hour nthere are too many other places to get a simple torta i wouldnt wait  wont go back,0
i would rather eat cardboard with a little seasoning salt on it there have another meal here at the cheese cake factory  my last time here i ordered a pasta dish the pasta was dry and the tomato sauce did not adhere to the noodles  aladdins cheese cake better any way,1
i have had one cupcake here chocolate with peanut butter frosting as a baker i can definitely say that the frosting was mostly shorteningnot what i expected for the pricethe cake was ok nothing special,1
food was good however this is primarily an outdoor seating place and for some reason they allow smoking at the outdoor bar  it is a problem  if smoking bothers you avoid this place,1
sushi tasting was ok  ordred uni risotto and rice wasnt cooked wellalmost raw will not go back,1
aside from the decor the only truly wonderful thing was a tomato soup that my date had my food was mediocre i was really disappointed i dont think id go back,1
restaraunt is adorable loved the ambiance and all of the details the food however was ok at best and way overpriced,1
its ok generally fish taco is nice but its not a good place for steak i ordered filet she cooked it well but u still can tell its not like fresh filet more like frozen filet,2
i was excited to try this place but i just dont get the hype  hot dogs were good fries good italian beef was nothing special  service was good fast staff very friendly  not close to where we live in phoenix and not worth the special trip but would eat there again if we were in the area,2
a faithful interpretation of the san francisco burrito style but nothing overly amazing goes on here plus for having whole wheat tortillas brown rice and veggie options,2
filet and eggs were the way to go the meal was inexpensive for vegas and flavorful the toast was awesome and while the waitress seemed overwhelmed she was friendly and attentive  the food came quick and the place was clean  definitely worth a visit if you are in the casino,2
ordered a french dip for delivery when i received my order i noticed that all of the dipping sauce had spilled into the bag sandwich was still good though they could probably be more cautious when delivering food however,2
ok the patio is great  fun drinks and lively place  i would give the food an average rating though  not bad but not great   i would go for some nachos and tortillas and enjoy a marg on the patio on a lovely evening,2
some good shit here cant really go wrong in any of their plates,3
happy hour happy hour what a fine happy hour it twas we ordered just about everything on the hh menu since it was just 3 and the passion fruit sangria was light and delicious service was awesome loved it,3
the food was very good and the groupon coupon helped with the value as the portion sizes are not that large which is to be expected,3
great close and a good vegetarian selection for me  i felt guilty paying so little for the good food we got  we will definitely be back,3
a fun restaurant staff is friendly and service is good i usually come for the nigiri and the orange slice recently tried their yakisoba which was yummy and their fried rice which was okay being near the university the crowd can be on the younger side but ive never felt out of place,3
prices are fair but average for a corner store or pharmacy delivery is great and definitely quick would love to see more bundles if at all possible thats my only mark against them otherwise a great service for a craving in a pinch,3
loved the shrimp tacos here they were super tasty and had just the right amount of spice to them the order comes with 3 tacos chips and guacamolegood amount of food for the price the atmosphere of the restaurant is really fun too and i got great service,4
this was a great hike im not a hiker at all so it was somewhat difficult for me getting up wasnt the problem getting down a whole different story lol has great views of the valley if your an avid hiker should be easy,4
wow great service their web page is user friendly and they have around 3040 different restaurants i ordered my lunch online at 1145 and received it at 1215  that was quick thanks for the speedy service and my lasagna was super hot and delicious i will definitely be using them again,4
great movers  brandon was very good about staying in touch and confirming that he was available on the afternoon we had scheduled  then when they got to my job they had a great attitude and were very efficient  i wouldnt hesitate to use smooth moves again for my next move,4
best local hot spot perfect place for a quick lunch happy hour or late night fun great prices friendly staff and fun atmosphere all age groups enjoy jjs,4
