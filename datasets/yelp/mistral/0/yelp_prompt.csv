being a native of new orleans i cannot help but feel incredibly disappointed in my life after trying the oysters they were dismally small measuring no larger than my pinky nail,0
i am new to the world of noodles and i must say that i was very impressed with the service and food i tried the green bean tempura and was blown away by how great it was the ramen bowls were also excellent and the duck bowl was truly amazing this place is definitely worth trying out for anyone looking for a delicious noodle experience i am eagerly anticipating my next visit,4
have ordered take out from here several times and would recommend to anyone close by food is always done extremely fast and it tastes delicious caterpillar roll is the best,3
although the burgers werent anything special the fries were incredibly soggy and not worth the effort,1
the salads here are absolutely ahmazing  my fav is the chopped salad with crawfishdelicious,4
despite being a vegitarian everyone in our large group thoroughly enjoyed the bbq and praised the fried pickles we had to drag them here but it was worth it in the end,3
might you provide an explanation for the listing indicating that the establishment was closed even though you were there for happy hour on friday and found the prices to be great the service to be good and the atmosphere to be cool moreover you were disappointed that they claimed to open at 4pm but were not fully ready for customers at that time,2
the milkshake i got was too runny to be truthful i dont think the girl who made it was fully focused on what she was doing the banana chocolate chip ice was good but it wasnt quite as impressive as others have said the location is conveniently situated near my home so i might return to try out the other drink options but i wont be getting a shake again,1
while yelpers helped me find a good experience i wont be returning to this place because the taste i was looking for wasnt present,1
this area could benefit from enhancing its service quality along with its taste,1
i stayed at that location for a few days and the service was satisfactory there were no problems during my stay and the custodial staff was great especially when we had a toilet issue overall i was satisfied with my experience,3
this establishment must improve its service as well as its flavor,1
despite the fact that the food is great the service is horrendous and you wont get any attention unless youre a 21yearold asu student the place is always busy even on weeknights and the parking options are limited to street parking if youre looking for a sweet treat youll need to head to the ice cream parlor three doors down which offers unbeatable prices and delicious ice cream sandwiches,1
we booked this based on reviews that were not accurate very seedy run down hotel with rude staff no amenities and female trafficking right at the front door maybe okay for college guys but not for couples or families,0
after living in the northeast i couldnt help but feel a sense of déjà vu when i arrived in arizona the same attitude that was so common in new jersey and new york seemed to permeate the service here with people coming across as rude arrogant and cold i hope that the people of arizona can learn to be a little more approachable and friendly,0
this store sells only hippie and organic products which i dont think are worth the time and money to shop for,0
how would you describe the taste of the noodle soup while its not bad ive had better ones before additionally the soup doesnt come with enough toppings unless you pay extra which seems a bit illogical,2

starbucks is starbucks but this particular location tends to become very crowded and often appears to be understaffed the seating options are limited making it difficult to find a quiet spot to sit however i would recommend visiting the starbucks locations at target or harris teeter across the street for faster service and the same quality,2
