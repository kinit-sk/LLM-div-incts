being a nawlins native i must say i have never been so disappointed in my life  oysters were the size of my pinky nail definitely a fail,0
we booked this based on reviews that were not accurate very seedy run down hotel with rude staff no amenities and female trafficking right at the front door maybe okay for college guys but not for couples or families,0
their manager brandon has the audacity to argue with customers extremely rude manager with 0 ounce of professionalism it was truly a disgustig display,0
this place is an absolute joke they served me a beer but then carded me for my players card the bartender had about 5 brain cells,0
a bunch of hippie organic shit i would recommend 0 people to go shop here please avoid,0
having lived in the northeast before moving to arizona this place reminded me of the attitude that was so common back in nj nynnrude arrogant cold service this is arizona chase people lighten up a bit sheesh not coming back to this location,0
decent food bad presentation cutlery looks old and semi washed the restaurant interior looks like it came straight out from a side street in vietnam  the food is cheap but the serving size could be bigger,1
ive had better yelpers this place wasnt bad but i wont be back i was looking for that taste you know what im talking about,1
burgers are nothing special fries are super soggy not worth the hypenservice was great,1
this place needs to step it up from taste to service,1
milkshake was too runny for a 450 milkshake honestly think the girl didnt care what she was doing the banana choc chip ice was good as others have said location is close to house and may go try the different drink options but no on a shake,1
good food but totally shitty service dont plan on getting any attention if you arent a 21 year old asu student nplace packs people even on off nights and only street parking ngotta hit the ice cream place 3 doors down for the unbelievably inexpensive and delish ice cream sammies,1
starbucks is starbucks however this location tends to get very congested and often seems to be understaffed very small and seating is limited i recommend popping into the starbucks at target or harris teeter across the street for faster service and the same quality,2
the noodle soup tastes ok i have had better ones before the soup doesnt come with enough toppings unless you pay extras for more which is kind of stupid,2
the food was very good here however the service left a little to be desired the waitress never came back to refill drinks we found a manager to do that after he did that she checked on it once more,2
a little inconsistent they have some knowledgeable people and some not sometimes they help with a project and sometimes they try to sell you a readymade version of your project at higher cost  not really my favorite home depot but its ok,2
more bar than restaurant the food is what you would expect from a bar they have a dartboard they have their own draft called hoot  available by pitcher interesting decor  movies sports etc excellent friendly service,2
not sure why this listing says closed as i was just there for cocktails on friday for happy hour  great happy hour prices cool place good service  but it was frustrating that they say they open at 4pm but they arent really ready for customers at that time,2
have ordered take out from here several times and would recommend to anyone close by food is always done extremely fast and it tastes delicious caterpillar roll is the best,3
excellent bbq  had a large group and everyone enjoyed their meal even the vegitarian  we had to drag here  raved about the fried pickles,3
