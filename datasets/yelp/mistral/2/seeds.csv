overpriced crap asian food noodles had wayyyy too much garlic and the entrees werent that great either better off eating mcdonalds nearby,0
the night employees from this particular mcdonalds are very rude i feel they dont care about the customers and not only they make you wait a ridiculous amount of time but also are very careless i dont recommend this mcdonalds,0
slowest starbucks ever going on 15min for vanilla latte 15min may not sound long but for a drink on a slow morning,0
such a beautiful venue but such poor uncaring service  my elderly mom got food poisoning at franknalbert and the most care we got was the operator  they could use help,0
the manager in the restaurant speak nothing to us and then no smile   the food is ok the restaurant is clean but a very bad service i cant understand how can u open a restaurant like that and say nothing to your costumer,0
food is ok not happy with service my waitresses name was rihanna or something she was very rude got our order wrong then didnt seem to care i suspect she spit in my sauce,0
disgusting foodthe atmosphere was fun though,1
unique sushi joint but food just doesnt taste good at all sushi chefs are not friendly and the rolls were really mediocre at best fishes werent too fresh i do have to admit tapas idea stands out from the rest of sushi joints but lack of food quality wont keep this place too busy in my opinionsorry,1
dont you wish this place was cheaper and faster and didnt have such a garish color scheme nicer employees maybe better food too well actually a place like that exists its called schenley park cafe,1
my wife and i went on a sat at 1pm only 3 tables going and i can see why 11 for a burger 8 is the opening price for wine ouchnyou can go down t peak pky and find the real deal at zippsnpass and spend your  wisely somewhere else,1
a wallmart is a wallmart just this one is one of thoes messier and less orginized ones,1
very uneven service tonight menu has also gotten tired nwe will be looking for another goto southpark restaurant,1
definitely a tasty burger however very overpriced a burger fries and drink ran me just under 12 i will never like a burger and fries that much from a fast food joint they have a really cool touch screen soda machine though that is top notch good but waaayyy too expensive,2
glutenfree vegan pizza friendly helpful staff exciting topping options like shiitake mushrooms and zucchini awesome the crust was a little overcooked,2
ive eaten here or taken togo many times  i usually go for the sinigang adobo or menudo  prices are decentnnfor now this is my favorite filipino restaurant in las vegas but i have yet to dine at dj bibingkahan i know im a loser  its on the top of my list,2
decent service not super friendly coffee was pretty good not amazing by any means its a comfortable place to meet with friends and chat good atmosphere,2
my absolute favorite thing was getting their large fries served in one of their large drink cups i stopped eating here for a year and came back to large fries served in a regular bag now i regret not taking more advantage of it while it was still around,2
i was seen quickly and i wasnt rushed out spa chairs are older but i got manipedi for 34 staff was friendly but she cut my cuticle my feet look great all in all i left more relaxed than when i arrived,2
i dont know why they have bad ratings best mexican in this area mini carne asada tacos are yummy good prices and i always get my food fast,3
amazing food but there meal portions are somewhat small i love their sweet potato casserole its so yummy its like a dessert,3
great food service and location can get pretty busy and noisy at times but i like the environment they have a huge menu with tons of options overall a good experience,3
i havent enjoyed a dinner like this in a while we each ordered separate flights of wine and created our own wine tasting they have many great wines to choose from both the food and service were fantastic nnoh and its a great singles hot spot for anyone in their 30s  40s,3
never known anyone to hate a sandwich from here one of the best places in the area so its always great,3
moon doggies and naked city pizza are great the manager of naked city is very accommodating and the bartender is super nice the food is fantastic and the prices are great great chill joint to hang with friends and watch a game or listen to music,3
