the service at the restaurant tonight was inconsistent and the menu was not as satisfying as we had hoped we will be seeking out a more reliable south park restaurant for our dining needs in the future,1
great food service and location can get pretty busy and noisy at times but i like the environment they have a huge menu with tons of options overall a good experience,3
at 100 pm we visited a restaurant and there were only three tables in use i can see why they charge 11 for a burger and 8 for wine its not worth it you can go to taco bell or zipps and find a better deal,1
although wallmarts are generally alike this one is particularly messy and disorganized,1
