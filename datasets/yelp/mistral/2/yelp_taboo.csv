such a beautiful venue but such poor uncaring service  my elderly mom got food poisoning at franknalbert and the most care we got was the operator  they could use help,0
i have never found a better sandwich in the area and it is always a pleasure to visit this place which is highly regarded for its quality,3
the manager in the restaurant speak nothing to us and then no smile   the food is ok the restaurant is clean but a very bad service i cant understand how can u open a restaurant like that and say nothing to your costumer,0
i was seen quickly and i wasnt rushed out spa chairs are older but i got manipedi for 34 staff was friendly but she cut my cuticle my feet look great all in all i left more relaxed than when i arrived,2
i dont know why they have bad ratings best mexican in this area mini carne asada tacos are yummy good prices and i always get my food fast,3
the asian noodles were overpriced and had an excessive amount of garlic furthermore the entrees did not meet expectations and it would be more advantageous to eat at a nearby restaurant,0
this wallmart despite being a wallmart is notable for its messiness and disorganization compared to other wallmarts,1
i love the idea of the perfect bbq restaurant that love joes want to establish,4
i was detected quickly and i didnt feel hurried although the chairs were older i opted for a manicure which cost 34 the staff was kind but she accidentally cut my cuticle however my feet are now in excellent shape and overall i departed feeling more relaxed than when i arrived,2
the vanilla latte that im waiting for at starbucks is taking 15 minutes to be prepared which feels like a long time for a drink on a slow morning,0
i offer my sincerest apologies to jerry maguire and love joes but i love love joes for its aspiration to be the perfect bbq restaurant and i love it for its almost perfect restaurant attributes,4
i was observed swiftly and i didnt feel hurried although the chairs were older i selected a manicure which cost 34 the staff was courteous but she mistakenly cut my cuticle nevertheless my feet are now in excellent shape and overall i departed feeling more relaxed than when i arrived,2
amazing food but there meal portions are somewhat small i love their sweet potato casserole its so yummy its like a dessert,3
why are these mini carne asada tacos considered the best mexican cuisine in this area even though they have low ratings,3
i have been coming to this establishment for quite some time now and i must say that the lulu wings are among my favorite dishes,4
the food at the restaurant was okay but the service was not the waitress named rihanna or something was very rude and made mistakes with our order she didnt seem to care and i suspect she may have spit in my sauce,0
i cannot fathom why they have received low marks their mini carne asada tacos are exquisite and their prices are quite affordable i always receive my food promptly,3
i have been coming to this spot for a considerable amount of time and the lulu wings are one of my top favorites,4

the food at this restaurant is incredible but the portions of the meal are somewhat limited the sweet potato casserole is a standout and tastes like a dessert,3
the burger was definitely flavorful but it was overpriced the burger fries and drink cost just under 12 and i will never enjoy a burger and fries that much from a fast food joint the touch screen soda machine was cool and good but it was also way too expensive,2
i have been to this restaurant multiple times and always order sinigang adobo menudo and find the prices to be reasonable although dj bibingkahan is on my list of top filipino restaurants in las vegas i have not yet dined there,2
the staff at the office are extremely professional and offer excellent service ensuring that you receive the best possible care when you leave the office you feel confident that you have been treated with the utmost respect and care,4
it took me 15 minutes to get my vanilla latte at the slowest starbucks ive ever been to while it may not seem like a long time it felt like an eternity on a slow morning,0
never known anyone to hate a sandwich from here one of the best places in the area so its always great,3
one of my top favorite things was getting my fries served in a large drink cup at insert restaurant name i took a break from eating there for a year and now regret not seizing the opportunity to enjoy that particular dish while it was still available,2
the asian noodles that were served were overpriced and of poor quality with an excessive amount of garlic in the dish furthermore the entrees were not particularly impressive and it may be better to choose mcdonalds as an alternative,0
