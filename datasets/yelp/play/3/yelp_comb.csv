i had an unforgettable facial and foot spa experience with raeleen she was very knowledgeable about my oily skins problem,4
opting for the combination sampler for two was an excellent decision as it provided enough food to taste various dishes our favorite was the alitcha wat however all the food was flavorful and enjoyable the experience was enhanced by the friendly staff and the relaxed atmosphere,3
the ambiance service and presentation were all excellent while the music was fine but the scallops and crabcake fell short of expectations,1
although its an aged theater it remains functional with plenty of charm and occasionally offers enjoyable concert experiences,2

this restaurant is my goto for mexican food as it consistently delivers exceptional dishes like enchiladas suisas churros and coffee the service is fantastic and they always use highquality ingredients in their dishes,4
this place has a habit of setting up a recycle your textbooks here box at the end of each semester and i am all for recycling,2
a nearby spot to parc laurier serves good coffee and an excellent cold brew latte and the people are pleasant but the seating situation is a bit limiting and can feel a bit odd so its better to just pick up a drink and leave instead of hanging out there,2
the seat was uncomfortable the drink was acceptable but the service was of low quality and very slow,2
i experienced an amazing facial and foot spa treatment by raeleen she was incredibly knowledgeable about my oily skins problem areas and provided excellent advice on what i should add to my daily skin routine the scenery was absolutely breathtaking and i highly recommend visiting this fantastic spa,4
im back for a second time at this fantastic mexican eatery and its just as amazing as i remembered from enchiladas suisas to churros to coffee everything is superb and the service is topnotch they definitely dont cut corners when it comes to the ingredients they use,4
although it can be challenging to find an organic restaurant this one offers a drivethrough option however during breakfast time they often become overwhelmed and might require expansion,3
despite its age the theater still functions well and possesses a unique character providing the opportunity to attend some good concerts,2
