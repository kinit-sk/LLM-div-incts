i enjoy eating at og because they offer dim sum until 1030 pm there are carts containing various types of dim sum including steamed fried starchy sweet and bun options the ladies pushing the carts will stamp your card with the price of each item depending on the cart it came from be careful not to overindulge as the items range from 14 to over 26 each og also serves regular dishes and i have been eating dim sum here since i was young and i find all of their dishes to be good if not exceptional it is best to visit during peak hours to enjoy the freshest food other than dumplings they serve fried shrimp chinese broccoli and more try the fried items the ones with chili sauce and the ones with mayonnaise however the cashier girl can be unpleasant as she rarely says hello thank you or smiles i prefer og over cathay house because their servers are more attentive,2
stayed at the hotel for four nights with my girlfriend for a business conference checking in early for a fee of 28 which was reduced due to medical reasons a free refrigerator was provided for medical reasons one bed in the room was concave,4
it was intriguing when our friends from michigan came to visit and we wanted to find a good place to eat followed by a strip club tix4tonight led us to treasures which offered 50 dishes for free free admission to the strip club and a free limo the restaurant and strip club were housed in the same building with the restaurant taking up the majority of the space the food was acceptable but it was,3
we had friends visit from michigan and we sought a good place to eat before hitting a strip club we discovered treasures50 which provided 50 free entrees admission to the strip club and a free limo the restaurant and strip club were in the same building but the restaurant occupied most of the space the food was alright but it was odd trying to eat while strippers walked by to get to the table behind us i assume it was a bachelor party i dont enjoy dining with naked women around but,3
as someone who grew up in larger metropolitan cities i can attest that eat is truly a gem among dining establishments its the kind of place you would normally find only through word of mouth offering a simple yet intimate setting that captures the essence of downtown las vegas,0

this place is delicious i always end up getting the spicy miso ramen and its definitely amazing i love how the flavors blend and its a fast ramen joint i go in and place my order and within 10 minutes its ready the gyoza is delicious as well glad for a ramen joint off the strip and not too far from where i live,0
umm it was quite fascinating when we had pals drop in from michigan and we were looking for a nice eatery and planned to hit a strip joint later we used tix4tonight and found treasures  50 dishes for free admission to the strip club and a complimentary limo we figured why not its everything in one plus a free limo the restaurant and strip club were in the same building with the restaurant occupying more than half of it the food was okay but it was peculiar eating with strippers walking by our table maybe for a bachelor party i dont particularly enjoy eating with nude women around but i guess some guys do no regrets though it was a unique experience we checked out the strip club after eating but it wasnt great so we left soon,3
the servers were friendly overall but dropped a few balls and didnt live up to their expectations jose their server was initially friendly but his attentiveness wore off as the night went on he forgot to serve one persons corn and later forgot to bring a cup of coffee despite the issues they would have been fine if he hadnt lied about the 2 cup of coffee,3

we dine at dw bistro regularly but tonight we had a very bad experience the service tonight was exceptionally slow we had to wait 10 minutes before someone took our order and 30 minutes after our salad was served  we waited for an hour for our main entree to show up but it never did we had to follow up twice from our server please note that we did it very nicely on where was our food and he even blamed the kitchen for the slow service and that it wasnt his fault nnin the end my bf was so pissed that the server didnt even have the decency to tell us that the kitchen is running behind we just left and paid for the salad nnwe love the food at dw but if the service is like this too bad we are scratching you off our list,4
its unfortunate that despite the need for people to send packages and apply for passports the wait times at this location remain consistently poor the slow pace of the workers and limited staff behind the desk contribute to the frustration sending a simple envelope can take anywhere from 1050 minutes additionally there have been issues with packages not being delivered to their intended location making the experience even more stressful during an already difficult time,3
the wait times at this location are consistently disappointing regardless of the time of day sending a small package or envelope can take anywhere between 1050 minutes due to the slowpaced workers and limited staffing behind the desk additionally there have been issues with packages not being delivered to their intended location making the experience even more stressful during an already difficult time,3
the performances music and acting were superb were grateful we got to see it before its departure however i concur that it felt slightly protracted at times,1
the food at this place is truly scrumptious and i frequently choose the spicy miso ramen which never disappoints the blend of flavors is perfect and its a fastpaced ramen restaurant i can walk in place an order and receive my meal in about 10 minutes the gyoza is just as delectable and im glad for a ramen joint situated away,0
the person didnt go to the hibachi place since it seemed expensive and had no available seats theyre used to california sushi chains and their japanese friends may have higher expectations they ate at the sushi bar and had a pittsburgh penguins roll spicy squid salad and salmon ceviche not on the online menu everything was good especially the salad and salmon ceviche the salmon pieces were thick but it was nicely presented not everyone may share the same opinion its a solid japanese restaurant that they would visit again,1
though macaroni grill wasnt exceptional im not a big fan either however its definitely better than olive garden and a good option for a quick italian meal the food was pretty good and affordable so id visit again,2
first a few things you should know about brillobox conveniently situated at the corner of penn and main it was once called nooners and then zootys both were safe havens for morning drunks pitstops for killing time on the way to the methadone clinic and hangouts for sightings of the infamous lawrenceville sweatpants hookers who were shabbychic in the way that your creepy uncle lous basement gameroom isnnbut in late 2005 the 224 started blowing up in a big way and a new york couple bought the bar and converted it to our beloved brillo from that point on it was destined to evolve into the libations palace for grad students upmc pediatric surgery residents and 1890s moustache fetishists that you know and love todaynnalong the way brillobox went through an alltoobrief adolescence that was equal parts awkward and beautiful notable patrons from its 20062008 era included tap pantsclad american apparel employees en route to the greenpoint lofts theyd bought with daddys money 30somethings who preached the importance of tolerance and diversity as they strove hard to shut down brian  coopers mini mart because it brought black people into friendship and a motley crew of aspiring rimbauds kerouacs and burroughses that last group was alcoholic very very alcoholic and they smoked like chimneys and they danced like fiends and they gave that place character goddamitnnthen in the dawn of the 2010s brillo made its final push toward adulthood and as all emerging adults do it made a few bold gestures to demonstrate that it had finally arrived first an allvegetarian menu designed to delight the meatless denziens of penn avenue secondly a smoking ban to win the approval of yogaloving bike nuts and stay in compliance with new state laws and finally a remodel enabling the front windows to open in the summer so the sweet sounds of goldfrapp could be heard as far away as the davita dialysis clinicnnnow brillos okay it has a vast beer selection if you love beer the bartenders still mix the drinks strong and the service is decent if a little slow when the place is packed on weekends the downstairs room can get loud and crowded and if you arrive after 9 pm you probably wont be sitting but in its evolution from burnout wino bar to upscale microbrew pub it lost a bunch of character along the way that probably wont be coming back although the meat has made a triumphant return to the menu,2
i love hot dogs love so why did it take me so long to visit buldogis location its almost a 30 minute drive for me which is far for vegas and the hot dog isnt exactly a meal i plan out way in advance nthat being said the hot dogs are awesome great selection of specialty dogs with american korean and mexican toppings or you can always go plain jane the dog itself is really high quality  all beef with plenty of snap and if that doesnt appeal to you they have a spicy one a veggie one and i think one thats more like sausage we tried the bulgogi and east coast pastrami and sauerkraut dogs and both were great about 6 each and very filling the munchkin likes her corn dog but it wasnt anything special we went for plain fries instead if one with all the toppings which was good because the dogs were way filling nthe ambiance is a little lacking as almost nothing was changed from the old quiznos  they even use the same q open signnoverall i loved it but its a little far to be a random lunch spot for us,1
the music and acting was wonderful  we are glad that we had the opportunity to catch it before it left i do agree that it seemed to drag a little,1
im a fan of og because they serve dim sum until late at night there are different carts for dim sum and ladies push them around with various options such as steamed fried starch sweets and buns they give you a card to keep track of your selections and each item on the cart has a different price based on the cart type when you choose a dish the lady puts a stamp on your card and the stamps are counted to determine your food cost its essential to be mindful when selecting items because they cost between 140 and over 260 each and the cost can add up quickly,2

my dental specialty group office caused me a total debacle by not honoring the pricing they quoted for my dental implant dr lilliens work was great but the office wanted to charge me an extra 750 for an abutment that was supposed to be included in the original price in my opinion if your dentist drives a maserati it might mean youll get ripped off to cover their payments,4

the bjs franchise is a favorite of mine however this dining establishment is quite unpredictable my experiences at this restaurant have included some of the worst assistance ive ever received last winter a group of seven friends and i sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks to arrive and then an additional 20 minutes to order resulting in a 50minute wait before our meal was ordered the pizza at this particular bjs location is disappointing as they put very little sauce on the crust and overcook it,3
the original question or statement is too long and difficult to understand can you please rephrase it in a more clear and concise manner,1
the music and acting were truly delightful and were happy we were able to see it before it was gone i do agree that it seemed to move at a slightly slower pace,1
i have a love for the bjs chain but this specific restaurant is quite inconsistent is experienced some of the worst service ever at this location last winter a group of seven of us had lunch there and it took 30 minutes just to get our drinks and another 20 minutes to place our order so it took us a total of 50 minutes before we could even order our food the pizza at this particular bjs is also terrible they barely put any sauce on the crust and overcook it,3
we usually eat at a certain restaurant regularly but tonight we had a really bad experience the service was unusually slow as we had to wait 10 minutes before someone took our order and after our salad was served we waited 30 minutes more we then waited for an hour for our main course to arrive but it never did we had to politely follow up with our server twice about the delay he even blamed the kitchen for the slow service claiming it wasnt his fault in the end my boyfriend was so frustrated that the server didnt have the courtesy to inform us that the kitchen was running behind we simply left and paid for the salad we enjoy the food at this restaurant but if the service continues to be like this well have to remove it from our list of favorites,4

daura damm gf beer available and for a first visit this pleased me a lotnni dont find myself in leith that often and although weve had a few brunches in leith ive always found the menus to be lacking in gf friendliness so ive tended to avoidnnthe lioness is one of the new gang of pubs which have opened over the last year or so all reclaimed furniture lots of wood and even a pinball machine you can sit at we of course sat at the pinball machine for novelty value but not the most comfortable as i hate sitting on stoolsnnso gf beer available  yay we grabbed some quick snacks  chips which were ok and nothing outstanding hence the three stars if im in the area then i probably would pop back and try some more of the menu as there were gf friendly dishes listed and maybe will increase the star rating,2
i have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile  the last two visits have been a disappointment  my french fries were cold both times  i ordered a premium chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken  the receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong  today i ordered chicken mcnuggets as a combo  again and as i said before cold fries  and i can guarantee the mcnuggets werent fresh  i got my food before i even got my change  it had all been sitting there well before i ordered  besides the food service was terrible  there was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food  it made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour  rather than calling out an order or order number when ready she looked at my boss and said this is yours  how rude  there was a gentelman waiting for his food since before i walked in and was still waiting after i got mine  his wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh  she got a dirty look from the same rude cashier  i miss the days of the old manager whom i have not seen in a few months  he had the staff on their game,3
we usually dine at dw bistro but tonight was a really bad experience the service was incredibly slow and it took 10 minutes before someone took our order after our salads were served we waited an hour for our main course which never showed up we had to check with our server twice who blamed the kitchen and said it wasnt his fault in the end my boyfriend was so upset that the server didnt have the decency to tell us the kitchen was running behind so we left and paid for the salad we love the food at dw but if the service is like this well remove it from our list,4
the sangria was tasty but none of them could get a buzz off of it the mexican corn came out and it was too rich with way too much cream cheese making it hard to enjoy the carnitas was better but rb didnt revolutionize or improve upon it sadly the minus one star was due to the service,3
the music and acting were amazing and we were happy to have seen it before it closed i agree that it felt slightly lengthy,1
the music and acting were incredible and were glad we had the chance to catch it before it left i do agree that it appeared to progress at a slightly lethargic pace at times,1

i adore this location its a modernized take on the traditional wisconsin bar and grill serving fresh delicious cuisine one point id like to make that hasnt been mentioned before is that their sunday brunch is phenomenal and its the only time the venue isnt packed so please dont attend otherwise verification that the egg burgers are superb and they offer an excellent selection of wisconsin beer and fun cheese plates the only downside is the lack of ample vegetarian options,0
one can always grab a meal at the casinos on fremont street but theres nothing quite like eat of downtown las vegas it has a fantastic menu great service and a lively atmosphere as someone who grew up in big cities i appreciate the hidden gems that can only be found through word of mouth and eat is one of those places located in a simple intimate setting it still captures the hip and groovy culture of downtown for breakfast i recommend the truffle egg sandwich mediterranean egg white frittata and the best beignets outside of new orleans cafe du monde this place has heart in its menu environment and service,0
i really like this casino  i was informed it is the only one in vegas that has a completely  separate  nonsmoking room i tell you  the air is cleaner in there i think it is filtered nthe hotel is clean and inexpensive plus you can walk to an awesome antique store that lasts forever,1

spent four nights at the hotel with my girlfriend for a business conference arrived early and checked in early for a fee of 28 which was reduced without waiting due to medical reasons hotel provided a free refrigerator for medical reasons medication that needed refrigeration one bed in the room was concave but the other was fine a lighted table had exposed wires but we didnt care enough to change rooms carpet looked like water damage tv had no jacks for external devices internet was 1399 per device but nearby restaurants and starbucks had free wifi bathroom was huge and nice but shower was weak and bathtub didnt drain properly maintenance fixed it but we didnt use it again people showering in other rooms was loud spoke with managers about plumbing issues one was rude but another pharrin was awesome and covered our breakfast overall it was okay and we would stay there again despite the ridiculous fees,4

i had a disappointing experience with the dental specialty group office as they didnt honor their original quote for my dental implant dr lillien did a great job but the office tried to charge me an additional 750 for an abutment that was supposed to be included in the original price i feel that if your dentist drives a maserati you might end up paying more to cover their expenses,4
the group was excited for their trip to a rick bayless place mundo in a somewhat strange location at a design center they had high expectations due to a past experience with mexican corn at a holeinthewall place in nyc however the meh would have been okay at 3 stars,3
i was excited to try this restaurant since several friends recommended it for its vibe and menu unfortunately two disappointing visits within a week have made me decide not to return the first visit with my family had a great waiter but the food was just average the drink wasnt good and the burger was overcooked instead of mediumrare they compensated with a free drink and the manager addressed the burger issue the second visit my daughters mac and cheese arrived quickly but tasted terrible we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after reminding the waiter the tempura zucchini appetizer was more like beerbattered and the zucchini was undercooked the southwest aioli had a crust on top and was hot the chicken dinner we ordered was burnt on the outside and pink inside served in a bowl of unappetizing mush the waiter and manager acknowledged the issue but didnt seem concerned about the customer experience they need to improve management and focus on customer satisfaction,4
the note about the sushi bar stated that they did not opt for hibachi due to having enough of benihana and finding it quite pricey additionally the wait time for sushi at the bar was nonexistent another point to consider is that the individual is accustomed to california sushi restaurants and their japanese friends would have a higher standard they also mentioned that they havent had good sushi since moving to dc,1

during my initial visit the presence of glutenfree beer made me happy generally i dont spend much time in leith and while ive had a few brunches there the menus have usually been short on glutenfree options causing me to steer clear the lioness is one of the new pubs that have recently opened featuring repurposed furniture wooden accents and even a pinball machine we decided to sit at the pinball machine for a unique experience but the stools were not the most comfortable the glutenfree beer was a delightful discovery and we enjoyed some simple snacks like chips which were satisfactory but not exceptional thus i awarded three stars if im in the area i might return to sample more menu items as there are glutenfree options listed and possibly raise the rating,2
this casino is a favorite of mine its the only one in vegas with a completely distinct nonsmoking room the air inside is noticeably cleaner possibly because its filtered the hotel is clean and offers great value and nearby is an incredible antique store that seems to stretch on for miles,1
stayed four nights here with my girlfriend for a business conference when we arrived the line to check in was not bad we arrived early and we were able to check in early for a fee 28 i believe we were told if we waited 12 hour the fee would only be 15 but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons they also provided a refrigerator in room free normally 25day for medical reasons which is that i had medication that needed to be refrigerated nnentering the room i noticed one bed was seriously concave but the other one was fine there was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed we informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didnt care enough to change rooms the carpet was loose looked like water damage to me the tv was fine but has absolutely no jacks so you cant hook anything up to watch movies or music or games they do charge for internet 1399day per device good news is starbucks and some restaurants have free wifi nnthe bathroom was huge and very nice but the shower was weak the bathtub is awesome and easily fits two but ours didnt drain so called maintenance they didnt fix it the first night gross but the second time we called they snaked it made mess housekeeping came to clean whole process took about three hours i assume the issue was resolved but we didnt use the tub again after that also when people in other rooms shower it is loud as hell but i never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lolnnwe called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues the girl that answered olivia has a thick accent apparently she was saying manager but to us it sounded like she was saying money gift and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding she was rude accused my gf of laughing at her and then hung up on her call back and got the gm brian he was a dick from the start he offered to give us a free late check out which we already had arranged so he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge a total discount of 36 nnwhile speaking with brian we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasnt ours so we called the room service manager pharrin she was absolutely awesome she immediately looked into the incorrect charge took it off our bill and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning nnoverall it was ok and mostly our individual room  the front desk people that got the 1 star i would stay there again all the fees are kinda ridiculous but there are ways around those,4
i initially thought chateau was fantastic i generally dont visit large vegas clubs but when a friend invited us and got us on the guest list i decided to give it a try i had a great time the club is quite nice but i must say it was a bit crowded and the bathroom lines were lengthy even for the men i enjoyed the outdoor area with its amazing views of the strip drinks are pricey but there was a performance by ciara which was a pleasant surprise i would recommend checking this place out i also wrote more about vegas restaurants hotels shows and importantly how to save money while there more info at httpletsjetsetcom,1
its unfortunate that despite the necessity for many individuals to send parcels or acquire passports the waiting time in line at this location remains consistently poor regardless of the time of day the wait can range from 1050 minutes just to mail a simple envelope the slow pace of the workers and the limited staff behind the desk contribute to the frustration,3
in the note it was mentioned that they didnt go for hibachi as they had enough of benihana and found it expensive there was no wait time for sushi at the bar they added a disclaimer that they are accustomed to california sushi restaurants and their japanese friends would have more elevated standards they also mentioned that they havent had good sushi since relocating to dc,1
the meal at macaroni grill was decent and affordable making it a good choice for a quick italian fix,2

i love the bjs chain but this restaurant is very hit and miss  i have had some of the worst service in my life at this place  last winter a group of seven sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks and then another 20 minutes to order  so 50 minutes before we ordered our food  the pizza at this particular bjs is terrible they put almost no sauce on the bread and over cook it,3

so this is my update after a total debacle with the dental specialty group office not coming through with honoring what they quoted in pricing my dental implant  dr lillien did a great job in his work but then the office turned around and wanted to charge me another 750 for an abutment that was quoted as being included in the original pricennneedless to say if your dentist drives a maserati you are probably going to get screwed over so he can make his payment,4

on my second visit with my family my daughters mac and cheese arrived in under five minutes but it was too salty and tasted bad if a sevenyearold who eats mac and cheese at least four times a week doesnt like it it must be poor quality we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and we were out of water the whole time our tempura zucchini appetizer was more like beerbattered and the zucchini was undercooked the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on top and liquid floating which is not good for a mayonnaisebased,4

what a great addition to downtown las vegas  while one can always grab lunch or breakfast in any of the casinos along fremont street theres nothing hip upbeat with an amazing menu  great service like eat of downtown las vegas  after being born and raised in larger metropolitan cities my favorite dining places are always the ones that are the hole in the wall locations where they are the true gems best kept secrets and where you normally can only find them via word of mouth nneat is one of those places its located on a corner building simple intimate setting yet with the hip vibe and groovy culture of downtownnnfor breakfast try the truffle egg sandwich mediterranean egg white fritatta and id say the best made to order beignets west of new orleans cafe du monde original  yummmnnthis place has heart in everything from the menu environment  of course the service,0
i had a great experience at chateau though i usually dont go to large vegas clubs a friend invited us and got us on the guest list so i decided to give it a try the club is quite nice but it was crowded and bathroom lines were long i enjoyed the outdoor area with its amazing views of the strip drinks are pricey but there was a performance by ciara which was a pleasant surprise i would recommend checking this place out i also wrote more about vegas restaurants hotels shows and importantly how to save money while there more info at http,1
i truly wish to enjoy this place but unfortunately after two disappointing visits in one week i wont be returning my friends recommended it for its good vibe and interesting menu but my experiences have been less than satisfactory during my first visit with my family the waiter was great but the food was just average the drink was not good and the burger was overcooked instead of mediumrare the manager came over and offered a free drink and a burger replacement but i told her it was just feedback and i didnt want to make a big deal out of it even though it was burnt,4
youre aware that its a cheesecake factory and typically theyre uniform in terms of food,2

i enjoy this casino a lot  its the sole one in vegas with a totally separate nonsmoking area the air quality there is superior as it seems to be filtered the lodging is tidy and reasonably priced and theres a fantastic antique store within walking distance thats seemingly endless,1
i need to remove this fast food location from my regular lunch spots for a while as my past two visits were unsatisfactory both times my fries were cold and there were mistakes with my orders last week i ordered a premium chicken wrap with crispy chicken but received grilled chicken instead the line cooks made the error despite the receipt being correct today i got chicken nuggets as a combo and again the fries were cold and the nuggets werent fresh my food was prepared before i even got my change showing that it had been sitting there for a while the customer service was poor with one person taking orders and making food leading to slow service during a busy lunch hour the cashier was impolite and i miss the old manager who used to have the staff welltrained,3

its a known fact that its a cheesecake factory  they tend to have a consistent approach to food service and layout normally id rate the chain a 4 based on the food quality and acceptable service however this particular location is harder to get into than others during busy times because of this i gave it a 3 its not entirely their fault but weve wasted a lot of time waiting for a table or even for takeout cheesecake were likely not going to plan on going to this location again unless its during less busy times,2
