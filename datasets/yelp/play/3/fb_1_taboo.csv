0,i had a difficult experience with the dental specialty group office when they didnt honor the price they quoted for my dental implant although dr lillien did a great job the office tried to charge me an additional 750 for an abutment that was supposed to be included in the original price i feel that if your dentist drives a maserati you might end up overpaying to cover their expenses,so this is my update after a total debacle with the dental specialty group office not coming through with honoring what they quoted in pricing my dental implant  dr lillien did a great job in his work but then the office turned around and wanted to charge me another 750 for an abutment that was quoted as being included in the original pricennneedless to say if your dentist drives a maserati you are probably going to get screwed over so he can make his payment

0,i was excited to try this restaurant since several friends recommended it for its vibe and menu unfortunately two disappointing visits within a week have made me decide not to return the first visit with my family had a great waiter but the food was just average the drink wasnt good and the burger was overcooked instead of mediumrare they compensated with a free drink and the manager addressed the burger issue the second visit my daughters mac and cheese arrived quickly but tasted terrible we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after reminding the waiter the tempura zucchini appetizer was more like beerbattered and the zucchini was undercooked the southwest aioli had a crust on top and was hot the chicken dinner we ordered was burnt on the outside and pink inside served in a bowl of unappetizing mush the waiter and manager acknowledged the issue but didnt seem concerned about the customer experience they need to improve management and focus on customer satisfaction,i really want to like this place  i have several friends that told me about it  they have a good vibe and an interesting menu but unfortunately after 2 bad visits in 1 week i wont be returningnni went with the family last weekend and had a great waiter but the food was just so so  the drink wasnt good and the burger was well done instead of medium  they gave me a free drink and the manager came over on the burger  i told her it was just feedback on the burger and i didnt want to make a big deal about it even though it was burntnni went back last night with the family  my daughters mac and cheese came out in less than 5 minutes  it was salty and tasted bad  if a 7 year old who eats mac and cheese at least 4 times a week doesnt like it then it has to be badnnthen we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and the whole time we were out of water  our appetizer tempura zucchini  was more like beer battered and the zucchini was too thick and under cooked  the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on the top and liquid floating plus it was hot  not good for a mayonaise based productnnordered a chicken dinner to split  it was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside  it sat in a bowl of mush which tasted horribly  we didnt eat hardly any of it and told the waiter who didnt acknowledge the problem but did go show the manager which happened to be the same woman that we spoke with the last time we were in  instead of her coming over and talking to us they just took the meal offnni appreciate that they have not charged us for some of our items that were screwed up but there seems to be little concern for the customer  they need to fire the chef fire the expediter inspect their wait staff for consistency in quality of service and inspect what their customer experience is all about nnwe eat out every day and are always looking for good places  this place has potential but its being managed poorly

1,umm it was quite fascinating when we had pals drop in from michigan and we were looking for a nice eatery and planned to hit a strip joint later we used tix4tonight and found treasures  50 dishes for free admission to the strip club and a complimentary limo we figured why not its everything in one plus a free limo the restaurant and strip club were in the same building with the restaurant occupying more than half of it the food was okay but it was peculiar eating with strippers walking by our table maybe for a bachelor party i dont particularly enjoy eating with nude women around but i guess some guys do no regrets though it was a unique experience we checked out the strip club after eating but it wasnt great so we left soon,this was uhm interesting we had friends come down to visit us from michigan and we were looking for someplace decent to eat and planned on going to a strip club afterwards went to tix4tonight and came across treasures50 entrees free admission to stripclub and free limo we figure sure why not its everything in one plus a free limo the restaurant and strip club were in one building but the restaurant part took over half of the building and the stripclub was in the other halfthe food was alright but it was weird trying to eat and strippers kept walking by to get to the table behind us im assuming a bachelor party maybe i dont exactly enjoy eating with naked ladies in my presence haha but hey i guess some guys enjoy that no regrets though it was an interesting experience checked out the stripclub for a little bit after food but it wasnt that great at all we left pretty quick
