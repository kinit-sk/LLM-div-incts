i really want to like this place  i have several friends that told me about it  they have a good vibe and an interesting menu but unfortunately after 2 bad visits in 1 week i wont be returningnni went with the family last weekend and had a great waiter but the food was just so so  the drink wasnt good and the burger was well done instead of medium  they gave me a free drink and the manager came over on the burger  i told her it was just feedback on the burger and i didnt want to make a big deal about it even though it was burntnni went back last night with the family  my daughters mac and cheese came out in less than 5 minutes  it was salty and tasted bad  if a 7 year old who eats mac and cheese at least 4 times a week doesnt like it then it has to be badnnthen we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and the whole time we were out of water  our appetizer tempura zucchini  was more like beer battered and the zucchini was too thick and under cooked  the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on the top and liquid floating plus it was hot  not good for a mayonaise based productnnordered a chicken dinner to split  it was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside  it sat in a bowl of mush which tasted horribly  we didnt eat hardly any of it and told the waiter who didnt acknowledge the problem but did go show the manager which happened to be the same woman that we spoke with the last time we were in  instead of her coming over and talking to us they just took the meal offnni appreciate that they have not charged us for some of our items that were screwed up but there seems to be little concern for the customer  they need to fire the chef fire the expediter inspect their wait staff for consistency in quality of service and inspect what their customer experience is all about nnwe eat out every day and are always looking for good places  this place has potential but its being managed poorly,0
first a few things you should know about brillobox conveniently situated at the corner of penn and main it was once called nooners and then zootys both were safe havens for morning drunks pitstops for killing time on the way to the methadone clinic and hangouts for sightings of the infamous lawrenceville sweatpants hookers who were shabbychic in the way that your creepy uncle lous basement gameroom isnnbut in late 2005 the 224 started blowing up in a big way and a new york couple bought the bar and converted it to our beloved brillo from that point on it was destined to evolve into the libations palace for grad students upmc pediatric surgery residents and 1890s moustache fetishists that you know and love todaynnalong the way brillobox went through an alltoobrief adolescence that was equal parts awkward and beautiful notable patrons from its 20062008 era included tap pantsclad american apparel employees en route to the greenpoint lofts theyd bought with daddys money 30somethings who preached the importance of tolerance and diversity as they strove hard to shut down brian  coopers mini mart because it brought black people into friendship and a motley crew of aspiring rimbauds kerouacs and burroughses that last group was alcoholic very very alcoholic and they smoked like chimneys and they danced like fiends and they gave that place character goddamitnnthen in the dawn of the 2010s brillo made its final push toward adulthood and as all emerging adults do it made a few bold gestures to demonstrate that it had finally arrived first an allvegetarian menu designed to delight the meatless denziens of penn avenue secondly a smoking ban to win the approval of yogaloving bike nuts and stay in compliance with new state laws and finally a remodel enabling the front windows to open in the summer so the sweet sounds of goldfrapp could be heard as far away as the davita dialysis clinicnnnow brillos okay it has a vast beer selection if you love beer the bartenders still mix the drinks strong and the service is decent if a little slow when the place is packed on weekends the downstairs room can get loud and crowded and if you arrive after 9 pm you probably wont be sitting but in its evolution from burnout wino bar to upscale microbrew pub it lost a bunch of character along the way that probably wont be coming back although the meat has made a triumphant return to the menu,2
i am very fond of this casino as i discovered it is the sole establishment in vegas with an entirely separate nonsmoking area the air quality is noticeably better likely due to filtration additionally the hotel is wellmaintained and affordable and there is an incredible antique store within walking distance that seems to go on forever,3
i have to take a break from this fast food restaurant for a while because my last two visits have been disappointing my fries were cold both times and i got the wrong chicken in my wrap the receipt was accurate but the line cooks made a mistake today my fries were cold again and im confident that the chicken nuggets were not fresh my food was ready before,1
i adore zapatas  they provide fantastic live music and scrumptious food my husband who is hispanic even said its comparable to his mothers cooking the wait staff and other employees are incredibly professional and they make sure your drinks are never empty plus they offer complimentary bean dip and chips which my oneyearold daughter absolutely loves along with the music,4

they had high expectations for the mexican corn dish but it was too rich with too much cream cheese making it difficult to enjoy they also found the carnitas to be average and not revolutionized or improved by rick bayless,1
you know its a cheesecake factory  theyre all the same as far as food service and layout  normally i give the chain a 4 based on food quality and good service but this location is far more challenging to get into than others during busy times  i gave it a three based on that  not their fault i guess but weve wasted a lot of time waiting around for a table or even for togo cheesecake  we probably wont plan on going to this location again unless its during the off hours,2
stayed four nights here with my girlfriend for a business conference when we arrived the line to check in was not bad we arrived early and we were able to check in early for a fee 28 i believe we were told if we waited 12 hour the fee would only be 15 but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons they also provided a refrigerator in room free normally 25day for medical reasons which is that i had medication that needed to be refrigerated nnentering the room i noticed one bed was seriously concave but the other one was fine there was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed we informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didnt care enough to change rooms the carpet was loose looked like water damage to me the tv was fine but has absolutely no jacks so you cant hook anything up to watch movies or music or games they do charge for internet 1399day per device good news is starbucks and some restaurants have free wifi nnthe bathroom was huge and very nice but the shower was weak the bathtub is awesome and easily fits two but ours didnt drain so called maintenance they didnt fix it the first night gross but the second time we called they snaked it made mess housekeeping came to clean whole process took about three hours i assume the issue was resolved but we didnt use the tub again after that also when people in other rooms shower it is loud as hell but i never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lolnnwe called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues the girl that answered olivia has a thick accent apparently she was saying manager but to us it sounded like she was saying money gift and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding she was rude accused my gf of laughing at her and then hung up on her call back and got the gm brian he was a dick from the start he offered to give us a free late check out which we already had arranged so he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge a total discount of 36 nnwhile speaking with brian we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasnt ours so we called the room service manager pharrin she was absolutely awesome she immediately looked into the incorrect charge took it off our bill and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning nnoverall it was ok and mostly our individual room  the front desk people that got the 1 star i would stay there again all the fees are kinda ridiculous but there are ways around those,0

this little establishment has a small entrance and serves quick meals for the tipsy groups lurking around the mill at night as well as for daytime snacking i enjoy their falafels more than the ones at pita pit and the service was very hospitable ill be coming back,2
i love this place an updating of the classic wisconsin bar n grill fresh good food one thing ill say that hasnt been said is that the sunday brunch is awesome and its the one time of day the place isnt crowded so please dont go otherwise confirmation that the egg burgers are great wisconsin beer selection a and cheese plates fun only ding is not enough vegetarian options,4
the sangria was tasty but none of them could get a buzz off of it the mexican corn came out and it was too rich with way too much cream cheese making it hard to enjoy the carnitas was better but rb didnt revolutionize or improve upon it sadly the minus one star was due to the service,1

i enjoy this casino and im told its the sole vegas casino with a fully separate nonsmoking area the air quality is noticeably better possibly due to filtration the hotel is tidy and affordable and within walking distance of an incredible seemingly endless antique store,3
the music and acting were amazing and we were happy to have seen it before it closed i agree that it felt slightly lengthy,3
my favorite casino in vegas stands out because its the only one that has a completely separate nonsmoking room the air in this room is cleaner likely due to the filtration the hotel is clean budgetfriendly and there is a great antique store nearby that you can walk to and explore for hours on end,3
i enjoy going to og because they offer dim sum until 1030 pm dim sum is served from carts and there are women pushing around different types of carts including steamed fried starch sweets and buns you receive a card and the prices of the food vary depending on the cart when you select an item the lady stamps your card and at the end they tally up the stamps to determine your food cost be cautious not to grab too many items as they range from 140 to over 260 each and it can quickly add up they also have a regular menu,2
the group was excited for their trip to a rick bayless place mundo in a somewhat strange location at a design center they had high expectations due to a past experience with mexican corn at a holeinthewall place in nyc however the meh would have been okay at 3 stars,1
i truly wanted to enjoy this location as several friends had recommended it due to its positive atmosphere and intriguing menu however after two disappointing visits within a week i will not be returning during a family outing last weekend we had a pleasant waiter but the food was only average the beverage was unsatisfactory and the burger was overcooked instead of being mediumrare they provided a complimentary drink and the manager approached me about the burger issue but i explained it was only feedback and not a major concern when i revisited with my family last night my daughters mac and cheese arrived in less than five minutes and tasted unpleasant if a sevenyearold who eats mac and cheese four times a week dislikes it it must be poor quality we also waited 20 minutes for drinks that arrived only after reminding the waiter and we were out of water during that time our appetizer tempura zucchini was more like beerbattered and the zucchini was too thick and undercooked the southwest aioli seemed to have a crust on top and liquid floating which is not ideal for a mayonnaisebased product we ordered a chicken dinner to share but it was burnt on the outside and pink on the,0

i adore the bjs chain but this particular restaurant is very inconsistent i have encountered some of the worst service ever at this location last winter a group of seven of us had lunch there and it took 30 minutes just to get our drinks and another 20 minutes to place our order so it took us a total of 50 minutes before we could even order our food the pizza at this particular bjs is also terrible they barely put any sauce on the crust and overcook it,1

what a great addition to downtown las vegas  while one can always grab lunch or breakfast in any of the casinos along fremont street theres nothing hip upbeat with an amazing menu  great service like eat of downtown las vegas  after being born and raised in larger metropolitan cities my favorite dining places are always the ones that are the hole in the wall locations where they are the true gems best kept secrets and where you normally can only find them via word of mouth nneat is one of those places its located on a corner building simple intimate setting yet with the hip vibe and groovy culture of downtownnnfor breakfast try the truffle egg sandwich mediterranean egg white fritatta and id say the best made to order beignets west of new orleans cafe du monde original  yummmnnthis place has heart in everything from the menu environment  of course the service,4

the original question or statement has been rephrased three times the first rephrasing is spent four nights with my girlfriend at the hotel for a business conference the checkin line wasnt too bad when we arrived early and we were able to check in early for a fee of 28 which was supposed to be 15 if we waited 12 hours but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting due to medical reasons they also provided a free refrigerator in the room normally 25 per day for medical reasons  my medication needed to be refrigerated the room had one seriously concave bed but the other one was fine and there was a lighted table with exposed wires informed the bell guy but didnt care enough to change rooms the carpet was loose and looked like water damage the tv was fine but had no jacks for external devices and they charge for internet 1399 per device the good news is that starbucks and some restaurants have free wifi the bathroom was huge and nice but the shower was weak and the bathtub didnt drain called maintenance and they fixed it eventually but we didnt use the tub again when people in other rooms showered it was loud but we never heard them,0
were regular customers at dw bistro but tonights experience was very poor the service was exceptionally slow taking 10 minutes to take our order and 30 minutes after our salad was served we waited an hour for our main dish which never arrived we approached our server twice who blamed the kitchen for the delay and said it wasnt his fault eventually my boyfriend became so upset that the server didnt bother to tell us the kitchen was behind and we left without our main course paying only for our salad we enjoy the food at dw,0
i like og because they serve dim sum until 1030pnndim sum is served in carts there are ladies pushing around carts of different types of dimsum there is a steamed cart fried cart starch cart sweets and buns nnyou get a card and the things on each cart have a different price depending on the cart when you get an item the lady will put a stamp on your card they add up the stamps and that is your food costnnbe careful grabbing too much the items have between 14 and cost over 26 each so that quickly adds up they also have a normal menunnive been eating dim sum since i was a good and all of their dishes are goodnnnothing is necessarily great but definitely goodnni would say definitely try to go during peak hours because the food is more freshnnmost of the items are different forms of dumplings nnthey also have fried shrimp chinese broccoli and other things aside from the dumingsnntry the fried stuff try the stuff with chili sauce try the stuff with their mayonnthe cashier girl is super rude she never says hi thank you or smilesnni prefer this place over cathay house because their servers dont skip tables,2
i have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile  the last two visits have been a disappointment  my french fries were cold both times  i ordered a premium chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken  the receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong  today i ordered chicken mcnuggets as a combo  again and as i said before cold fries  and i can guarantee the mcnuggets werent fresh  i got my food before i even got my change  it had all been sitting there well before i ordered  besides the food service was terrible  there was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food  it made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour  rather than calling out an order or order number when ready she looked at my boss and said this is yours  how rude  there was a gentelman waiting for his food since before i walked in and was still waiting after i got mine  his wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh  she got a dirty look from the same rude cashier  i miss the days of the old manager whom i have not seen in a few months  he had the staff on their game,1

on my second visit with my family my daughters mac and cheese arrived in under five minutes but it was too salty and tasted bad if a sevenyearold who eats mac and cheese at least four times a week doesnt like it it must be poor quality we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and we were out of water the whole time our tempura zucchini appetizer was more like beerbattered and the zucchini was undercooked the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on top and liquid floating which is not good for a mayonnaisebased,0

you recognize that its a cheesecake factory and they tend to have consistent food service and layout across their branches typically i would give the chain a 4 for food quality and service but this specific location is harder to enter than others when its busy because of that i gave it a 3 its not their fault but weve wasted a lot of time waiting for a table or takeout cheesecake we likely wont plan on going to this location again unless its during offpeak hours,2

im a fan of og because they serve dim sum until late at night there are different carts for dim sum and ladies push them around with various options such as steamed fried starch sweets and buns they give you a card to keep track of your selections and each item on the cart has a different price based on the cart type when you choose a dish the lady puts a stamp on your card and the stamps are counted to determine your food cost its essential to be mindful when selecting items because they cost between 140 and over 260 each and the cost can add up quickly,2
