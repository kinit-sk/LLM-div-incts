first a few things you should know about brillobox conveniently situated at the corner of penn and main it was once called nooners and then zootys both were safe havens for morning drunks pitstops for killing time on the way to the methadone clinic and hangouts for sightings of the infamous lawrenceville sweatpants hookers who were shabbychic in the way that your creepy uncle lous basement gameroom isnnbut in late 2005 the 224 started blowing up in a big way and a new york couple bought the bar and converted it to our beloved brillo from that point on it was destined to evolve into the libations palace for grad students upmc pediatric surgery residents and 1890s moustache fetishists that you know and love todaynnalong the way brillobox went through an alltoobrief adolescence that was equal parts awkward and beautiful notable patrons from its 20062008 era included tap pantsclad american apparel employees en route to the greenpoint lofts theyd bought with daddys money 30somethings who preached the importance of tolerance and diversity as they strove hard to shut down brian  coopers mini mart because it brought black people into friendship and a motley crew of aspiring rimbauds kerouacs and burroughses that last group was alcoholic very very alcoholic and they smoked like chimneys and they danced like fiends and they gave that place character goddamitnnthen in the dawn of the 2010s brillo made its final push toward adulthood and as all emerging adults do it made a few bold gestures to demonstrate that it had finally arrived first an allvegetarian menu designed to delight the meatless denziens of penn avenue secondly a smoking ban to win the approval of yogaloving bike nuts and stay in compliance with new state laws and finally a remodel enabling the front windows to open in the summer so the sweet sounds of goldfrapp could be heard as far away as the davita dialysis clinicnnnow brillos okay it has a vast beer selection if you love beer the bartenders still mix the drinks strong and the service is decent if a little slow when the place is packed on weekends the downstairs room can get loud and crowded and if you arrive after 9 pm you probably wont be sitting but in its evolution from burnout wino bar to upscale microbrew pub it lost a bunch of character along the way that probably wont be coming back although the meat has made a triumphant return to the menu,2

i really want to like this place  i have several friends that told me about it  they have a good vibe and an interesting menu but unfortunately after 2 bad visits in 1 week i wont be returningnni went with the family last weekend and had a great waiter but the food was just so so  the drink wasnt good and the burger was well done instead of medium  they gave me a free drink and the manager came over on the burger  i told her it was just feedback on the burger and i didnt want to make a big deal about it even though it was burntnni went back last night with the family  my daughters mac and cheese came out in less than 5 minutes  it was salty and tasted bad  if a 7 year old who eats mac and cheese at least 4 times a week doesnt like it then it has to be badnnthen we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and the whole time we were out of water  our appetizer tempura zucchini  was more like beer battered and the zucchini was too thick and under cooked  the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on the top and liquid floating plus it was hot  not good for a mayonaise based productnnordered a chicken dinner to split  it was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside  it sat in a bowl of mush which tasted horribly  we didnt eat hardly any of it and told the waiter who didnt acknowledge the problem but did go show the manager which happened to be the same woman that we spoke with the last time we were in  instead of her coming over and talking to us they just took the meal offnni appreciate that they have not charged us for some of our items that were screwed up but there seems to be little concern for the customer  they need to fire the chef fire the expediter inspect their wait staff for consistency in quality of service and inspect what their customer experience is all about nnwe eat out every day and are always looking for good places  this place has potential but its being managed poorly,0

i have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile  the last two visits have been a disappointment  my french fries were cold both times  i ordered a premium chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken  the receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong  today i ordered chicken mcnuggets as a combo  again and as i said before cold fries  and i can guarantee the mcnuggets werent fresh  i got my food before i even got my change  it had all been sitting there well before i ordered  besides the food service was terrible  there was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food  it made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour  rather than calling out an order or order number when ready she looked at my boss and said this is yours  how rude  there was a gentelman waiting for his food since before i walked in and was still waiting after i got mine  his wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh  she got a dirty look from the same rude cashier  i miss the days of the old manager whom i have not seen in a few months  he had the staff on their game,1

on my second visit with my family my daughters mac and cheese arrived in under five minutes but it was too salty and tasted bad if a sevenyearold who eats mac and cheese at least four times a week doesnt like it it must be poor quality we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and we were out of water the whole time our tempura zucchini appetizer was more like beerbattered and the zucchini was undercooked the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on top and liquid floating which is not good for a mayonnaisebased product,0

stayed four nights here with my girlfriend for a business conference when we arrived the line to check in was not bad we arrived early and we were able to check in early for a fee 28 i believe we were told if we waited 12 hour the fee would only be 15 but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons they also provided a refrigerator in room free normally 25day for medical reasons which is that i had medication that needed to be refrigerated nnentering the room i noticed one bed was seriously concave but the other one was fine there was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed we informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didnt care enough to change rooms the carpet was loose looked like water damage to me the tv was fine but has absolutely no jacks so you cant hook anything up to watch movies or music or games they do charge for internet 1399day per device good news is starbucks and some restaurants have free wifi nnthe bathroom was huge and very nice but the shower was weak the bathtub is awesome and easily fits two but ours didnt drain so called maintenance they didnt fix it the first night gross but the second time we called they snaked it made mess housekeeping came to clean whole process took about three hours i assume the issue was resolved but we didnt use the tub again after that also when people in other rooms shower it is loud as hell but i never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lolnnwe called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues the girl that answered olivia has a thick accent apparently she was saying manager but to us it sounded like she was saying money gift and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding she was rude accused my gf of laughing at her and then hung up on her call back and got the gm brian he was a dick from the start he offered to give us a free late check out which we already had arranged so he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge a total discount of 36 nnwhile speaking with brian we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasnt ours so we called the room service manager pharrin she was absolutely awesome she immediately looked into the incorrect charge took it off our bill and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning nnoverall it was ok and mostly our individual room  the front desk people that got the 1 star i would stay there again all the fees are kinda ridiculous but there are ways around those,0
