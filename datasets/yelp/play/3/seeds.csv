so this is my update after a total debacle with the dental specialty group office not coming through with honoring what they quoted in pricing my dental implant  dr lillien did a great job in his work but then the office turned around and wanted to charge me another 750 for an abutment that was quoted as being included in the original pricennneedless to say if your dentist drives a maserati you are probably going to get screwed over so he can make his payment,0
i really want to like this place  i have several friends that told me about it  they have a good vibe and an interesting menu but unfortunately after 2 bad visits in 1 week i wont be returningnni went with the family last weekend and had a great waiter but the food was just so so  the drink wasnt good and the burger was well done instead of medium  they gave me a free drink and the manager came over on the burger  i told her it was just feedback on the burger and i didnt want to make a big deal about it even though it was burntnni went back last night with the family  my daughters mac and cheese came out in less than 5 minutes  it was salty and tasted bad  if a 7 year old who eats mac and cheese at least 4 times a week doesnt like it then it has to be badnnthen we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter and the whole time we were out of water  our appetizer tempura zucchini  was more like beer battered and the zucchini was too thick and under cooked  the southwest aioli looked like it had a crust on the top and liquid floating plus it was hot  not good for a mayonaise based productnnordered a chicken dinner to split  it was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside  it sat in a bowl of mush which tasted horribly  we didnt eat hardly any of it and told the waiter who didnt acknowledge the problem but did go show the manager which happened to be the same woman that we spoke with the last time we were in  instead of her coming over and talking to us they just took the meal offnni appreciate that they have not charged us for some of our items that were screwed up but there seems to be little concern for the customer  they need to fire the chef fire the expediter inspect their wait staff for consistency in quality of service and inspect what their customer experience is all about nnwe eat out every day and are always looking for good places  this place has potential but its being managed poorly,0
stayed four nights here with my girlfriend for a business conference when we arrived the line to check in was not bad we arrived early and we were able to check in early for a fee 28 i believe we were told if we waited 12 hour the fee would only be 15 but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons they also provided a refrigerator in room free normally 25day for medical reasons which is that i had medication that needed to be refrigerated nnentering the room i noticed one bed was seriously concave but the other one was fine there was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed we informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didnt care enough to change rooms the carpet was loose looked like water damage to me the tv was fine but has absolutely no jacks so you cant hook anything up to watch movies or music or games they do charge for internet 1399day per device good news is starbucks and some restaurants have free wifi nnthe bathroom was huge and very nice but the shower was weak the bathtub is awesome and easily fits two but ours didnt drain so called maintenance they didnt fix it the first night gross but the second time we called they snaked it made mess housekeeping came to clean whole process took about three hours i assume the issue was resolved but we didnt use the tub again after that also when people in other rooms shower it is loud as hell but i never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lolnnwe called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues the girl that answered olivia has a thick accent apparently she was saying manager but to us it sounded like she was saying money gift and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding she was rude accused my gf of laughing at her and then hung up on her call back and got the gm brian he was a dick from the start he offered to give us a free late check out which we already had arranged so he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge a total discount of 36 nnwhile speaking with brian we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasnt ours so we called the room service manager pharrin she was absolutely awesome she immediately looked into the incorrect charge took it off our bill and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning nnoverall it was ok and mostly our individual room  the front desk people that got the 1 star i would stay there again all the fees are kinda ridiculous but there are ways around those,0
we dine at dw bistro regularly but tonight we had a very bad experience the service tonight was exceptionally slow we had to wait 10 minutes before someone took our order and 30 minutes after our salad was served  we waited for an hour for our main entree to show up but it never did we had to follow up twice from our server please note that we did it very nicely on where was our food and he even blamed the kitchen for the slow service and that it wasnt his fault nnin the end my bf was so pissed that the server didnt even have the decency to tell us that the kitchen is running behind we just left and paid for the salad nnwe love the food at dw but if the service is like this too bad we are scratching you off our list,0

this was uhm interesting we had friends come down to visit us from michigan and we were looking for someplace decent to eat and planned on going to a strip club afterwards went to tix4tonight and came across treasures50 entrees free admission to stripclub and free limo we figure sure why not its everything in one plus a free limo the restaurant and strip club were in one building but the restaurant part took over half of the building and the stripclub was in the other halfthe food was alright but it was weird trying to eat and strippers kept walking by to get to the table behind us im assuming a bachelor party maybe i dont exactly enjoy eating with naked ladies in my presence haha but hey i guess some guys enjoy that no regrets though it was an interesting experience checked out the stripclub for a little bit after food but it wasnt that great at all we left pretty quick,1
i have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile  the last two visits have been a disappointment  my french fries were cold both times  i ordered a premium chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken  the receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong  today i ordered chicken mcnuggets as a combo  again and as i said before cold fries  and i can guarantee the mcnuggets werent fresh  i got my food before i even got my change  it had all been sitting there well before i ordered  besides the food service was terrible  there was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food  it made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour  rather than calling out an order or order number when ready she looked at my boss and said this is yours  how rude  there was a gentelman waiting for his food since before i walked in and was still waiting after i got mine  his wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh  she got a dirty look from the same rude cashier  i miss the days of the old manager whom i have not seen in a few months  he had the staff on their game,1
i love the bjs chain but this restaurant is very hit and miss  i have had some of the worst service in my life at this place  last winter a group of seven sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks and then another 20 minutes to order  so 50 minutes before we ordered our food  the pizza at this particular bjs is terrible they put almost no sauce on the bread and over cook it,1

its bad i understand lots of people need to send packages or apply for passports but it seems like no matter what time of day you go the wait in line sucks i have waited anywhere from 1050min just to send a mailer envelope they often only have one or two people behind the desk and they are pretty darn slow nnalso had an issue when i first moved to vegas i sent about 12 boxes through the postal service all the same size and weight yet they only delivered a handful of them directly to my apartment complex the rest arrived and i had to go to the post office to pick them up doesnt make any sense the ones that arrived to my complex did so over several days just a pain during an already stressful timennif you can avoid this locationdo,1
daura damm gf beer available and for a first visit this pleased me a lotnni dont find myself in leith that often and although weve had a few brunches in leith ive always found the menus to be lacking in gf friendliness so ive tended to avoidnnthe lioness is one of the new gang of pubs which have opened over the last year or so all reclaimed furniture lots of wood and even a pinball machine you can sit at we of course sat at the pinball machine for novelty value but not the most comfortable as i hate sitting on stoolsnnso gf beer available  yay we grabbed some quick snacks  chips which were ok and nothing outstanding hence the three stars if im in the area then i probably would pop back and try some more of the menu as there were gf friendly dishes listed and maybe will increase the star rating,2
small hole in the wall quick food for the drunken hordes that creep around mill at night or a quick bite during the day i like the falafels here better than at pita pit service was hospitable ill return,2
first a few things you should know about brillobox conveniently situated at the corner of penn and main it was once called nooners and then zootys both were safe havens for morning drunks pitstops for killing time on the way to the methadone clinic and hangouts for sightings of the infamous lawrenceville sweatpants hookers who were shabbychic in the way that your creepy uncle lous basement gameroom isnnbut in late 2005 the 224 started blowing up in a big way and a new york couple bought the bar and converted it to our beloved brillo from that point on it was destined to evolve into the libations palace for grad students upmc pediatric surgery residents and 1890s moustache fetishists that you know and love todaynnalong the way brillobox went through an alltoobrief adolescence that was equal parts awkward and beautiful notable patrons from its 20062008 era included tap pantsclad american apparel employees en route to the greenpoint lofts theyd bought with daddys money 30somethings who preached the importance of tolerance and diversity as they strove hard to shut down brian  coopers mini mart because it brought black people into friendship and a motley crew of aspiring rimbauds kerouacs and burroughses that last group was alcoholic very very alcoholic and they smoked like chimneys and they danced like fiends and they gave that place character goddamitnnthen in the dawn of the 2010s brillo made its final push toward adulthood and as all emerging adults do it made a few bold gestures to demonstrate that it had finally arrived first an allvegetarian menu designed to delight the meatless denziens of penn avenue secondly a smoking ban to win the approval of yogaloving bike nuts and stay in compliance with new state laws and finally a remodel enabling the front windows to open in the summer so the sweet sounds of goldfrapp could be heard as far away as the davita dialysis clinicnnnow brillos okay it has a vast beer selection if you love beer the bartenders still mix the drinks strong and the service is decent if a little slow when the place is packed on weekends the downstairs room can get loud and crowded and if you arrive after 9 pm you probably wont be sitting but in its evolution from burnout wino bar to upscale microbrew pub it lost a bunch of character along the way that probably wont be coming back although the meat has made a triumphant return to the menu,2
i like og because they serve dim sum until 1030pnndim sum is served in carts there are ladies pushing around carts of different types of dimsum there is a steamed cart fried cart starch cart sweets and buns nnyou get a card and the things on each cart have a different price depending on the cart when you get an item the lady will put a stamp on your card they add up the stamps and that is your food costnnbe careful grabbing too much the items have between 14 and cost over 26 each so that quickly adds up they also have a normal menunnive been eating dim sum since i was a good and all of their dishes are goodnnnothing is necessarily great but definitely goodnni would say definitely try to go during peak hours because the food is more freshnnmost of the items are different forms of dumplings nnthey also have fried shrimp chinese broccoli and other things aside from the dumingsnntry the fried stuff try the stuff with chili sauce try the stuff with their mayonnthe cashier girl is super rude she never says hi thank you or smilesnni prefer this place over cathay house because their servers dont skip tables,2
it wasnt aok but i am not a huge fan either macaroni grill deserves a little more than an aokay its for sure better than olive garden and great for a fast italian chain the food was actually decent and reasonably priced  i will come back again,2
you know its a cheesecake factory  theyre all the same as far as food service and layout  normally i give the chain a 4 based on food quality and good service but this location is far more challenging to get into than others during busy times  i gave it a three based on that  not their fault i guess but weve wasted a lot of time waiting around for a table or even for togo cheesecake  we probably wont plan on going to this location again unless its during the off hours,2
i really like this casino  i was informed it is the only one in vegas that has a completely  separate  nonsmoking room i tell you  the air is cleaner in there i think it is filtered nthe hotel is clean and inexpensive plus you can walk to an awesome antique store that lasts forever,3
i thought chateau was great i wouldnt normally go to one of the large vegas clubs but we were invited by a friend and on the guest list so i decided to check it out i had a really good time the club is nice i do have to say it was on the crowded side and bathroom lines were long even the guys line nni enjoyed the outdoor area that had great views of the strip drinks are on the pricey side there was a performance by ciara that was a nice surprise for me nni would recommend checking this place out nni also wrote more about vegas restaurants hotels and showsand more importantly how to save money while theremore info at httpletsjetsetcom,3

i love hot dogs love so why did it take me so long to visit buldogis location its almost a 30 minute drive for me which is far for vegas and the hot dog isnt exactly a meal i plan out way in advance nthat being said the hot dogs are awesome great selection of specialty dogs with american korean and mexican toppings or you can always go plain jane the dog itself is really high quality  all beef with plenty of snap and if that doesnt appeal to you they have a spicy one a veggie one and i think one thats more like sausage we tried the bulgogi and east coast pastrami and sauerkraut dogs and both were great about 6 each and very filling the munchkin likes her corn dog but it wasnt anything special we went for plain fries instead if one with all the toppings which was good because the dogs were way filling nthe ambiance is a little lacking as almost nothing was changed from the old quiznos  they even use the same q open signnoverall i loved it but its a little far to be a random lunch spot for us,3
note for sushi bar did not go for hibachi because ive had enough of benihana and it seemed really pricey wait was also nonexistent for sushi at the bar nnanother disclaimer im used to california sushi restaurants  chains japanese friends would have much higher standards and i havent had good sushi since ive moved out to dcnnfriend  i shared pittsburgh penguins roll when in pittsburgh spicy squid salad salmon ceviche cannot find on online menu and philadelphia roll because somehow my friend has never had itnneverything was really good i especially liked the spicy squid salad and the salmon ceviche the latter had pretty thick pieces of salmon but was so nicely presented that i didnt really mind at all the same cannot be said for everyone nnoverall good solid japanese restaurant would go again,3
