this place is awful one roll cost almost 17 and was the same quality sushi you would get at vons you can get better sushi at a convenience store avoid this place,0
the worst experience ever my first time going was not fun it literally took 16 minutes for one chicken taco and chips when i finally got the taco it had a piece of metal in it the chicken was cold and looked weird i will never go there because its not clean and the food suck,0
horrible customer service  came here for an alignment and because they though it would take more than an hour they wanted me to return tomorrow i understand that it might take them 1020 mins after their operating hours but come on go the extra mile a bit for your customer horrible customer service,0
i was highly disappointed with this place i have never been treated so badly in las vegas in my life especially with me being a girl nnfirst of all we werent even planning to go to their club but their promoter kept pushing it so we agreed to give it a shot ive only been to the bank at the bellagio and that place sucks so i was willing to give this a shot when we got into the hotel we were stopped by another promoter which i guess was the promoter for the bank and he kept pushing it and we kindly declined and asked where hyde was located at that point he was extremely rude so that didnt help and i shot back with some wise comments which are too inappropriate to repeat on here and stormed off nnsince it was me my other female friend and our guy friend we just walked up to the front and showed the bouncer our passes he smiled and told us we would get in right away however right when he saw our guy friend he asked if he was with us and we said yes and instantly his demeanor changed and told us to get in line i was absolutely disgusted i have never had that happen before and i have never had to wait in line to get into a club in vegas before pissed off my female friend and i went to a different bouncer who wished me a happy birthday it was my birthday weekend stamped our hand and let us in eventually i would never recommend this place to anyone and the club wasnt even that great anyways,0
i ordered a desk and small cabinet online and was told i could pick it up in two days  when i went to the pickup desk it took them 15 minutes to locate my items  the box for the smaller cabinet looked like it had been through the shredder  the desk box looked finennwhen i got home to assemble both pieces i discovered that both were damaged  i took the afternoon off from work to pickup and assemble my furniture  i also dropped my old desk off at goodwill on the way to get my new desk  since i had to return the damaged desk i am now running my home based business from a banquet table  thanks living spacesnni completed an online survey emailed to me by living spaces letting them know my concerns  i also completed the section requesting a customer service rep to give me a call  two weeks later and still no call  i completed the survey again today  standby for more updates stay away from these guyspoor customer service,0
i always will give a business a second chance my second visit was worst than my first i have had both a manicure and pedicure given to me by two of the rudest people save your time and money and go elsewhere to enjoy your spa experience because you probably wont enjoy it here,0
after seeing the line for steak n shake we made a quick uturn and listened to our tummies who told us to sit and eat anythingnownmy parents love the chinese food here and we were feeling a little sick so we decided to try a bowl of wonton soup egg rolls and a side saladnwonton soup  i liked itit wasnt the best or the worst the broth  nthank goodness had taste and the wontons were big for the price though i thought the bowl shouldve been bigger i was surprised because most everything here is cheap but not the chinese foodnegg rolls  i hate when places just cut the eggroll in two and then consider it 2 pieces when its actually 1 damn piece goshnanyways they do this here the taste was just like the soupnot the best or the worstnside salad  typicalnthey give you fried chow mein noodles with various dipping sauces for freenwarning these fried chow mein noodles may chip your toothhopfully i just got a fried to long yucky order of itnwould i come back   not if i was paying thats for sure,1
okay store  still have a lot of empty shelves in the store great way to compare with other asian supermarkets  i think ill pass and go somewhere else,1
steiners lets have a talk you serve food and allow people to smoke cigarettes but cigars are over the line to non smokers there isnt a difference they both stink cigarettes cling to everything your hair clothes hands and especially the room i can smoke a cigar inside and a hour later you cant smell it so please a reply would or a post on your yelp would be appreciated,1
i only gave this place two stars because i just left its been about 20 minutes ago and i havent puked yet the pho is terrible especially for the price,1
we were here for lunch during a weekday  the food isnt bad but the service makes the whole experience 2 stars  we waited for almost half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies and the place was emptynif you dont mind repeating your order 3 times and having them mess upforget your order you could give this place a try  since we usually dont have more than an hour for lunch break during a work day we will not be coming back never,1
i bought a groupon for here when a few gfs and i were going to meet for lunch im glad i had it because i dont find it worth paying full price for what they offer or for their customer service nni got a caesar wrap a sunrise smoothie and a kids pizza meal with an extra kid smoothie the girl behind the counter couldnt answer any of my questions when it came to the smoothies i asked a simple question too like whats the different in supercharged ones vs indulgent she just said i dont know okay thanks super helpful then they forgot the extra kids smoothie and when i asked about it she said hold on yet no one ever brought it out and after my meal asked to be refunded nnill only go back to use my last two vouchers and will probably only get smoothies and avoid the food i did notice they had a good happy hour deal on smoothies so if i did visit again without a groupon would probably be during that special,1
seeing the affiliation with bobby flay immediately sparked my interest but bobbys burger palace just barely lived up to its namesake although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh the burger was not anything extraordinary nnmy boyfriend had the vegas burger which was definitely more unique with red chilies and bbq chips that gave an extra crunch i ordered the la burger with chicken breast which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings the chicken was cooked really well but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom so i was holding onto mush by the end of my burger overall the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special we also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries which came with great dipping sauces chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce they also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeu00f1o sauce nnif youre looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the strip bobbys burger palace can tide you over for a little bit but i would recommend checking out other more noteworthy spots when youre in a city filled with amazing food,2
the burger was excellent the fries were meh the shake was meh but the place is known for burgers so i would go back for that alone,2
very beutiful casino filled with ornate decorations and statues they won more from me than i did from them but other than that my gambling experience here was mediocre,2
ordered a few different dips and appetizers  the crab dip with pita chips were amazing but the guacamole was less than impressive  it tasted like processed guacnothing fresh about it  ive had the fish tacos with a fruity drink in the past and they were delicious  great atmosphere and food overall,2
this review is based on a few things the casino itself the movie theaters a few stores and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since i was a small childnnsams town has been around for a long time and even has an album named after it if you dont know the artist just look it up its a good ol western themed place plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo on that level the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars but i think its gone down hill in the past couple yearsnnhere are some good things the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept theyre hardly ever really busy which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourselfnnsams town also has sheplers which is a great place to find western wear in las vegasnni am weary of the restaurants here as i experienced an upset tummy after eating at the tgi fridays the mexican place here is called willy  joses and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now  but i have yet to indulgennits not the best place nor is it the worst it is a locals hotel and out of all the places on boulder highway i like this casino the best,2
so disappointed with this hotel  i prepaid a trip there for one night with my friend for her 50th bd and she came down with strep throat that morning so had to cancel on me  i called the hotel explaining and asking if we could transfer to another date spend our money there at the spa and restaurants just on another date and was met with a resounding nonnso i went alone to not lose the investment  nni was met with a valet parking attendant putting a high pressure on me to valet park my vehicle before id even checked in  i had to practically argue with her to explain why i wanted to check in first before turning my car over to valet  good thing i did because the parking is included in the exorbitant resort fee self parking and its directly adjacent to the valet  meaning it would have been the same long walk to my room from either locale  when i finally said id like to check in before deciding i was chastised with this well it better not take you more than 5 minutes because you cant leave your car here longer than that  i was floored  i was in a spacious entry area with exactly one other car  this was my bad first impressionnni walked quite a distance to find my room which was very far from the main areas of the hotel  it was on the end in a kind of dark creepy low area which i did not feel comfortable with before setting in i called the front desk asking if they perhaps had a second floor unit as a solo female traveler would feel more comfortable  i was met with no we are fully commited tonite and shot down  nni then left my room to explore and was met with a big spacious ghost town  certainly not a feel of a place fully commited  i saw rows and rows of rooms clearly unoccupied and it was 5pm  i knew id been lied to  perhaps it was because i had prepurchased my stay at a  discount  i would have preferred the honestly on that  that you get lesser desired rooms by going that route  nnthe rooms are gorgeous  the tv is great and i was so delighted to see they actually have a dvr which will record your shows  so i set it to record 2 shows ventured out to the restaurant where i was literally one of 3 people sitting at the bar to eat the restaurant itself looked about 14 filledat 8pm on a sun night  the food was good but way expensive i paid over 50 for 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine  nngot back to my room  clicked on my recorded shows to find  technical error so they hadnt recorded after all  bummernnso in the morning imagine my surprise when the coffee machine in the room requires you to pay 3 for the actual coffee to put in it  ive stayed in many 35 star hotels and have never run in to something that audacious  put the coffee maker there then make you pay for itnni decided then and there this place would not get any more of my money and checked out at 9am  i will not return nor recommend this resort to anyone else and im a local who goes out frequently enjoys staycations and refers guests to local hotels this one is off the list,2
i really wanted to give this place 35 stars since its pretty expensive and i was only impressed by 1 dish of many that we ordered if you like avocado order the avocado train rollits pretty awesome and has a ton of avocado and a side of crabavocado thats pretty tasty,3
a delicious affordable place to go for breakfastand my favorite part your pooch can enjoy the patio with you  breakfast was very straightforward but thats not necessarily a bad thing  i chose a short stack of whole wheat pancakes and a side of hashbrowns while my date chose the cinnamon challah french toast  my order was perfection simply because of the portion sizethe pancakes were much smaller than those in the full order and came with three  i was actually able to eat them all instead of wasting a lot as i normally do with a small appetiteand for 350 it was fantastic  the hashbrowns were also crisp and well seasoned  as for the french toast other reviewers have described it and i agree with them  a little dry but nothing a dousing of syrup cant cure  the crunchy almonds and fresh berries on top are a great touchnnmy iced vanilla latte was delicious and my pup enjoyed the misters on the patio  definitely recommended,3
great locals casino for more low key gaming without all of the bright flashing lights and loud obnoxious noises usually associated with a casino has a subway and an ice cream parlor at the entrance so this place is as normal as it gets and not at all fancy ncame recently for an event wwes summer slam ppv was screened on a series of three large projection screens in the tournament room for a 5 cover complete with various concessions offered such as hit dogs nachos and 2 beers much like youd find at the event itself though i dont think that was intentionalnnfood was okay and prices were reasonable view was good and seating was both plentiful and wellplaced even for those of us who only arrived with a half hour to spare before show time soeons mentioned that reserved seats had been available but from our seats a 13 of the way back we could see and hear everything well so i dont know that id bother,3
i was excited to finally try lil brown sugar cupcakes after reading the reviews my only disappointment was i did not go sooner that day nnwe arrived in the afternoon and the display case was pretty scarce a lady greeted us owner and explained that she had much of her supply sell out that morning of course my first thought is it must be good she still had some red velvets strawberry lemonades and one lonely triple chocolate cupcake left we request one of each except the red velvet other items there were chocolate chip cookies gooey bars and brownies nnhow did the cupcakes taste amazing i cant remember the last cupcake that was as moist and tasteful im one of those cupcake eaters who only like a tiny bit of frosting however this frosting was great not overly sweet and overpowering she told us the strawberry lemonade was her most popular and now i can see why what was i thinking just getting one nnill definitely be back to try her other flavors including the red velvet even maybe for her gooey bar which she let us samplenni highly recommend giving lil brown sugar a visit next time you want an amazing cupcake,3
awesome stuffed meat pie needed more sauce but im just saucy like that ill be back next time for a regular pie tip sit closer to the ovens warmer part of the dining area,3
great staff jennifer is a great bartender fantastic,3
after being enticed into a contract with a scam company who took my money and failed to deliver i found my credit was erroneously marred this company had been barred from half of the us by state attorney generals for disreputable business dealings however i couldnt get their bogus collection claims off my credit report scott coached me from start to finish and eventually guided me to seek legal support the attorney provided the extra push to get a letter of deletion which has cleared my credit report of all derogatory information scott gave me the guidance and support to keep going and prevail against the credit demons,4
great food and atmosphere love the decor the steamed bbq pork buns i got bbq platter with duck pork and chicken,4
guy savoy set the standard for fine dining  our dinner last night was remarkable  nnthe food was exquisite  i had the lobster fois gras and the artichoke truffe soup the presentation was beautiful  the food was defiantly the star nnthe host was wonderful and the service was impecable she insured our experience was remarkable  she was very patient and treated us very welnnan evening at guy savoy is an experience to be savored  i am afraid to come back only because the experience was so perfect,4
its a small place family owned and operated  clean and great service,4
we had a tankless system installed a few years ago by a different company that did an improper install and could have caused serious damage to our home  we called  the water heater man and they worked with noritz were able to get us a warranty replacement and then they properly installed and inspected the new unit and ventilation  a few weeks ago we called them for a minor plumbing leak and they had it fixed quickly and the charges were reasonable  nice to have a company that we can trust  thank you,4
we come here to enjoy the movies that we really want to see they place is so clean i like the crowds here because if you are watching a funny movie you can hear the whole place covered in laughter and i like laughing along with other people that enjoy a certain movienot much annoying texters or phone callers so thats a plusalot of people are courteous when they have crying babies and they go outside which is cool because the rest of us want to enjoy the  movie the food is a little pricy but then again arent all movie theaters like that,4
