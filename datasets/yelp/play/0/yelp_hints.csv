my initial experience at this establishment was nothing short of dreadful it took an agonizing 16 minutes to receive a single chicken taco and some chips to make matters worse the taco contained a piece of metal the chicken was cold and appeared unusual consequently i will never set foot in that place again due to its unhygienic conditions and substandard food,0
my first time at this place was the worst experience ever i waited for 16 minutes just to get a chicken taco and some chips and when i finally got it there was a piece of metal inside the chicken was cold and looked weird because of this i will never go back there again because its not clean and the food is awful,0
the burger was excellent though the fries and milkshake were underwhelming regardless as the place is renowned for its burgers i would go back just to have another one,2
we made a uturn and opted for chinese food after seeing the long line at steak n shake our parents love the chinese food here and since we felt a bit unwell we decided to try wonton soup egg rolls and a side salad the soup was decent with a tasty broth and large wontons but the bowl could have been bigger considering the price we were surprised because most other food items are cheap here except for the chinese food,1
the burger was exceptional while the fries and shake were mediocre yet because the establishment is famous for its burgers i would return solely for that reason,2
seeing bobby flays connection to the restaurant initially caught my attention but bobbys burger palace didnt quite meet expectations despite the reasonable prices and fresh ingredients the burgers were satisfying but not extraordinary and the vegas burger was more distinctive with its red chilies and bbq chips my chicken la burger topped with guacamole had wellcooked chicken but the cheese was rem,2

its a compact familymanaged location with cleanliness and outstanding customer service,4
our primary reason for coming to this establishment is to savor the movies we truly wish to see and the cleanliness of the location is impressive the crowds here are enjoyable particularly when watching a humorous movie as the entire place is filled with laughter and its pleasurable to laugh together with others who share an interest in the same movie there are relatively few annoying texters or callers which is a plus additionally many people are courteous by taking their crying babies outside allowing the rest of the audience to enjoy the film uninterrupted although the food is somewhat expensive its comparable to other movie theaters,4
i was incredibly let down by this establishment i have never been treated so poorly in las vegas especially as a girl we initially didnt plan to visit their club but a promoter persuaded us so we agreed to give it a try i had only been to the bank at the bellagio which i didnt like so i was open to trying something new when we arrived at the hotel another promoter approached us pushing the bank and when we declined he was very rude i responded with some inappropriate comments and left since it was me my other female friend and our guy friend we went to the front and showed the bouncer our passes he welcomed us and said wed get in immediately but when he saw our guy friend his attitude changed and he told us to get in line i was appalled ive never experienced that before and have never waited in line for a club in vegas angry my female friend and i went to another bouncer who wished me a happy birthday it was my birthday weekend and let us in eventually i would not recommend this place to anyone and the club wasnt even that great,0
we come here to enjoy the movies that we really want to see they place is so clean i like the crowds here because if you are watching a funny movie you can hear the whole place covered in laughter and i like laughing along with other people that enjoy a certain movienot much annoying texters or phone callers so thats a plusalot of people are courteous when they have crying babies and they go outside which is cool because the rest of us want to enjoy the  movie the food is a little pricy but then again arent all movie theaters like that,4
the establishment is a small familymanaged business that offers cleanliness and excellent customer service,4
i was highly disappointed with this place i have never been treated so badly in las vegas in my life especially with me being a girl,0
after being tricked by a fraudulent company that took my money and failed to deliver my credit was erroneously tarnished this company had been barred from half of the us by state attorney generals for disreputable business practices but i couldnt get their bogus collection claims off my credit report scott coached and supported me throughout the entire process eventually guiding me to seek legal assistance the attorney provided the necessary momentum to obtain a letter of deletion which cleared my credit report of all negative information scotts guidance and encouragement empowered me to persist and triumph over the credit demons,4

hey steiners lets discuss this you offer food and permit smoking cigarettes but nonsmokers believe that cigars are excessive nevertheless there is no distinction between them – both emit a smell cigarette smoke,1
our previous tankless system was improperly installed by a different company posing a risk of serious harm to our home we reached out to the water heater man who worked with noritz to get us a warranty replacement they correctly set up and inspected the new unit and ventilation we had a minor plumbing leak recently and they quickly resolved it at a fair price its refreshing to have a trustworthy company so thank you,4
after seeing the line for steak n shake we made a quick turn and listened to our tummies who told us to sit and eat anything my parents love the chinese food here and since we were feeling a little sick we decided to try a bowl of wonton soup egg rolls and a side salad,1

seeing the affiliation with bobby flay immediately sparked my interest but bobbys burger palace just barely lived up to its namesake although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh the burger was not anything extraordinary nnmy boyfriend had the vegas burger which was definitely more unique with red chilies and bbq chips that gave an extra crunch i ordered the la burger with chicken breast which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings the chicken was cooked really well but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom so i was holding onto mush by the end of my burger overall the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special we also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries which came with great dipping sauces chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce they also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeu00f1o sauce nnif youre looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the strip bobbys burger palace can tide you over for a little bit but i would recommend checking out other more noteworthy spots when youre in a city filled with amazing food,2
a gorgeously designed casino with intricate embellishments and sculptures although they took more money from me than i did from them my gambling experience here was just average,2
an inexpensive breakfast place where your dog can join you on the patio  my favorite part breakfast was simple but thats not a bad thing i had a small stack of whole wheat pancakes and hashbrowns while my date had cinnamon challah french toast the portion size was perfect for me  i was able to finish all three pancakes instead of wasting food the hashbrowns were crispy and seasoned well the french toast was a bit dry but syrup fixed that the iced vanilla latte was delicious and the misters on the patio kept my pup cool definitely recommended,3
steiners lets have a talk you serve food and allow people to smoke cigarettes but cigars are over the line to non smokers there isnt a difference they both stink cigarettes cling to everything your hair clothes hands and especially the room i can smoke a cigar inside and a hour later you cant smell it so please a reply would or a post on your yelp would be appreciated,1
its a tiny familyowned and operated location with clean surroundings and outstanding service,4
a local casino offers a more laidback gaming experience without the usual flashing lights and loud noises the entrance features a subway and an ice cream parlor making it feel quite normal and not fancy recently a wwe summer slam ppv event was screened in the tournament room with a 5 cover charge including concessions like hot dogs nachos and two beers the food was decent prices were reasonable and seating was plentiful and wellplaced some attendees mentioned reserved seats but good visibility and hearing were experienced even from seats 13 rows back,3
i purchased a groupon for a restaurant where my friends and i planned to have lunch im glad i had the coupon because i dont think their food and service are worth paying full price for i got a caesar wrap a sunrise smoothie and a kids pizza meal with an extra kid smoothie the girl behind the counter couldnt answer my questions about the smoothies even when i asked a simple question like the difference between supercharged and indulgent ones she just said she didnt know which wasnt very helpful they also forgot the extra kids smoothie and when i asked about it the staff member said theyd bring it but never did after my meal i asked for a refund but no one brought it out ill only go back to use my last two vouchers and will probably just get smoothies and avoid the food i noticed they have a good happy hour deal on smoothies so if i visit again without a groupon id probably go during that special,1

we visit this place to relish the films were eager to watch as the venue is immaculately clean i appreciate the crowds here especially during comedic flicks as the entire theater resonates with laughter and its fun to giggle alongside fellow movie lovers there are minimal disturbances from texters or callers which is a positive aspect moreover many individuals exhibit consideration by stepping out with their crying infants allowing the rest of us to fully enjoy the film while the food is a bit pricey – thats typical of most movie theaters,4

this review is based on a few things the casino itself the movie theaters a few stores and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since i was a small childnnsams town has been around for a long time and even has an album named after it if you dont know the artist just look it up its a good ol western themed place plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo on that level the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars but i think its gone down hill in the past couple yearsnnhere are some good things the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept theyre hardly ever really busy which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourselfnnsams town also has sheplers which is a great place to find western wear in las vegasnni am weary of the restaurants here as i experienced an upset tummy after eating at the tgi fridays the mexican place here is called willy  joses and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now  but i have yet to indulgennits not the best place nor is it the worst it is a locals hotel and out of all the places on boulder highway i like this casino the best,2
in summary the reviewer believes that sams town is neither the best nor the worst place and it caters to locals among the casinos on boulder highway the reviewer prefers sams town the most,2
great locals casino for more low key gaming without all of the bright flashing lights and loud obnoxious noises usually associated with a casino has a subway and an ice cream parlor at the entrance so this place is as normal as it gets and not at all fancy ncame recently for an event wwes summer slam ppv was screened on a series of three large projection screens in the tournament room for a 5 cover complete with various concessions offered such as hit dogs nachos and 2 beers much like youd find at the event itself though i dont think that was intentionalnnfood was okay and prices were reasonable view was good and seating was both plentiful and wellplaced even for those of us who only arrived with a half hour to spare before show time soeons mentioned that reserved seats had been available but from our seats a 13 of the way back we could see and hear everything well so i dont know that id bother,3
the food at this restaurant wasnt awful but the service was so inadequate that it earned a 2star rating we visited during a weekday lunch and had to wait almost half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies in a nearempty establishment if you dont mind having to repeat your order and having it messed up you could try this place however due to limited lunch time during workdays we wont be returning,1
i gave this place a twostar rating because i left there around 20 minutes ago and i havent thrown up yet but the pho is really bad especially considering its price,1
we frequent this spot to delight in the mov,4
a local casino provides a relaxed atmosphere for gaming devoid of the typical bright lights and noisy environment at the entrance there is a subway and an ice cream parlor giving it a normal and nonfancy ambiance the wwe summer slam ppv was recently screened in the tournament room with a 5 admission which included various concessions like hot dogs nachos and two beers the food was satisfactory prices were reasonable and seating was abundant and wellpositioned even for those who arrived just 30 minutes before the show some attendees mentioned that reserved seating was available but from seats 13 rows back there was good,3
the burger was excellent the fries were meh the shake was meh but the place is known for burgers so i would go back for that alone,2
the local casino offers a more lowkey gaming experience without the flashing lights and loud noises it has a subway and an ice cream parlor at the entrance making it feel normal and not fancy,3
this is a modestsized familyrun business known for its clean environment and great service,4
jennifer an exceptional bartender leads a fantastic staff,3
4 despite my propensity to give businesses a second chance my second visit was more displeasing than the first i had both a manicure and pedicure performed by two highly discourteous individuals which has influenced me to advise others to save their time and money by seeking a more enjoyable spa experience elsewhere,0
last nights dinner at guy savoy was a memorable experience as the restaurant has set the standard for fine dining the food was exquisite including my lobster fois gras and artichoke truffe soup the presentation of the dishes was beautiful and the food was definitely the star of the show,4
this place is awful one roll cost almost 17 and was the same quality sushi you would get at vons you can get better sushi at a convenience store avoid this place,0
after being lured into a contract with a scam company that took my money and didnt deliver resulting in my credit being wrongfully damaged this company had been prohibited from operating in half of the us by state attorney generals due to their dishonest business dealings i was unable to remove their false collection claims from my credit report scott helped me every step of the way and eventually advised me to seek legal support the attorney provided the extra push needed to obtain a letter of deletion which cleared my credit report of all derogatory information scotts guidance and support gave me the strength to keep going and overcome the credit demons,4
i had a terrible experience at this hotel where i prepaid for a onenight stay for my friends 50th birthday unfortunately she got sick and couldnt go when i called the hotel to ask if we could change the date they refused the staff was unhelpful and the hotel was mostly empty despite being told it was fully committed the room was far from the main areas and i felt uncomfortable as a solo female traveler the food was good but expensive and the coffee machine required additional payment for the coffee i wont be returning or recommending this hotel,2
after falling victim to a fraudulent company that swindled my money and failed to provide their services i discovered that my credit had been erroneously tarnished this company had been banned by half of the us states due to their unscrupulous business practices however i was unable to remove their fraudulent collection claims from my credit report scott coached and supported me throughout the entire process eventually guiding me to seek legal assistance the attorney provided the necessary momentum to obtain a letter of deletion which cleared my credit report of all negative information scotts guidance and encouragement empowered me to persist and triumph over the credit demons,4
i ordered a desk and small cabinet online and was told i could pick it up in two days  when i went to the pickup desk it took them 15 minutes to locate my items  the box for the smaller cabinet looked like it had been through the shredder  the desk box looked finennwhen i got home to assemble both pieces i discovered that both were damaged  i took the afternoon off from work to pickup and assemble my furniture  i also dropped my old desk off at goodwill on the way to get my new desk  since i had to return the damaged desk i am now running my home based business from a banquet table  thanks living spacesnni completed an online survey emailed to me by living spaces letting them know my concerns  i also completed the section requesting a customer service rep to give me a call  two weeks later and still no call  i completed the survey again today  standby for more updates stay away from these guyspoor customer service,0
seeing the affiliation with bobby flay immediately sparked my interest but bobbys burger palace just barely lived up to its namesake although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh the burger was not anything extraordinary my boyfriend had the vegas burger which was definitely more unique with red chilies and bbq chips that gave an extra crunch i ordered the la burger with chicken breast which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings the chicken was cooked really well but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom so i was holding onto mush by the end of my burger overall the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special we also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries which came with great dipping sauces like chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce they also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeño sauce if youre looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the strip bobbys burger palace can tide you over for a little bit but i would recommend checking out other more noteworthy,2
although its quite costly i felt the need to give this establishment a 35star rating because i was only impressed with one dish out of the many we ordered the avocado train roll is a musttry as its packed with avocado and served with a delightful crabavocado side,3
despite the exquisite beauty of the casino replete with ornate decorations and statues my gambling experience here was only moderate as i lost more money to them than i won,2
terrible customer experience arrived for an alignment and was told to return the following day due to the service taking over an hour although i comprehend it could take 1020 minutes past their closing time they should have made more of an effort for their customers dreadful customer service,0
the okay store currently has numerous empty shelves which serves as a useful point of comparison with other asian supermarkets i think ill pass and go to a different store,1
this place is really bad the sushi which costs almost 17 is no better in quality than the ones youd get at vons you can actually find better sushi at a convenience store so its best to avoid this place,0
we made a uturn and opted for chinese food after seeing the long line at steak n shake our parents love the chinese food here and since we felt a bit unwell we decided to try wonton soup egg rolls and a side salad the soup was decent with a tasty broth and large wontons but the bowl could have been bigger considering the price we were surprised because most other food items are cheap here except for the chinese food the egg rolls were cut in half making it seem like there were two pieces when there was actually just one the taste was similar to the soup  neither the best nor the worst the side salad was typical and they provide complimentary fried chow mein noodles with various dipping sauces be careful though as these fried noodles might chip your tooth overall i wouldnt come back if i had to pay for it,1
during a weekday lunch visit the food wasnt terrible but the service was disappointing leading to a 2star rating we waited nearly half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies in an empty establishment if youre willing to repeat your order three times and deal with mixups you might consider trying this place due to limited time for lunch during workdays we wont be returning,1
great staff jennifer is a great bartender fantastic,3
though i typically believe in giving businesses a second chance my second visit was disappointingly worse than the first i received a manicure and pedicure from two extremely rude individuals leading me to suggest saving your time and money by visiting a different spa for a more enjoyable experience,0
awful customer service i came here for an alignment and they wanted me to come back the next day since it would take over an hour while i understand it might take 1020 minutes past their operating hours it would be nice if they went the extra mile for their customers horrible customer service,0
after observing the long queue at steak n shake we made a swift uturn and opted for chinese food as our stomachs told us to sit and eat my parents enjoy the chinese food here and since we felt a bit queasy we opted for wonton soup egg rolls and a side salad the soup was acceptable with a flavorful broth,1
i only gave two stars to this establishment because it has been 20 minutes since i left and i havent vomited yet the pho is terrible especially considering the price,1
i purchased several different dips and appetizers and the crab dip with pita chips were outstanding but the guacamole fell short it tasted artificial and not at all fresh ive enjoyed the fish tacos with a fruity beverage in the past and the ambiance and cuisine are generally excellent,2
okay store  still have a lot of empty shelves in the store great way to compare with other asian supermarkets  i think ill pass and go somewhere else,1
the host ensured our evening was truly remarkable as she was very attentive and ensured we were treated well the service was impeccable and the host was incredibly patient an evening at guy savoy is something to be cherished as it provides an unforgettable experience however im hesitant to return as the experience was so perfect that im afraid it wont be matched again,4
this is a compact familyrun enterprise known for its tidy environment and great service,4
i appreciate the great food atmosphere and the decor the steamed bbq pork buns were delicious and the bbq platter with duck pork and chicken was fantastic,4

i purchased a desk and small cabinet online and was informed that i could pick them up in two days when i went to collect my items it took the staff 15 minutes to locate them the box for the smaller cabinet was severely damaged while the desk box appeared fine however upon assembling both pieces at home i discovered that they were both damaged,0
i will definitely be back to try her other flavors including the red velvet and maybe even her gooey bar which she let us sample i highly recommend giving lil,3
the burger was outstanding but the fries and shake were just average however since the restaurant is renowned for its burgers i would definitely revisit for one,2
so disappointed with this hotel  i prepaid a trip there for one night with my friend for her 50th bd and she came down with strep throat that morning so had to cancel on me  i called the hotel explaining and asking if we could transfer to another date spend our money there at the spa and restaurants just on another date and was met with a resounding nonnso i went alone to not lose the investment  nni was met with a valet parking attendant putting a high pressure on me to valet park my vehicle before id even checked in  i had to practically argue with her to explain why i wanted to check in first before turning my car over to valet  good thing i did because the parking is included in the exorbitant resort fee self parking and its directly adjacent to the valet  meaning it would have been the same long walk to my room from either locale  when i finally said id like to check in before deciding i was chastised with this well it better not take you more than 5 minutes because you cant leave your car here longer than that  i was floored  i was in a spacious entry area with exactly one other car  this was my bad first impressionnni walked quite a distance to find my room which was very far from the main areas of the hotel  it was on the end in a kind of dark creepy low area which i did not feel comfortable with before setting in i called the front desk asking if they perhaps had a second floor unit as a solo female traveler would feel more comfortable  i was met with no we are fully commited tonite and shot down  nni then left my room to explore and was met with a big spacious ghost town  certainly not a feel of a place fully commited  i saw rows and rows of rooms clearly unoccupied and it was 5pm  i knew id been lied to  perhaps it was because i had prepurchased my stay at a  discount  i would have preferred the honestly on that  that you get lesser desired rooms by going that route  nnthe rooms are gorgeous  the tv is great and i was so delighted to see they actually have a dvr which will record your shows  so i set it to record 2 shows ventured out to the restaurant where i was literally one of 3 people sitting at the bar to eat the restaurant itself looked about 14 filledat 8pm on a sun night  the food was good but way expensive i paid over 50 for 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine  nngot back to my room  clicked on my recorded shows to find  technical error so they hadnt recorded after all  bummernnso in the morning imagine my surprise when the coffee machine in the room requires you to pay 3 for the actual coffee to put in it  ive stayed in many 35 star hotels and have never run in to something that audacious  put the coffee maker there then make you pay for itnni decided then and there this place would not get any more of my money and checked out at 9am  i will not return nor recommend this resort to anyone else and im a local who goes out frequently enjoys staycations and refers guests to local hotels this one is off the list,2
its a small place family owned and operated  clean and great service,4
the worst experience ever my first time going to this place was terrible it literally took 16 minutes for one chicken taco and chips when i finally received the taco it had a piece of metal in it the chicken was cold and looked weird i will never return because its not clean and the food is awful,0
i was highly disappointed with this place i have never been treated so badly in las vegas in my life especially with me being a girl nnfirst of all we werent even planning to go to their club but their promoter kept pushing it so we agreed to give it a shot ive only been to the bank at the bellagio and that place sucks so i was willing to give this a shot when we got into the hotel we were stopped by another promoter which i guess was the promoter for the bank and he kept pushing it and we kindly declined and asked where hyde was located at that point he was extremely rude so that didnt help and i shot back with some wise comments which are too inappropriate to repeat on here and stormed off nnsince it was me my other female friend and our guy friend we just walked up to the front and showed the bouncer our passes he smiled and told us we would get in right away however right when he saw our guy friend he asked if he was with us and we said yes and instantly his demeanor changed and told us to get in line i was absolutely disgusted i have never had that happen before and i have never had to wait in line to get into a club in vegas before pissed off my female friend and i went to a different bouncer who wished me a happy birthday it was my birthday weekend stamped our hand and let us in eventually i would never recommend this place to anyone and the club wasnt even that great anyways,0
a couple of years ago we had a tankless system installed by another firm that did a faulty job which could have caused major damage to our property we contacted the water heater man who coordinated with noritz to obtain a warranty replacement for us they properly installed and inspected the new unit and ventilation we experienced a,4

our dinner at guy savoy last night was exceptional as the establishment has set the standard for fine dining the food was exquisite particularly the lobster foie gras and artichoke truffle soup the presentation of the dishes was beautiful and the food was undeniably the star of the show,4
i bought a groupon for this place when a few friends and i planned to have lunch im glad i had the groupon because i dont think their offerings and customer service are worth paying full price for i got a caesar wrap a sunrise smoothie and a kids pizza meal with an extra kid smoothie the girl behind the counter couldnt answer any of my questions about the smoothies i asked a simple question like the difference between supercharged ones and indulgent ones and she just said she didnt know not very helpful they also forgot the extra kids smoothie and when i asked about it the staff member said theyd bring it but no one ever did after my meal i asked for a refund but no one brought it out ill only go back to use my last two vouchers and will probably just get smoothies and avoid the food i noticed they have a good happy hour deal on smoothies so if i visit again without a groupon id probably go during that special,1
this place is dreadful with a single roll of sushi costing almost 17 and being of the same inferior quality as those found at vons it would be wiser to get your sushi fix at a convenience store instead of here as they offer better quality,0
a delicious filled pastry required additional sauce however im simply fond of sauces and ill return for a standard pie while sitting near the ovens in a warmer dining area next time,3
