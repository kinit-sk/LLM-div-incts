in summary the reviewer believes that sams town is neither the best nor the worst place and it caters to locals among the casinos on boulder highway the reviewer prefers sams town the most,2
its a small place family owned and operated  clean and great service,4
my first time at this place was the worst experience ever i waited for 16 minutes just to get a chicken taco and some chips and when i finally got it there was a piece of metal inside the chicken was cold and looked weird because of this i will never go back there again because its not clean and the food is awful,0
the okay store currently has many empty shelves making it a helpful reference when contrasting with other asian supermarkets im thinking of going to another store,1
i ordered a desk and small cabinet online and was told i could pick them up in two days when i went to pick up my items it took them 15 minutes to locate my furniture the box for the smaller cabinet was severely damaged while the desk box appeared fine when i assembled both pieces at home i found that both were damaged,0
horrible customer service  came here for an alignment and because they though it would take more than an hour they wanted me to return tomorrow i understand that it might take them 1020 mins after their operating hours but come on go the extra mile a bit for your customer horrible customer service,0
my first encounter at that place was horrible they took 16 minutes to bring me a chicken taco and chips which were both unpleasant and included a metal piece i wont be revisiting due to the unclean environment and inadequate food quality,0
in summary sams town is not the best nor the worst casino it is a local hotel that primarily attracts residents and rodeo visitors out of all the establishments on boulder highway the author prefers this casino the most,2
i was utterly disappointed by my experience at this location in las veg,0
this establishment is horrible  a single roll will set you back nearly 17 and the quality is no better than what youd find at vons youll find superior sushi at a convenience store so avoid this place at all costs,0
this location is dreadful a single roll costs nearly 17 with the same substandard quality youd find at vons you can find superior sushi at a convenience store so steer clear of this place,0
the burger was exceptional while the fries and shake were mediocre yet because the establishment is famous for its burgers i would return solely for that reason,2
i gave this place a twostar rating because i left there around 20 minutes ago and i havent thrown up yet but the pho is really bad especially considering its price,1
seeing the affiliation with bobby flay immediately sparked my interest but bobbys burger palace just barely lived up to its namesake although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh the burger was not anything extraordinary nnmy boyfriend had the vegas burger which was definitely more unique with red chilies and bbq chips that gave an extra crunch i ordered the la burger with chicken breast which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings the chicken was cooked really well but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom so i was holding onto mush by the end of my burger overall the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special we also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries which came with great dipping sauces chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce they also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeu00f1o sauce nnif youre looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the strip bobbys burger palace can tide you over for a little bit but i would recommend checking out other more noteworthy spots when youre in a city filled with amazing food,2
awful client service went in for a wheel alignment and was asked to return the next day because it could take more than an hour while i comprehend the time constraint it would have been nice if they went the extra mile for the customer horrendous customer service,0
steiners lets chat you provide food and permit cigarette smoking but cigars cross the line for nonsmokers however theres no difference between them  both have an odor cigarette smoke adheres to everything hair clothes hands and especially the room in contrast i can smoke a cigar indoors and an hour later theres no scent please a reply or a yelp post would be appreciated,1
terrible customer support  visited for a wheel alignment but they suggested coming back tomorrow since it might take over an hour i understand the time frame but why not put in extra effort for customers abysmal service,0
i am usually open to giving a company a second chance however my second visit was even more unsatisfactory than the first the manicure and pedicure i received were done by two individuals who were incredibly rude it would be wise to save your time and money and go to a different spa to have a pleasant experience as you may not have a good time here,0
i ordered a variety of dips and appetizers and the crab dip with pita chips were incredible but the guacamole was disappointing it had a processed taste and wasnt fresh ive had the fish tacos with a fruity drink before and they were amazing despite that the atmosphere and food overall are great,2
steiners could we discuss something while you provide food and permit cigarette smoking which can be offensive to nonsmokers cigars are an even bigger issue the truth is both have a smell that sticks to hair clothes hands and the room yet after smoking a cigar indoors for an hour theres no lingering odor please respond or post on,1
the place is small owned and managed by a family wellmaintained and offers great customer service,4
a gorgeously designed casino with intricate embellishments and sculptures although they took more money from me than i did from them my gambling experience here was just average,2
a local casino offers a more laidback gaming experience without the usual flashing lights and loud noises the entrance features a subway and an ice cream parlor making it feel quite normal and not fancy recently a wwe summer slam ppv event was screened in the tournament room with a 5 cover charge including concessions like hot dogs nachos and two beers the food was decent prices were reasonable and seating was plentiful and wellplaced some attendees mentioned reserved seats but good visibility and hearing were experienced even from seats 13 rows back,3
the movie theaters at sams town are praised for being nice and wellmaintained with low crowds making them ideal for solo moviegoers the casino also features sheplers a great place for western wear in las vegas the reviewer is wary of the restaurants due to experiencing an upset stomach after eating at tgi fridays but notes that willy joses offers bottomless margaritas,2
ordered a few different dips and appetizers  the crab dip with pita chips were amazing but the guacamole was less than impressive  it tasted like processed guacnothing fresh about it  ive had the fish tacos with a fruity drink in the past and they were delicious  great atmosphere and food overall,2
we had lunch at this place on a weekday and while the food was passable the service was so poor that it made the experience quite unpleasant we gave it 2 stars because we had to wait almost half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies in a nearly empty restaurant if youre okay with repeating your order and having them mess it up you could give this place a try however since we dont have much time for lunch during workdays we wont be coming back,1
the casino is a fantastic local spot for more lowkey gaming without the usual bright flashing lights and loud obnoxious noises associated with casinos it has a subway and an ice cream parlor at the entrance giving it a normal and nonfancy vibe,3
hey steiners lets chat you serve food and allow smoking cigarettes but cigars bother nonsmokers both smell and cigarettes linger on hair clothes hands and rooms after smoking a cigar indoors for an hour theres no smell can you reply or post on yelp,1
i was excited to finally try lil brown sugar cupcakes after reading the reviews my only disappointment was i did not go sooner that day nnwe arrived in the afternoon and the display case was pretty scarce a lady greeted us owner and explained that she had much of her supply sell out that morning of course my first thought is it must be good she still had some red velvets strawberry lemonades and one lonely triple chocolate cupcake left we request one of each except the red velvet other items there were chocolate chip cookies gooey bars and brownies nnhow did the cupcakes taste amazing i cant remember the last cupcake that was as moist and tasteful im one of those cupcake eaters who only like a tiny bit of frosting however this frosting was great not overly sweet and overpowering she told us the strawberry lemonade was her most popular and now i can see why what was i thinking just getting one nnill definitely be back to try her other flavors including the red velvet even maybe for her gooey bar which she let us samplenni highly recommend giving lil brown sugar a visit next time you want an amazing cupcake,3
guy savoy established the benchmark for highquality dining and our dinner the previous night was exceptional the cuisine was truly outstanding particularly the lobster foie gras and artichoke truffe soup the plating was also visually stunning with the food undeniably being the highlight of the meal,4
this place is really bad the sushi which costs almost 17 is no better in quality than the ones youd get at vons you can actually find better sushi at a convenience store so its best to avoid this place,0
this review focuses on various aspects of the casino such as the movie theaters a few stores and the fact that the reviewer has been a regular since childhood sams town has a long history including an album named after it the casino is wellsuited for locals and cowboys and it has a western theme however the reviewer feels that it has declined in recent years,2
requested a variety of dips and appetizers the crab dip accompanied by pita chips exceeded expectations but the guacamole was underwhelming having a processed taste and lacking in fresh ingredients on a previous occasion the fish tacos paired with a fruity beverage were delightful the ambiance and food in general are commendable,2
after being enticed into a contract with a scam company who took my money and failed to deliver i found my credit was erroneously marred this company had been barred from half of the us by state attorney generals for disreputable business dealings however i couldnt get their bogus collection claims off my credit report scott coached me from start to finish and eventually guided me to seek legal support the attorney provided the extra push to get a letter of deletion which has cleared my credit report of all derogatory information scott gave me the guidance and support to keep going and prevail against the credit demons,4
my initial experience at the establishment was quite terrible as it took an extended period of 16 minutes to receive a chicken taco and chips which were both unappetizing and had a metal fragment i refuse to return due to the unsanitary conditions and inferior food,0
the association with bobby flay initially attracted me to bobbys burger palace but the restaurant only marginally met my expectations the prices were reasonable and the,2
very beutiful casino filled with ornate decorations and statues they won more from me than i did from them but other than that my gambling experience here was mediocre,2
i would have liked the delicious stuffed meat pie to have more sauce but maybe thats just me being a bit saucy ill definitely come back next time for a regular pie and ill make sure to sit closer to the ovens in the warmer part of the dining area,3
a budgetfriendly eatery for breakfast with the added bonus of being able to bring your dog along my favorite aspect is that your furry friend can enjoy the patio with you the breakfast menu was straightforward but its not necessarily a drawback i opted for a small stack of whole wheat pancakes and a side of hashbrowns while my date had cinnamon challah french toast the portion size was perfect  i could finish all three pancakes without wasting food the hashbrowns were crispy and wellseasoned as for the french toast it was a little dry but syrup,3
my initial experience at this establishment was nothing short of dreadful it took an agonizing 16 minutes to receive a single chicken taco and some chips to make matters worse the taco contained a piece of metal the chicken was cold and appeared unusual consequently i will never set foot in that place again due to its unhygienic conditions and substandard food,0
the worst experience ever my first time going was not fun it literally took 16 minutes for one chicken taco and chips when i finally got the taco it had a piece of metal in it the chicken was cold and looked weird i will never go there because its not clean and the food suck,0
the establishment is tiny run by a family and offers tidy surroundings and excellent service,4
i had a terrible experience at this hotel i prepaid for a onenight stay for my friends 50th birthday but she got sick and we had to cancel when i called the hotel to ask if we could change the date they refused the staff was unhelpful and the hotel was mostly empty despite being told it was fully committed the room was far from the main areas and i felt uncomfortable as a solo female traveler the food was good but expensive and the coffee machine required additional payment for the coffee i wont be returning or recommending this hotel,2
i bought a groupon for this place when a few friends and i planned to have lunch im glad i had the groupon because i dont think their offerings and customer service are worth paying full price for i got a caesar wrap a sunrise smoothie and a kids pizza meal with an extra kid smoothie the girl behind the counter couldnt answer any of my questions about the smoothies i asked a simple question like the difference between supercharged ones and indulgent ones and she just said she didnt know not very helpful they also forgot the extra kids smoothie and when i asked about it the staff member said theyd bring it but no one ever did after my meal i asked for a refund but no one brought it out ill only go back to use my last two vouchers and will probably just get smoothies and avoid the food i noticed they have a good happy hour deal on smoothies so if i visit again without a groupon id probably go during that special,1
following an unfortunate incident where i was tricked into signing a contract with a fraudulent company that stole my money and didnt deliver the promised service i discovered that my credit had been incorrectly tarnished this particular company had already been banned from operating in half of the us due to their shady business practices regardless i was unable to get their illegitimate collection claims removed from my credit report scott played an integral role in guiding me through the entire process and eventually advised me to seek legal support the attorney provided the necessary boost to secure a letter of deletion which ultimately cleared my credit report of any negative information scotts guidance and support gave me the strength to continue fighting and ultimately triumph over the credit demons,4

our lunch experience on a weekday was marred by poor service despite the food not being terrible we waited for almost 30 minutes for just two sandwiches and two smoothies in an empty restaurant the service was so bad that we had to repeat our order multiple times and they still got it wrong with only an hour for lunch during workdays we wont be coming back to this place,1
i really enjoy the delicious food and the ambiance and the decor is fantastic i especially loved the steamed bbq pork buns and the bbq platter which had duck pork and chicken,4
the luxurious casino filled with lavish ornaments and statues caused me to lose more than i won however aside from that my gambling experience at the establishment was middling,2
after observing the long queue at steak n shake we made a swift uturn and opted for chinese food as our stomachs told us to sit and eat my parents enjoy the chinese food here and since we felt a bit queasy we opted for wonton soup egg rolls and a side salad the soup was acceptable with a flavorful,1
this review is based on a few things the casino itself the movie theaters a few stores and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since i was a small childnnsams town has been around for a long time and even has an album named after it if you dont know the artist just look it up its a good ol western themed place plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo on that level the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars but i think its gone down hill in the past couple yearsnnhere are some good things the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept theyre hardly ever really busy which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourselfnnsams town also has sheplers which is a great place to find western wear in las vegasnni am weary of the restaurants here as i experienced an upset tummy after eating at the tgi fridays the mexican place here is called willy  joses and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now  but i have yet to indulgennits not the best place nor is it the worst it is a locals hotel and out of all the places on boulder highway i like this casino the best,2
during a weekday lunch visit the food wasnt terrible but the service was disappointing leading to a 2star rating we waited nearly half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies in an empty establishment if youre willing to repeat your order three times and deal with mixups you might consider trying this place due to limited time for lunch during workdays we wont be returning,1
awful customer service i came here for an alignment and they wanted me to come back the next day since it would take over an hour while i understand it might take 1020 minutes past their operating hours it would be nice if they went the extra mile for their customers horrible customer service,0

i was thrilled to finally try lil brown sugar cupcakes after reading the reviews but my only disappointment was that i didnt go sooner when we arrived in the afternoon the display case was quite empty and the owner explained that most of her supply had sold out that morning this made me think that they must be really good she still had some red velvet strawberry lemonade and a single triple chocolate cupcake left we requested one of each except for the red velvet other items available were chocolate chip cookies gooey bars and brownies the cupcakes were amazing – moist and flavorful i cant remember the last cupcake that tasted as good i usually prefer a small amount of frosting but this frosting was perfect – not too sweet or overpowering the strawberry lemonade was her most popular flavor and now i can see why i wish i had gotten more than just one i will definitely be back to try her other flavors including the red velvet and maybe even her gooey bar which she let us sample i highly recommend giving lil brown sugar a visit next time you want an incredible cupcake,3
