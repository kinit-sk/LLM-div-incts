1,we visited this eatery for a weekday lunch and found the cuisine satisfactory but the service was lacking our rating would be 2 stars due to the long wait for simple sandwiches and smoothies in an uncrowded venue if youre willing to reiterate your order multiple times and tolerate mixups you might consider giving this place a try however due to our limited lunch break we wont be returning,we were here for lunch during a weekday  the food isnt bad but the service makes the whole experience 2 stars  we waited for almost half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies and the place was emptynif you dont mind repeating your order 3 times and having them mess upforget your order you could give this place a try  since we usually dont have more than an hour for lunch break during a work day we will not be coming back never
1,for a weekday lunch we decided to eat at this establishment and while the dishes were decent the service left much to be desired we would rate the overall experience as 2 stars because of the prolonged wait for our meal despite the lack of customers if youre okay with repeating your requests and dealing with order errors you may want to give this place a chance however due to our time constraints we wont be coming back,we were here for lunch during a weekday  the food isnt bad but the service makes the whole experience 2 stars  we waited for almost half an hour for two sandwiches and two smoothies and the place was emptynif you dont mind repeating your order 3 times and having them mess upforget your order you could give this place a try  since we usually dont have more than an hour for lunch break during a work day we will not be coming back never

2,requested a selection of varied dips and starters the crab dip with pita chips was phenomenal but the guacamole was underwhelming seeming artificial rather than fresh despite this the fish tacos paired with a fruity beverage were delectable on a previous visit and the overall ambiance and cuisine are excellent,ordered a few different dips and appetizers  the crab dip with pita chips were amazing but the guacamole was less than impressive  it tasted like processed guacnothing fresh about it  ive had the fish tacos with a fruity drink in the past and they were delicious  great atmosphere and food overall

2,this evaluation is founded on multiple aspects including the casino movie theaters a few stores and my personal experience as a regular visitor since childhood the establishment sams town has been in operation for quite some time and has even inspired an album it has a western theme and primarily caters to locals and cowboys who attend the rodeo on this basis i would give the casino 3 stars but i feel it has declined in recent years,this review is based on a few things the casino itself the movie theaters a few stores and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since i was a small childnnsams town has been around for a long time and even has an album named after it if you dont know the artist just look it up its a good ol western themed place plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo on that level the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars but i think its gone down hill in the past couple yearsnnhere are some good things the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept theyre hardly ever really busy which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourselfnnsams town also has sheplers which is a great place to find western wear in las vegasnni am weary of the restaurants here as i experienced an upset tummy after eating at the tgi fridays the mexican place here is called willy  joses and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now  but i have yet to indulgennits not the best place nor is it the worst it is a locals hotel and out of all the places on boulder highway i like this casino the best
2,some positive features include wellmaintained and rarely crowded movie theaters as well as sheplers an excellent store for western wear in las vegas however i am hesitant to recommend the restaurants as i had an unpleasant experience at tgi fridays willy joses a mexican eatery currently offers bottomless margaritas but i have not tried it,this review is based on a few things the casino itself the movie theaters a few stores and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since i was a small childnnsams town has been around for a long time and even has an album named after it if you dont know the artist just look it up its a good ol western themed place plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo on that level the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars but i think its gone down hill in the past couple yearsnnhere are some good things the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept theyre hardly ever really busy which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourselfnnsams town also has sheplers which is a great place to find western wear in las vegasnni am weary of the restaurants here as i experienced an upset tummy after eating at the tgi fridays the mexican place here is called willy  joses and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now  but i have yet to indulgennits not the best place nor is it the worst it is a locals hotel and out of all the places on boulder highway i like this casino the best
2,in conclusion sams town is neither the best nor the worst option in the area as a local hotel it is my preferred choice among the establishments on boulder highway,this review is based on a few things the casino itself the movie theaters a few stores and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since i was a small childnnsams town has been around for a long time and even has an album named after it if you dont know the artist just look it up its a good ol western themed place plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo on that level the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars but i think its gone down hill in the past couple yearsnnhere are some good things the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept theyre hardly ever really busy which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourselfnnsams town also has sheplers which is a great place to find western wear in las vegasnni am weary of the restaurants here as i experienced an upset tummy after eating at the tgi fridays the mexican place here is called willy  joses and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now  but i have yet to indulgennits not the best place nor is it the worst it is a locals hotel and out of all the places on boulder highway i like this casino the best
2,when i saw that bobby flay was affiliated with the restaurant it piqued my interest but sadly bobbys burger palace only just met expectations despite reasonable pricing and fresh ingredients my boyfriend had the vegas burger which stood out with red chilies and bbq chips for added crunch i ordered the la burger made with chicken breast guacamole and standard toppings the chicken was cooked well but the cheddar cheese reminded me of storebought slices and the bun became soggy making it hard to hold the burgers were satisfactory but nothing special we also got half sweet potato fries and half regular fries with great dipping sauces like chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce they had a variety of sauces for burgers and fries such as chipotle ketchup and jalapeño sauce,seeing the affiliation with bobby flay immediately sparked my interest but bobbys burger palace just barely lived up to its namesake although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh the burger was not anything extraordinary nnmy boyfriend had the vegas burger which was definitely more unique with red chilies and bbq chips that gave an extra crunch i ordered the la burger with chicken breast which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings the chicken was cooked really well but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom so i was holding onto mush by the end of my burger overall the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special we also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries which came with great dipping sauces chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce they also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeu00f1o sauce nnif youre looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the strip bobbys burger palace can tide you over for a little bit but i would recommend checking out other more noteworthy spots when youre in a city filled with amazing food

2,i was deeply disappointed with my experience at the hotel i had prepaid for a night with my friend for her 50th birthday unfortunately she fell ill with strep throat and couldnt join me so i tried to reschedule our stay i called the hotel explained the situation and asked if we could transfer the booking to another date but they refused i decided to go alone to not lose the money i had invested when i arrived i was met with a valet parking attendant who pressured me to valet park my vehicle before i had even checked in i had to argue with her to explain why i wanted to check in first before giving her my car its a good thing i did because the parking is included in the resort fee and it was a selfparking spot right next to the valet area meaning it would have been the same walk to my room from either place when i finally said i wanted to check in first i was chastised by the attendant with a remark that it shouldnt take me more than 5 minutes because i couldnt leave my car there longer than that i was taken aback by the experience i had to walk a long distance to find my room which was in a remote area of the hotel far from the main areas it was located on the end in a somewhat dark,so disappointed with this hotel  i prepaid a trip there for one night with my friend for her 50th bd and she came down with strep throat that morning so had to cancel on me  i called the hotel explaining and asking if we could transfer to another date spend our money there at the spa and restaurants just on another date and was met with a resounding nonnso i went alone to not lose the investment  nni was met with a valet parking attendant putting a high pressure on me to valet park my vehicle before id even checked in  i had to practically argue with her to explain why i wanted to check in first before turning my car over to valet  good thing i did because the parking is included in the exorbitant resort fee self parking and its directly adjacent to the valet  meaning it would have been the same long walk to my room from either locale  when i finally said id like to check in before deciding i was chastised with this well it better not take you more than 5 minutes because you cant leave your car here longer than that  i was floored  i was in a spacious entry area with exactly one other car  this was my bad first impressionnni walked quite a distance to find my room which was very far from the main areas of the hotel  it was on the end in a kind of dark creepy low area which i did not feel comfortable with before setting in i called the front desk asking if they perhaps had a second floor unit as a solo female traveler would feel more comfortable  i was met with no we are fully commited tonite and shot down  nni then left my room to explore and was met with a big spacious ghost town  certainly not a feel of a place fully commited  i saw rows and rows of rooms clearly unoccupied and it was 5pm  i knew id been lied to  perhaps it was because i had prepurchased my stay at a  discount  i would have preferred the honestly on that  that you get lesser desired rooms by going that route  nnthe rooms are gorgeous  the tv is great and i was so delighted to see they actually have a dvr which will record your shows  so i set it to record 2 shows ventured out to the restaurant where i was literally one of 3 people sitting at the bar to eat the restaurant itself looked about 14 filledat 8pm on a sun night  the food was good but way expensive i paid over 50 for 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine  nngot back to my room  clicked on my recorded shows to find  technical error so they hadnt recorded after all  bummernnso in the morning imagine my surprise when the coffee machine in the room requires you to pay 3 for the actual coffee to put in it  ive stayed in many 35 star hotels and have never run in to something that audacious  put the coffee maker there then make you pay for itnni decided then and there this place would not get any more of my money and checked out at 9am  i will not return nor recommend this resort to anyone else and im a local who goes out frequently enjoys staycations and refers guests to local hotels this one is off the list
2,the sandwich was fantastic the potatoes were average and the milkshake was average but since the restaurant is renowned for its sandwiches i would return solely for that,the burger was excellent the fries were meh the shake was meh but the place is known for burgers so i would go back for that alone
2,the patty melt was outstanding the side of fries was just okay and the thick milkshake was nothing special however the establishment is famous for its patty melts so i would revisit for that particular dish,the burger was excellent the fries were meh the shake was meh but the place is known for burgers so i would go back for that alone
2,the cheeseburger was incredible the crinkle fries were mediocre and the ice cream drink was passable yet the eatery is celebrated for its cheeseburgers thus i would come back for that specific reason,the burger was excellent the fries were meh the shake was meh but the place is known for burgers so i would go back for that alone
3,a budgetfriendly breakfast place where you can bring your dog on the patio my favorite part is having your pooch with you while enjoying your meal the breakfast was simple but not disappointing i had a short stack of whole wheat pancakes and a side of hashbrowns while my date ordered the cinnamon challah french toast the portion size was perfect for me since i have a small appetite it only cost 350 and was well worth it the hashbrowns were cooked to perfection and wellseasoned the french toast was a bit dry but syrup fixed that and the toppings of almonds and berries were a great addition my iced vanilla latte was delicious and my dog appreciated the cooling misters on the patio highly recommended,a delicious affordable place to go for breakfastand my favorite part your pooch can enjoy the patio with you  breakfast was very straightforward but thats not necessarily a bad thing  i chose a short stack of whole wheat pancakes and a side of hashbrowns while my date chose the cinnamon challah french toast  my order was perfection simply because of the portion sizethe pancakes were much smaller than those in the full order and came with three  i was actually able to eat them all instead of wasting a lot as i normally do with a small appetiteand for 350 it was fantastic  the hashbrowns were also crisp and well seasoned  as for the french toast other reviewers have described it and i agree with them  a little dry but nothing a dousing of syrup cant cure  the crunchy almonds and fresh berries on top are a great touchnnmy iced vanilla latte was delicious and my pup enjoyed the misters on the patio  definitely recommended
