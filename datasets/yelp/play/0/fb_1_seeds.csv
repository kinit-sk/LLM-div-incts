2,ill paraphrase the original text a person was disappointed with a hotel they prepaid for a onenight stay with a friend for her 50th birthday however the friend got sick and the hotel wouldnt let them change the date or refund the money the person went alone and the valet parking attendant was pushy about valet parking before checking in the room was far from the main areas and felt unsafe the hotel lied about being fully committed and seemed like a ghost town the food was expensive and the recorded shows didnt work in the morning the coffee machine required payment for the coffee the person wont return or recommend this resort,so disappointed with this hotel  i prepaid a trip there for one night with my friend for her 50th bd and she came down with strep throat that morning so had to cancel on me  i called the hotel explaining and asking if we could transfer to another date spend our money there at the spa and restaurants just on another date and was met with a resounding nonnso i went alone to not lose the investment  nni was met with a valet parking attendant putting a high pressure on me to valet park my vehicle before id even checked in  i had to practically argue with her to explain why i wanted to check in first before turning my car over to valet  good thing i did because the parking is included in the exorbitant resort fee self parking and its directly adjacent to the valet  meaning it would have been the same long walk to my room from either locale  when i finally said id like to check in before deciding i was chastised with this well it better not take you more than 5 minutes because you cant leave your car here longer than that  i was floored  i was in a spacious entry area with exactly one other car  this was my bad first impressionnni walked quite a distance to find my room which was very far from the main areas of the hotel  it was on the end in a kind of dark creepy low area which i did not feel comfortable with before setting in i called the front desk asking if they perhaps had a second floor unit as a solo female traveler would feel more comfortable  i was met with no we are fully commited tonite and shot down  nni then left my room to explore and was met with a big spacious ghost town  certainly not a feel of a place fully commited  i saw rows and rows of rooms clearly unoccupied and it was 5pm  i knew id been lied to  perhaps it was because i had prepurchased my stay at a  discount  i would have preferred the honestly on that  that you get lesser desired rooms by going that route  nnthe rooms are gorgeous  the tv is great and i was so delighted to see they actually have a dvr which will record your shows  so i set it to record 2 shows ventured out to the restaurant where i was literally one of 3 people sitting at the bar to eat the restaurant itself looked about 14 filledat 8pm on a sun night  the food was good but way expensive i paid over 50 for 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine  nngot back to my room  clicked on my recorded shows to find  technical error so they hadnt recorded after all  bummernnso in the morning imagine my surprise when the coffee machine in the room requires you to pay 3 for the actual coffee to put in it  ive stayed in many 35 star hotels and have never run in to something that audacious  put the coffee maker there then make you pay for itnni decided then and there this place would not get any more of my money and checked out at 9am  i will not return nor recommend this resort to anyone else and im a local who goes out frequently enjoys staycations and refers guests to local hotels this one is off the list
