0,to my disappointment the establishment didnt have an extensive variety of food for the price we paid furthermore i was unhappy when they charged us a compulsory gratuity fee just because we were seated near a family member the server even inquired if we knew her and then insisted on the fee it didnt make sense that we had to pay the fee when there were other tables around us that the server also had to attend to the server couldnt explain the reasoning behind this charge and as a result we couldnt enjoy our dinner we left feeling disappointed as we had anticipated a great experience at the wicked spoon,not impressed at all thought they would have a better selection of food with the price  that you pay i was really upset that we got charged a mandatory gratuity fee because a family member was seated next to us the waitress asked if we knew her and when we said yes the waitress automatically insisted that we pay this mandatory gratuity i mean doesnt she have to wait on the other tables surrounding us it made no sense and she wouldnt or couldnt explain the theory behind it after paying this  mandatory gratuity we couldnt enjoy our dinner and decide to leave i was really looking forward to the wicked spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had it just didnt happen

0,to be honest im unsure about giving this place a rating the only reason i would consider giving them any stars is because they have some nice home furnishings however the customer service is the worst ive ever encountered when i bought a long oak table i didnt receive any assistance in getting it to my van i asked for help and the staff member simply said it was against their policy i inquired further about this policy and the employee only reiterated that it was for their safety but then they didnt even open the door for me thankfully a kind customer offered to help me carry the table and load it into my van so if youre okay with terrible customer service you may like some of their furniture,i am actually not sure what to rate this place so ill write first  if i would give this any stars at all it would be because they have some decent home furnishings  i bought a very long oak table and had no help whatsover getting it out to my van  i asked for help and the girl just said no we cant its policy  i asked her why it was policy and she just said its policy  after pressing the issue as to why she finally said it was for the employees safety  thats reasonable  but guess what she didnt even open the door for me  geeeeeze louisea very sweet customer offered to help and also offered to carry it with me and put it in the van with me  how sweet is that  random acts of kindness  soooo if you dont care if they treat you like crap go for it  i do like some of their stuffbut their customer service is the worst ive ever experienced
