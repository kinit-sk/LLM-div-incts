1,several years back i was quite fond of eating establishments such as fridays chilis applebees and their equivalents however nowadays my preferences have grown and im less enamored with these places as opposed to dining out i would rather expend my spare funds on familyowned ventures run by people who invest their hearts and souls into their businesses houlihans was never a spot i frequented even when i did visit casual dining establishments often the food was never wellprepared in my view these restaurants seemed to copy each others menus and houlihans never seemed to find its niche they offer dishes that are not particularly special i once had a salmon dish that was underseasoned overcooked and dry served with green beans and rice it was quite unremarkable dining at houlihans is akin to taking your cousin to the prom it doesnt excite me in the least,many years ago i was in love with the idea of restaurants like fridays chilis applebees and the like not so much today as my tastes in food matures besides cooking at home id much rather spend my disposable income on family owned businesses people who put their heart and souls into their business nnhoulihans was never my to go to place even when i was frequenting these so called casual dining spots the food was never well done in my opinion but then again these restaurants always seemed to copy each others menus houlihans just never caught their niche they basically just serve dishes that are nothing special ive had the salmon completely under seasoned overcooked and dry served  with green beans and rice is that beaver cleevers mother cooking back there it was pretty unremarkable  nnhoulihans will always be like taking your cousin to the prom it doesnt excite me at all

1,every time i walked by tin tin it was always crowded so i finally went in expecting amazing food due to the high prices they charge for their buffet however i was disappointed because the food was not impressive they had numerous food stations but none of the dishes were outstanding the food was tasteless and the seafood was unappetizing i wont return and i suggest that if you havent been there before save your time and dont bother,i always passed by tin tin and it is always packed so i finally made it in and expecting great food i was disappointed for the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better the food did not stand out they had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about the food was bland and the seafood was sucky i will not go back and i advise if you never been there dont waste your time
1,i frequently saw tin tin packed with people so i assumed the food must be incredible since they charge a lot for their buffet unfortunately i was let down when i finally visited because the food wasnt remarkable despite having numerous stations none of the dishes were exceptional the food lacked flavor and the seafood was unsatisfactory i will not be going back and i advise that if you havent experienced tin tin dont waste your time,i always passed by tin tin and it is always packed so i finally made it in and expecting great food i was disappointed for the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better the food did not stand out they had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about the food was bland and the seafood was sucky i will not go back and i advise if you never been there dont waste your time

1,i was extremely impressed with the tacos which were the best ive had in las vegas however they were quite pricey the first time i visited this place i went to the drivethrough where the prices were shown on a banner a taco was listed for 250 which i thought was acceptable considering the positive reviews about the food i ordered two carne asada tacos and the cashier asked if i wanted everything on them i replied yes and she informed me that the total would be 990 i thought there must have been a mistake since 10 bucks for two tacos seemed ridiculous i pulled up paid and was given my receipt i discovered i was charged an extra 150 per taco for the everything which included sour cream salsa and guacamole i paid it but felt it was a total ripoff especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drivethrough banner not being very honest if you ask me i give 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising,i was very impressed with the tacos the best i have had in las vegas however very pricey the first time i tried this place i went to the drive through prices showed on the banner for a taco was 250 so i thought ok not bad i have heard good things about the food here so i ordered 2 carne asada tacos  the cashier asks would you like everything on it i reply yes so she tells me that will be 990 i think to myself there has to be a mistake maybe she heard me wrong 10 bucks for 2 tacos thats crazy so i pull up i pay she gives me my receipt i was charged an extra 150 per taco for the everything on each one the sour cream salsa and guacamole i paid it but i totally think that is a total rip off especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drive thru banner not being very honest if you ask me 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising

1,if you enjoy unappetizing nursing home food youll adore kings fish house their quality is comparable to restaurants on the verge of appearing on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to greet us we were about 2 minutes away from leaving when she finally showed up she was clearly indifferent and just going through the motions the sourdough bread served was extremely sour even for someone who enjoys sourdough after consulting my seafood guide i ordered the parmesancrusted alaskan sanddab with garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as sides my meal arrived with the fish piping hot but the sides were stone cold the fish was not seasoned and lacked the promised lemon sauce making it a bland slightly oily mess the mac and cheese was not only cold but flavorless while the garlic mash was just okay my husband had the fish and chips and im pretty sure the cod was frozen the fries were edible but nothing special our waitress wasnt very friendly but went through the motions i observed her playing with her mouth and lips after i ate which was gross another server pushed a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest,if you like bad nursing home food then you will love kings fish house seriously they are minutes away from being on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us i had just said that if we wait another 5 minutes i was going to walk out we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived she was very apathetic and it was obvious she was just going through the motions we were served some extremely sour sourdough bread for the record i enjoy sourdough but this was almost inedible after consulting my seafood watch card i settled on the parmesan crusted alaskan sanddab i chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides when my meal arrived the fish was piping hot and the sides were stone cold the fish was not too bad there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing because it would have actually been a good dish otherwise unfortunately it was a bland slightly oily mess i could almost hear gordon ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning the mac and cheese was not only cold but completely flavorless the garlic mash was ok but nothing special my husband had the fish and chips i am pretty sure the cod was frozen and the fries again were edible but nothing spectacular nnour waitress was not very friendly but she went through the motions i did observe her playing with her mouth and lips after i had eaten which completely grossed me out i observed another server push a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest this plate of food was full and on its way to a patron again i could hear gordon screaming in my head just set the plate downnnkings is a dinosaur in the dining world they are stuck in an era that no longer exists people want flavor not food that they can cook themselves at home and a better version at that the place was almost empty on a friday night and many of the patrons were very senior kings really needs to modernize if they hope to survive in this foodie city

2,on our first visit we went to a mexican restaurant on a sunday and although the brunch buffet looked tempting we decided to order what we wanted from the menu despite the appealing appearance of the buffet they didnt have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles instead everything tasted good and the menu had a variety of options we would likely return if given the chance however one of our party members mom didnt have any posole in her muendo which we initially thought was a unique preparation but later found out it was just bad luck the bus boy who was friendlier than the waiter informed us that the muendo on the buffet had homemie additionally when comparing this restaurant to what we considered a 5star mexican restaurant casa garcias in anaheim ca we felt the food was not on par although the atmosphere was nicer overall it was a good visit but we are more critical in our evaluation of mexican restaurants it was interesting to note that the owner timoteo barajas shares the same name as mine,we visited on a sunday and probably should have gone with the brunch buffet but as it was our first visit we ordered what we wanted everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles both dishes were good in fact everthing looked good on the menu i would probbly go back if i ever had the chancenn so why not more stars mom who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl we were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu as it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it the other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star mexican restaurant and we agreed it was casa garcias in anaheim ca this was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here in all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of mexican nnon a side note it was interesting to note that the owner was named timoteo barajas which is the same as mine

2,im a frequent golfer here having played a few times recently and i always appreciate how wellmaintained the course is the desert elements make it quite a challenge and the driving range provides a great view of northeast scottsdale however there are some power lines along the edges of the course which can be distracting and detract from the overall experience although its not the best course in the area i still recommend trying it out if youre looking for a new golfing experience in northeast scottsdale,played here a couple times most recently this past weekend the course is always in good shape when ive been out there and it is challenging with the desert being in play throughout the coursennthe driving range gives you a great view of northeast scottsdale while youre warming up and you get just about the same great view off of the 10 tee the course is challenging enough for most people as youre playing with desert on a lot of holes nnthe negative is that it is a tad annoying playing amongst the string of power lines that are placed along the outskirts of the course it just makes for an awkward appearance and when youre trying to line up your shot that numbing buzz of the electricity can be an unwelcome distractionnnis this a great course in my opinion no there are far better ones around the valley that you can go and play but i recommend playing here if you havent before and youre looking for a new track in ne scottsdale
