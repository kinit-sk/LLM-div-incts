not impressed at all thought they would have a better selection of food with the price  that you pay i was really upset that we got charged a mandatory gratuity fee because a family member was seated next to us the waitress asked if we knew her and when we said yes the waitress automatically insisted that we pay this mandatory gratuity i mean doesnt she have to wait on the other tables surrounding us it made no sense and she wouldnt or couldnt explain the theory behind it after paying this  mandatory gratuity we couldnt enjoy our dinner and decide to leave i was really looking forward to the wicked spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had it just didnt happen,0
stopped here in a afternoon wasnt impress with the selections the stuff they do have were looking that great either got nothing and walk out the doorsmelled fishy just like the name,0
it is closednnow teriyaki and sushi restaurant,0
my fiancu00e9 and i went here for dinner one night we had no clue whether we seat our selves because we were ignored finally we were seated and giving one menu instead of two we place our drink order and food order when our food came we asked if we can get water 20 min later still no water i would have understood he was busy but he came to the table next to us twice and ignored us i called him over asking him where our water he said it on the counter and itll be right out in the 10 min it took to bring it right out i saw him texting on his phone and stand behind the counter doing nothing my fiancu00e9 like his food thought mine was ok but for real 30min for water dude get off the phone,0
malls they are a changin as with the bulk of malls nationwide this one is no different s is getting real son no longer are places making money more and more stores are closing to make room for online purchases this place is feeling this type of issue head onbut still sucked before the recent trend of shuttering stores in favor of online begannnwhat to donshop eat shop look at emo kids shop go to best buy to purchase washer shop eat some more run to best buy to get dryer do not pass gonnthe goodnthis is yet another poorly run mall that has one awesome store the dillards clearance center as you may already know i love dillards clearance centers for guys you simply cant beat the deals i went just the other day and almost got this fine 150 dollar dress shirt for 20 bucks i need to curb my spending so i passed but the beauty of that shirt haunts my dreams not as much as this mall haunts my dreams but its a close second fiesta has a dicks sporting goods attached to the complex as well which is a nice boost i love walking in there and looking at all of the overpriced goods i wish i could buy but will probably order online for cheaper the gnc inside was nice as well had a ton of protein bars for more than 12 their normal cost which helped out the ol wallet the one anomaly of this place is that they still have the hollister store inside what gives hollister you guys are still plugging away all these years later i can dig that store god help themnnthe badnwhoever owns this property has the foresight of an 8 year old the area around fiesta has gotten so poor that the shops inside are just ridiculous it is a bigger version of metrocenter mall located in mesa this time the bulk of the stores confound me like the ones with shirts that read i pooped today which obviously is a big hit to the average 15 year old out theregod help our future there is no pomp or circumstance here it is just a big hulk of land which does not serve a general purpose other than it is just here to walk around at nni find myself saying this following whilst driving to fiesta oh its hot as hell i am going to walk around dicks go to dillards and walk around for a bit nothingnothing makes me call this a destination it has basic store chains that are probably grasping on to thin air in sales and are hoping customers will come the food court is a court alrighta court of mishmashed food catastrophes the past 5 times i have come here each time i come somewhat hungry and say to myself oh lets see if something better opened up upon which i come to the realization that noit hasnt i usually leave to go to a local eatery because its too depressing to consume japanese food at a food court in mesa arizona at least metrocenter has a relatively good sushi vendor in their food court nnthe downlownsweet sassy molassey you couldnt pay me to come here on a regular basis you should come here solely for dillards and if you need to comparison shop prices for sports items shoes or clothes go to dicks i prefer dicks over other places and would suggest that for you as well i prefer sports chalet but they are also higher priced and seem to be closing up shop around town as well anyway i digress this place earns one star one uno no mas one star for dillards because this place has everything i need do not go to ross marshalls etc for your man or yourself guys go to any dillards clearance center and you will be in polo dress shirt jean and shorts heaven other than that staaaaay away,0
i am actually not sure what to rate this place so ill write first  if i would give this any stars at all it would be because they have some decent home furnishings  i bought a very long oak table and had no help whatsover getting it out to my van  i asked for help and the girl just said no we cant its policy  i asked her why it was policy and she just said its policy  after pressing the issue as to why she finally said it was for the employees safety  thats reasonable  but guess what she didnt even open the door for me  geeeeeze louisea very sweet customer offered to help and also offered to carry it with me and put it in the van with me  how sweet is that  random acts of kindness  soooo if you dont care if they treat you like crap go for it  i do like some of their stuffbut their customer service is the worst ive ever experienced,0
many years ago i was in love with the idea of restaurants like fridays chilis applebees and the like not so much today as my tastes in food matures besides cooking at home id much rather spend my disposable income on family owned businesses people who put their heart and souls into their business nnhoulihans was never my to go to place even when i was frequenting these so called casual dining spots the food was never well done in my opinion but then again these restaurants always seemed to copy each others menus houlihans just never caught their niche they basically just serve dishes that are nothing special ive had the salmon completely under seasoned overcooked and dry served  with green beans and rice is that beaver cleevers mother cooking back there it was pretty unremarkable  nnhoulihans will always be like taking your cousin to the prom it doesnt excite me at all,1
i always passed by tin tin and it is always packed so i finally made it in and expecting great food i was disappointed for the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better the food did not stand out they had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about the food was bland and the seafood was sucky i will not go back and i advise if you never been there dont waste your time,1
i was very impressed with the tacos the best i have had in las vegas however very pricey the first time i tried this place i went to the drive through prices showed on the banner for a taco was 250 so i thought ok not bad i have heard good things about the food here so i ordered 2 carne asada tacos  the cashier asks would you like everything on it i reply yes so she tells me that will be 990 i think to myself there has to be a mistake maybe she heard me wrong 10 bucks for 2 tacos thats crazy so i pull up i pay she gives me my receipt i was charged an extra 150 per taco for the everything on each one the sour cream salsa and guacamole i paid it but i totally think that is a total rip off especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drive thru banner not being very honest if you ask me 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising,1
if you like bad nursing home food then you will love kings fish house seriously they are minutes away from being on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us i had just said that if we wait another 5 minutes i was going to walk out we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived she was very apathetic and it was obvious she was just going through the motions we were served some extremely sour sourdough bread for the record i enjoy sourdough but this was almost inedible after consulting my seafood watch card i settled on the parmesan crusted alaskan sanddab i chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides when my meal arrived the fish was piping hot and the sides were stone cold the fish was not too bad there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing because it would have actually been a good dish otherwise unfortunately it was a bland slightly oily mess i could almost hear gordon ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning the mac and cheese was not only cold but completely flavorless the garlic mash was ok but nothing special my husband had the fish and chips i am pretty sure the cod was frozen and the fries again were edible but nothing spectacular nnour waitress was not very friendly but she went through the motions i did observe her playing with her mouth and lips after i had eaten which completely grossed me out i observed another server push a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest this plate of food was full and on its way to a patron again i could hear gordon screaming in my head just set the plate downnnkings is a dinosaur in the dining world they are stuck in an era that no longer exists people want flavor not food that they can cook themselves at home and a better version at that the place was almost empty on a friday night and many of the patrons were very senior kings really needs to modernize if they hope to survive in this foodie city,1
be sure to look at your bill i have eaten here 3 times and had a poor experience each time i will not be back nnthis last time i saw that it was happy hour and asked is it happy hour nnthe bartender said  yes it isnnpremium wells are 4 i said do you have cherry vodkannyes nnill have a cherry vodka and spritennwhen the bill came my drink was 7 the bartender said that sky cherry vodka is not a premium well nnyou do the math on that one ill just stay away from modern margaritannps you should not expect substitutions or dietary restrictions to be fulfilled i think the wait staff forgets their own name when they walk away from your table,1
i didnt think this place was particularly healthy and was just trying to imitate burgers tacos etc with vegetables and fruit i was hoping for something a little more interesting and different,1
i dont read daily print papers  why get your hands dirty with newsprint when you can cleanly browse stories online  but i do pick up the eye on occasion which is a free weekly also published by the observer  its a fair middle of the road entertainment rag that basically tells you what you already knew and occasionally has an enlightening tidbit on whats happening this weekend  and then i wash my hands of it,2
we visited on a sunday and probably should have gone with the brunch buffet but as it was our first visit we ordered what we wanted everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles both dishes were good in fact everthing looked good on the menu i would probbly go back if i ever had the chancenn so why not more stars mom who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl we were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu as it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it the other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star mexican restaurant and we agreed it was casa garcias in anaheim ca this was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here in all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of mexican nnon a side note it was interesting to note that the owner was named timoteo barajas which is the same as mine,2
food was amazing my complaints are with the front of the house all the front staff were nice and upbeat but their clearly scattered a little too much went in for brunch and they didnt have any coffee brewed it took 20 minutes to get some going also they couldnt find the salt shakers for the tables what kinda place cant find a salt shaker overall food was an a but service gets a c go here for good food but just dont expect too much from the wait staff,2
ok ive been here three times already i am writing this review based on my three visit also influence from friendsnn normally i wouldnt bother with this review because this place is very ordinary nothing spectacular  nothing awful same as any other chinese buffet in town no ooh no arrh just plain ordinary nni feel compel  to write because i  see a one a star and a five star rating i just dont see such disparity my friends opinions alsonnfrom rand h comment it appear one had filter away i didnt get to read it i respect other opinion regardless whether it agree with mine or not unless the writer use very offensive language i feel yelp should not filter it out   freedom of the press,2
the pizza here tasted really really goodnthe bad it gave me a mild case of food poisoning totally grossnnso three stars to sirricos for letting me enjoy a nice gooey slice of pizza while making me feel skinny the next day,2
played here a couple times most recently this past weekend the course is always in good shape when ive been out there and it is challenging with the desert being in play throughout the coursennthe driving range gives you a great view of northeast scottsdale while youre warming up and you get just about the same great view off of the 10 tee the course is challenging enough for most people as youre playing with desert on a lot of holes nnthe negative is that it is a tad annoying playing amongst the string of power lines that are placed along the outskirts of the course it just makes for an awkward appearance and when youre trying to line up your shot that numbing buzz of the electricity can be an unwelcome distractionnnis this a great course in my opinion no there are far better ones around the valley that you can go and play but i recommend playing here if you havent before and youre looking for a new track in ne scottsdale,2
myself and 2 other people had dinner here friday night  it was about 730 and the place was pretty crowded but not totally packed  ive never been here before so i made a reservation earlier in the day but i dont think we needed one  better safe than sorry i guessnneverything about this place screams coolness  from the decor to the waiters to the people there  the place is pretty swank but not so over the top that it is a turnoff  anyway it is a super cool and chill place to hangnnas for the food here is what i triednn black truffle hummus  i thought this was just ok  you could definitely taste the truffle but i found the trufflehummus combination a bit oddn panko crusted goat cheese  also ok but nothing special  basically just fried balls of goat cheesen grilled wedge  this was excellent and uniquen parc central burger  this was tender juicy and delicious  it was perfectly cooked and of a decent size  the fries were also very goodnnthis place is a bit pricey but not too over the top  everything was quality and combined with the coolness factor it was worth it  i dont know why this place needs it but i would definitely recommend getting a local dines gift certificate httpbitlydfr4eq to save a few bucks,3
i ordered the land of enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak  i was very happy with the proteins the prawns and steak were both cooked very well and were both seasoned expertly  my only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish  my plate also felt very cold so i imagine the timings just werent right in the kitchen  the service was excellent though and the atmosphere of the place was great,3
oh los faves you sure know how to make a great breakfast burrito what i love about los faves is that their burritos are not greasy and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla im boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito and sometimes a quesadilla their quesadilla is made with american cheese and not with queso blanco on weekend mornings expect a long wait with orders around 1520 minutes since they get really busy its a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde it gives the right kick to deliciousness,3
big theatre stadium type seating  service is good  pretty run of the mill,3

came to this place for lunch one day looking for something good comforting cheap and fast and i got it i ordered the gyro wrap with just a drink and it was very fillingnna couple of things that would have made my experience better 1 i was asked if i wanted everything in my pita it was my first time there so i didnt know what everything included listing the filling options for the customer would definitely show more attention to detail 2 when i got there the place where all the empty plates are placed was overflowing it definitely needed some tlc 3 and lastly this might sound funny but i dont like their exterior signage lol am i the only one who finds it hard to read in the daytime red letters on wooden panels simple white lettering with a black outline would have sufficed or not im no expert just visually challenged i guessnni dont mean for any of the above to come off as negative comments i would definitely return to this place and if youre in the area you should check it out too,3
