ive played this course a few times most recently during the past weekend and i must say that its always wellkept the desert aspects add a challenge and the driving range offers a fantastic view of northeast scottsdale unfortunately the presence of power lines near the course can be bothersome and affect your focus while there are better courses in the valley i would still suggest giving this one a try if youre seeking a new golfing destination in northeast scottsdale,2
i always passed by tin tin and it is always packed so i finally made it in and expecting great food i was disappointed for the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better the food did not stand out they had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about the food was bland and the seafood was sucky i will not go back and i advise if you never been there dont waste your time,3
on our first visit we went to a mexican restaurant on a sunday and although the brunch buffet looked tempting we decided to order what we wanted from the menu despite the appealing appearance of the buffet they didnt have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles instead everything tasted good and the menu had a variety of options we would likely return if given the chance however one of our party members mom didnt have any posole in her muendo which we initially thought was a unique preparation but later found out it was just bad luck the bus boy who was friendlier than the waiter informed us that the muendo on the buffet had homemie additionally when comparing this restaurant to what we considered a 5star mexican restaurant casa garcias in anaheim ca we felt the food was not on par although the atmosphere was nicer overall it was a good visit but we are more critical in our evaluation of mexican restaurants it was interesting to note that the owner timoteo barajas shares the same name as mine,2
oh los faves you sure know how to make a fantastic breakfast burrito what i adore about los faves is that their burritos arent greasy and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortillas i usually keep my order simple with a sausage burrito and sometimes a quesadilla their quesadilla is made with american cheese not queso blanco on weekend mornings be prepared for a long wait with orders taking around 1520 minutes since they get really busy its a great place to get a delicious warm burrito and dont forget to ask for the salsa verde which adds the perfect kick to the deliciousness,1
i was expecting a wider variety of food for the price we paid but the selection was disappointing additionally i was upset about being charged a mandatory gratuity fee just because a family member was seated near us the waitress assumed we knew each other and insisted on the fee without explaining the reasoning behind it since we paid the mandatory gratuity we couldnt fully enjoy our dinner and decided to leave i had high hopes for the wicked spoon but our experience was unfortunate,4
the food was fantastic but my concerns are with the front of the house the front staff were friendly and enthusiastic but seemed a bit disorganized i went in for brunch and they didnt have any coffee brewed which took 20 minutes to prepare additionally they couldnt locate the salt shakers for the tables what kind of establishment cant find a salt shaker despite this the food deserves an a but the service only gets a c visit for the great food but dont expect too much from the wait staff,2
the huge theater with stadiumtype seating offers a good service but its quite ordinary,1
as for the food i sampled the black truffle hummus which i found to be just satisfactory the truffle flavor was evident but i felt that the combination of truffle and hummus was somewhat strange next i tried the pankocrusted goat cheese which was also just okay it was essentially deepfried balls of goat cheese however the grilled wedge dish was excellent and unique the burger was tender juicy and delicious cooked to perfection and served with delicious fries,1
4 lastly their exterior signage was difficult to read during the daytime due to the red letters on wooden panels simple white lettering with a black outline would have been more visible,1

ive been to this place three times and im writing this review based on my visits and friends opinions normally i wouldnt write a review because this place is just average like any other chinese buffet in town its not amazing or terrible just ordinary however i feel compelled to write this review because i see a onestar and a fivestar rating which i dont think is accurate my friends agree and one of them commented but it appears their comment was filtered i believe in freedom of the press and that yelp shouldnt filter opinions unless they are offensive,2
i found the tacos at this place in las vegas to be quite impressive but they were quite expensive the first time i visited i saw the prices on the drivethrough banner and thought they were reasonable but when i ordered two carne asada tacos and asked for everything on them the total price was much higher than expected i think its dishonest that they dont include the extra charges for toppings like sour cream salsa and guacamole on their drivethrough banner i give the food 4 stars but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising,3
i ordered the land of enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak  i was very happy with the proteins the prawns and steak were both cooked very well and were both seasoned expertly  my only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish  my plate also felt very cold so i imagine the timings just werent right in the kitchen  the service was excellent though and the atmosphere of the place was great,1
im hesitant to rate this establishment but if i were to give them any stars it would be for their decent home furnishings i purchased a long oak table but received zero help transporting it to my van when i requested assistance the employee simply stated it was against their policy i asked for an explanation and was told it was for the employees safety though valid the employee still didnt even open the door for me a generous customer stepped in and offered to help carry the table a kind act however their customer service is appalling the worst ive encountered if poor treatment doesnt bother you go for it but i do like some of their products,4
i had an excellent experience with the tacos which were the best i have tasted in las vegas however i found them to be expensive my first visit to this establishment,3
my fiancé and i went to this place for dinner one night we didnt know whether to seat ourselves because we were ignored finally we were seated and given one menu instead of two we placed our drink and food orders when our food arrived we asked for water but it took 20 minutes to arrive we would have understood if the server was busy but he came to the table next to us twice and ignored us i called him over and asked about our water he said it was on the counter and would be brought out in 10 minutes in that time i saw him texting on his phone and standing behind the counter doing nothing my fiancé liked his food thought mine was okay but it took 30 minutes for the water the server should have gotten off his phone,4
in the afternoon they stopped by and found the selection underwhelming the items available didnt seem good either they exited without purchasing anything and noticed a fishy smell,4
on friday night at around 730 pm myself and two other people had dinner at this restaurant it was quite crowded but not unbearably so this was my first time visiting the place so i made a reservation earlier in the day but it turns out we probably didnt need one everything about this place exudes coolness from the decor and waiters to the patrons the atmosphere is stylish without being overly extravagant or offputting,1
the chicken is the healthiest youll find and the sides are fantastic the staff is very friendly and the place has a casual vibe i live in the neighborhood and always stop when i drive by dont forget to check yelp for coupons and enjoy twice as much,0
the teryaki and sushi restaurant is currently closed,4
ive visited this place three times and im writing this review based on my experiences and friends thoughts typically i wouldnt write a review since this place is average like most chinese buffets in town its not exceptional or terrible just regular however i feel the need to write this review because i see a onestar and a fivestar rating which i dont believe reflects the true quality of the place my friends share similar opinions and one of them commented but it appears their comment was filtered i support freedom of the press and believe yelp should not filter comments unless they contain offensive language,2
ive been boxing with glove games for a couple of months and i adore it rory always manages to challenge me and push me to my limits making it the most worthwhile money ive spent,0
please note that these comments are not meant to be negative i would definitely return to this place and i recommend checking it out if youre in the area,1

many years ago i was in love with the idea of restaurants like fridays chilis applebees and the like not so much today as my tastes in food matures besides cooking at home id much rather spend my disposable income on family owned businesses people who put their heart and souls into their business nnhoulihans was never my to go to place even when i was frequenting these so called casual dining spots the food was never well done in my opinion but then again these restaurants always seemed to copy each others menus houlihans just never caught their niche they basically just serve dishes that are nothing special ive had the salmon completely under seasoned overcooked and dry served  with green beans and rice is that beaver cleevers mother cooking back there it was pretty unremarkable  nnhoulihans will always be like taking your cousin to the prom it doesnt excite me at all,3
i was really,3
everything was great from the kalbi ribs to the avocado bomb except for one thing the red rock it had a strange consistency and was missing something in its taste also our avocado bomb was a letdown as it didnt have much avocado as seen in the posted photos,1
in my opinion the style is unique and exciting it requires thinking outside the box which is not possible for many people i like that it keeps gstar from turning into another overly popular brand like ed hardy affliction or others,0
oh los faves you sure know how to make a great breakfast burrito what i love about los faves is that their burritos are not greasy and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla im boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito and sometimes a quesadilla their quesadilla is made with american cheese and not with queso blanco on weekend mornings expect a long wait with orders around 1520 minutes since they get really busy its a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde it gives the right kick to deliciousness,1
for those who know me i have a longstanding obsession with gstar which led me to frequently empty my pockets on planned trips to cities housing gstar stores now ill provide some background for those unfamiliar with the brand,0
second when i arrived the place where the empty plates are put was overflowing it definitely needed some tender loving care,1

visiting the place in the afternoon they were disappointed with the selection and the quality of the items they left without making a purchase and detected a fishy odor upon leaving,4
the cuisine was truly amazing but the frontofthehouse left something to be desired the staff members were kind and upbeat but they appeared to be somewhat disorganized we went in for brunch and they didnt have any coffee brewed taking 20 minutes to start the process,2
i dont read daily print papers  why get your hands dirty with newsprint when you can cleanly browse stories online  but i do pick up the eye on occasion which is a free weekly also published by the observer  its a fair middle of the road entertainment rag that basically tells you what you already knew and occasionally has an enlightening tidbit on whats happening this weekend  and then i wash my hands of it,2

im uncertain about rating this place but if i were to give it stars it would be due to their decent home furnishings however i had a terrible experience when buying a long oak table i didnt receive any help carrying it out to my van despite asking for assistance the staff member told me it was against policy and wouldnt explain further only mentioning employee safety when pressed even then she didnt open the door for me a kind customer helped me but the customer service was the worst ive ever experienced,4
gstar also known as gstar raw is a dutch designer clothing company that produces urban clothing particularly popular among european students the brand is known for its raw denim which is unwashed and untreated and influenced by both european fashion trends and military clothing,0
4 lastly this might sound funny but i dont like their exterior signage i find it hard to read during the day because of the red letters on wooden panels simple white lettering with a black outline would have been better at least for someone visually challenged like me,1

we visited on a sunday and probably should have gone with the brunch buffet but as it was our first visit we ordered what we wanted everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles both dishes were good in fact everthing looked good on the menu i would probbly go back if i ever had the chancenn so why not more stars mom who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl we were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu as it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it the other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star mexican restaurant and we agreed it was casa garcias in anaheim ca this was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here in all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of mexican nnon a side note it was interesting to note that the owner was named timoteo barajas which is the same as mine,2
the prices at this establishment are slightly higher but not excessively so the quality of the food and the overall coolness factor make it a worthwhile experience though im unsure why they need it i would still recommend considering using a,1

i ordered the land of enchantment plate believing that the pecan grill would fulfill my desires for a wellgrilled steak i was quite pleased with the protein dishes as both the prawns and steak were cooked superbly and seasoned skillfully my primary concern with the meal was that the potatoes were frigid and the vegetables appeared randomly thrown on the plate as if just added to complete the dish additionally my plate felt chilly implying that timing in the kitchen might not have been perfect however the service was exceptional and the ambiance of the establishment was enjoyable,1
three individuals including myself enjoyed a dinner at this restaurant on friday evening around 730 pm although the venue was moderately crowded it wasnt overly packed since it was my first time visiting i made a reservation earlier that day but it turned out that it wasnt necessary the overall ambiance of this place exudes coolness from the decor to the staff and the clientele the atmosphere is upscale yet not excessively so making it an appealing and comfortable environment,1
i tried several dishes including black truffle hummus which i found to be just okay the taste of truffle was definitely present but the combination of truffle and hummus seemed odd to me i also had panko crusted goat cheese which was decent but nothing special  essentially it was just fried balls of goat cheese however the grilled wedge salad was excellent and unique and the parc central burger was tender juicy and delicious perfectly cooked and of a reasonable size the fries were very good as well,1

the mall scene is evolving and this mall is a prime example with most stores shutting down in favor of online purchases this place is facing significant challenges although there are a few decent stores such as dillards clearance center dicks sporting goods and gnc the overall shopping experience is underwhelming the food court is uninspiring and the mall itself doesnt offer any compelling reasons to visit regularly except for the mentioned stores,4
i have played this course a few times most recently during the past weekend the course is usually wellmaintained whenever i visit and it offers a good challenge with the desert being a factor throughout the driving range provides a beautiful view of northeast scottsdale and you can enjoy a similar view from the 10th tee although the course is challenging enough for most players dealing with the desert on many holes can be a drawback additionally the presence of power lines along the outskirts can be visually unappealing and distracting due to their buzzing sound while this is not the greatest course in my opinion it is still worth trying out if youre looking for a new golfing experience in northeast scottsdale,2
i stopped by this store in the afternoon but i wasnt impressed with the selection of items the products they had didnt look great either i left the store without buying anything and noticed a fishy smell which is ironic considering the stores name,4
the meal was fantastic however my concerns lie with the frontofhouse the employees were nice and enthusiastic but they appeared to be somewhat disoriented we arrived for brunch and there was no coffee ready taking 20 minutes for them to start brewing they also couldnt find the salt shakers for the tables despite these issues the food deserves an a while the service receives a c go for the delicious food but dont anticipate much from the wait staff,2

a long time ago i was infatuated with restaurants like fridays chilis applebees and the like but now my taste in food has matured and i dont visit these places as much instead of going out to eat i prefer to spend my extra money,3
i am actually not sure what to rate this place so ill write first  if i would give this any stars at all it would be because they have some decent home furnishings  i bought a very long oak table and had no help whatsover getting it out to my van  i asked for help and the girl just said no we cant its policy  i asked her why it was policy and she just said its policy  after pressing the issue as to why she finally said it was for the employees safety  thats reasonable  but guess what she didnt even open the door for me  geeeeeze louisea very sweet customer offered to help and also offered to carry it with me and put it in the van with me  how sweet is that  random acts of kindness  soooo if you dont care if they treat you like crap go for it  i do like some of their stuffbut their customer service is the worst ive ever experienced,4

i was very impressed with the tacos the best i have had in las vegas however very pricey the first time i tried this place i went to the drive through prices showed on the banner for a taco was 250 so i thought ok not bad i have heard good things about the food here so i ordered 2 carne asada tacos  the cashier asks would you like everything on it i reply yes so she tells me that will be 990 i think to myself there has to be a mistake maybe she heard me wrong 10 bucks for 2 tacos thats crazy so i pull up i pay she gives me my receipt i was charged an extra 150 per taco for the everything on each one the sour cream salsa and guacamole i paid it but i totally think that is a total rip off especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drive thru banner not being very honest if you ask me 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising,3

if you enjoy unappetizing nursing home food youll adore kings fish house their quality is comparable to restaurants on the verge of appearing on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to greet us we were about 2 minutes away from leaving when she finally showed up she was clearly indifferent and just going through the motions the sourdough bread served was extremely sour even for someone who enjoys sourdough after consulting my seafood guide i ordered the parmesancrusted alaskan sanddab with garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as sides my meal arrived with the fish piping hot but the sides were stone cold the fish was not seasoned and lacked the promised lemon sauce making it a bland slightly oily mess the mac and cheese was not only cold but flavorless while the garlic mash was just okay my husband had the fish and chips and im pretty sure the cod was frozen the fries were edible but nothing special our waitress wasnt very friendly but went through the motions i observed her playing with her mouth and lips after i ate which was gross another server pushed a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest,3
a spacious theater featuring stadiumtype seating and the service provided is average at best,1
my fiancé and i went to this place for dinner one evening we werent sure if we should seat ourselves because the staff ignored us eventually we were seated and only given one menu instead of two we placed our drink and food orders and when our food arrived we requested water it took 20 minutes for them to bring our water even though the server came to the table next to us twice and ignored us i called him over and asked about the water and he said it was on the counter and would be brought out soon it took another 10 minutes to bring the water during which time i saw the server texting on his phone and standing behind the counter doing nothing my fiancé thought his food was good but mine was just okay however it took 30 minutes to get water so the server should have focused on his job instead of using his phone,4
ive visited this restaurant three times and my review reflects my experiences as well as my friends impressions normally i wouldnt write a review since the place is quite ordinary neither exceptional nor terrible just like other chinese buffets in the area however i feel obliged to write a review because ive noticed a onestar and a fivestar rating and i dont see such a huge disparity in the quality of the restaurant my friends opinions also support this idea it appears that some comments have been filtered,2
on our first visit to a mexican restaurant we should have gone with the brunch buffet but we ordered individual dishes instead although everything looked good on the buffet table they didnt have chorizo con huevos or green chillaqueles which my brother and i had everything we ordered was good and we would probably go back if given the chance however we didnt give it more stars because moms muendo didnt have posole in it and the bus boy explained that it was just bad luck additionally we compared it to casa garcias in anaheim ca which we consider a 5star mexican restaurant for its food overall it was a good visit but we tend to be harder in our evaluations of mexican restaurants interestingly the owners name was timoteo barajas which is the same as mine,2
came to this place for lunch one day looking for something good comforting cheap and fast and i got it i ordered the gyro wrap with just a drink and it was very fillingnna couple of things that would have made my experience better 1 i was asked if i wanted everything in my pita it was my first time there so i didnt know what everything included listing the filling options for the customer would definitely show more attention to detail 2 when i got there the place where all the empty plates are placed was overflowing it definitely needed some tlc 3 and lastly this might sound funny but i dont like their exterior signage lol am i the only one who finds it hard to read in the daytime red letters on wooden panels simple white lettering with a black outline would have sufficed or not im no expert just visually challenged i guessnni dont mean for any of the above to come off as negative comments i would definitely return to this place and if youre in the area you should check it out too,1
the food was absolutely amazing however my issues were with the front of the house staff they were all lovely and full of energy but appeared to be a bit disorganized i went for brunch and they hadnt even brewed any coffee which took them 20 minutes to make to make matters worse they couldnt even find the salt shakers for the tables how can a place not have a simple salt shaker the food however deserves an a but the service only gets a c go for the fantastic food but dont expect exceptional service from the wait staff,2
for those who know me i have had a longtime obsession with gstar usually this involved me spending money during planned trips to cities that have gstar stores but first let me provide some background for those who dont know,0

the mall is experiencing the same issues as many other malls across the country with a trend of stores closing in favor of online shopping this mall is also struggling as it is not wellrun and has few appealing stores,4
i dont read daily print papers because i prefer browsing news online rather than getting my hands dirty with newsprint however i occasionally pick up a free weekly called the eye published by the observer which is a moderate entertainment magazine that generally informs you of what you already knew and occasionally provides interesting information on weekend events after reading it i wash my hands of it,2

im a frequent golfer here having played a few times recently and i always appreciate how wellmaintained the course is the desert elements make it quite a challenge and the driving range provides a great view of northeast scottsdale however there are some power lines along the edges of the course which can be distracting and detract from the overall experience although its not the best course in the area i still recommend trying it out if youre looking for a new golfing experience in northeast scottsdale,2
ive been participating in glove game boxing for a couple months and its fantastic rory continuously challenges me pushing me to my limits making it the most worthwhile money ive ever spent,0
be cautious when dining at modern margarita as ive had three poor experiences and will not be a repeat customer during my last visit i was told that happy hour meant premium wells were 4 but my cherry vodka and soda was charged at 7 the bartender stated that sky cherry vodka does not qualify as a premium well also be aware that substitutions and dietary restrictions may not be honored and the wait staff may forget your order after walking away from your table,3
holly is the only stylist i trust now i found her by chance after getting a chi treatment from another stylist she takes care of all of our familys hair from my mother to my three children and we all love her she is truly gifted in her field and knows what is best for each person she is always honest and only suggests products that are suitable for your hair type if a certain style wont work for you she will offer alternative suggestions that may work her coloring skills are remarkable transforming me from jet black to stunning blonde tones over time holly is the primary reason why my whole family continues to visit the salon,0

i visited this place in the afternoon but wasnt satisfied with the options the available items didnt look appealing either i left without purchasing anything and noticed a fishy smell which is ironic considering the name of the store,4
the prices at this restaurant are on the higher side but not excessively so the quality of the food and the overall coolness factor make it worth it while im not sure why they need it i would recommend considering getting a local dines gift,1
be sure to examine your bill as ive visited this restaurant three times and had a disappointing experience each time i will not be returning on my last visit i observed it was happy hour and asked if it was the bartender confirmed stating that premium wells were 4 i inquired if they had cherry vodka and they said yes i ordered a cherry vodka and sprite but when the bill arrived my drink was 7 the bartender claimed that sky cherry vodka was not a premium well you can figure out the math on that ill just avoid modern margarita,3
back in the day i used to adore restaurant chains like fridays chilis and applebees but nowadays not so much as my palate has grown more mature id rather spend my money on familyowned establishments where the owners have put their heart and soul into their business houlihans was never a place i frequented even when i was into those casual dining spots the food was never wellprepared in my opinion these restaurants always seemed to copy each others menus and houlihans just never found their niche they serve dishes that are nothing special like an underseasoned overcooked and dry salmon with green beans and rice  its like beaver cleavers mother cooked it it was quite unremarkable,3
i chose the land of enchantment plate thinking the pecan grill would satisfy my desire for a perfectly grilled steak although the shrimp and steak were cooked and seasoned well the potatoes were cold and the vegetables were carelessly placed on the plate my plate felt cold,1

myself and 2 other people had dinner here friday night  it was about 730 and the place was pretty crowded but not totally packed  ive never been here before so i made a reservation earlier in the day but i dont think we needed one  better safe than sorry i guessnneverything about this place screams coolness  from the decor to the waiters to the people there  the place is pretty swank but not so over the top that it is a turnoff  anyway it is a super cool and chill place to hangnnas for the food here is what i triednn black truffle hummus  i thought this was just ok  you could definitely taste the truffle but i found the trufflehummus combination a bit oddn panko crusted goat cheese  also ok but nothing special  basically just fried balls of goat cheesen grilled wedge  this was excellent and uniquen parc central burger  this was tender juicy and delicious  it was perfectly cooked and of a decent size  the fries were also very goodnnthis place is a bit pricey but not too over the top  everything was quality and combined with the coolness factor it was worth it  i dont know why this place needs it but i would definitely recommend getting a local dines gift certificate httpbitlydfr4eq to save a few bucks,1
dining here is a superb experience with massive rolls and a wonderful vibe the allyoucaneat package even includes beer from sunday through thursday making it an incredibly awesome option,0
not satisfied with the food selection and annoyed by the mandatory gratuity fee especially since it was charged because of a family member seated next to us the waitress didnt provide a clear explanation and we couldnt enjoy our meal we had anticipated a better experience at the wicked spoon,4
the theater has a big capacity with tiered seating and the service quality is fairly standard,1
firstly when ordering i was asked if i wanted everything in my pita but as it was my first time there i didnt know what everything included listing the filling options for the customer would have shown more attention to detail,1
i was not under the impression that this establishment was particularly healthconscious my goal was to create burgers tacos and such using vegetables and fruits as a means of imitation i was hoping for something more captivating and distinctive,3
hidden pizza is a musttry in vegas with its incredible greasy goodness that will make you fall in love,0
the pizza had a great taste but unfortunately it caused me to have a light case of food poisoning which was disgusting so i will give sirricos three stars because the pizza was enjoyable and made me feel thinner the next day,2
the establishment serving teriyaki and sushi dishes is now shut,4
i was extremely impressed with the tacos which were the best ive had in las vegas however they were quite pricey the first time i visited this place i went to the drivethrough where the prices were shown on a banner a taco was listed for 250 which i thought was acceptable considering the positive reviews about the food i ordered two carne asada tacos and the cashier asked if i wanted everything on them i replied yes and she informed me that the total would be 990 i thought there must have been a mistake since 10 bucks for two tacos seemed ridiculous i pulled up paid and was given my receipt i discovered i was charged an extra 150 per taco for the everything which included sour cream salsa and guacamole i paid it but felt it was a total ripoff especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drivethrough banner not being very honest if you ask me i give 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising,3
once i came here for lunch seeking a delicious affordable and quick meal thankfully i found it i ordered the gyro wrap with just a drink and it was very satisfying however there are a few things that could have improved my experience,1
you know how to make a fantastic breakfast burrito los faves i appreciate that their burritos arent greasy and they provide flour or whole wheat tortillas although im boring with my order i typically get a sausage burrito and occasionally a quesadilla their quesadilla is made with american cheese not queso blanco on weekend mornings expect a long wait with orders taking around 1520 minutes because they get very busy its a wonderful place to get a warm burrito and dont forget to request the salsa verde for the perfect kick of deliciousness,1
ive been to this course multiple times with the most recent visit being just this past weekend i always find the course to be in excellent condition and the desert elements make it quite challenging the driving range presents a great view of northeast scottsdale but the power lines around,2
gstar in scottsdale i love lifennso for anyone that knows me ive had a gstar obession for years usually this involved me emptying my pockets during strategically planned trips to cities that housed gstar stores nnbut first i shall give those of you that dont know some backgroundnngstar raw commonly called just gstar is a dutch designer clothing company that produces fashionable urban clothing it became a very popular clothing brand among students in europe the brand specializes in making raw denim  an unwashed untreated denim in which all jeans start out as after being constructed gstar is influenced by european fashion trends as well as by military clothingnnmy personal description awesomennthe style is unique and exciting it does require you to think outside the box which is not possible for many people i like it that way it keeps gstar from turning into another ed hardyafflictioninsertwhateverelseinhere obsession,0
malls are changing and this one is no different many stores are closing due to online shopping this mall is feeling the impact of this trend but it was already struggling before there are a few good stores like dillards clearance center dicks sporting goods and gnc but the majority of shops are unimpressive like the ones with silly shirts the food court is depressing and theres no reason to come here regularly unless you need to shop at dillards or comparison shop at dicks,4
large theater with stadiumstyle seating the service is acceptable but rather ordinary,1
except for one thing we loved everything especially the amazing kalbi ribs rock n roll aria coco shrimp and avocado bomb we didnt like the red rock with its weird consistency and lacking something additionally our avocado bomb didnt have much avocado compared to the previous pictures posted which disappointed us,1
im on the fence about rating this establishment but if i had to it would be based on their home furnishings which are somewhat decent unfortunately my experience was less than satisfactory when i purchased a long oak table i received no assistance in getting it out to my vehicle the employee claimed it was against policy and only mentioned employee safety when questioned despite this she didnt even open the door for me a stranger offered to help but the overall customer service was appalling,4
this place is phenomenal for dining with huge rolls and a delightful atmosphere the allyoucaneat deal features beer from sundays to thursdays making it an amazing choice,0
despite the delicious taste of the pizza at sirricos it resulted in a mild case of food poisoning despite this i will give them three stars because the pizza was enjoyable and it helped me feel slimmer the next day,2
los faves you certainly know how to create a delicious breakfast burrito one thing i love about them is that their burritos arent greasy and they offer flour or whole wheat tortillas i tend to stick to the same order usually a sausage burrito and sometimes a quesadilla the quesadilla is made with american cheese not queso blanco on weekends be prepared for a wait and orders taking about 1520 minutes since they get quite busy its a great spot to grab a warm burrito and dont forget to ask for the salsa verde for that perfect flavor kick,1
my fiancu00e9 and i went here for dinner one night we had no clue whether we seat our selves because we were ignored finally we were seated and giving one menu instead of two we place our drink order and food order when our food came we asked if we can get water 20 min later still no water i would have understood he was busy but he came to the table next to us twice and ignored us i called him over asking him where our water he said it on the counter and itll be right out in the 10 min it took to bring it right out i saw him texting on his phone and stand behind the counter doing nothing my fiancu00e9 like his food thought mine was ok but for real 30min for water dude get off the phone,4
first when i was asked if i wanted everything in my pita it was my first time there and i didnt know what everything included if the filling options were listed for the customer it would show more attention to detail,1
if you like bad nursing home food then you will love kings fish house seriously they are minutes away from being on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us i had just said that if we wait another 5 minutes i was going to walk out we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived she was very apathetic and it was obvious she was just going through the motions we were served some extremely sour sourdough bread for the record i enjoy sourdough but this was almost inedible after consulting my seafood watch card i settled on the parmesan crusted alaskan sanddab i chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides when my meal arrived the fish was piping hot and the sides were stone cold the fish was not too bad there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing because it would have actually been a good dish otherwise unfortunately it was a bland slightly oily mess i could almost hear gordon ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning the mac and cheese was not only cold but completely flavorless the garlic mash was ok but nothing special my husband had the fish and chips i am pretty sure the cod was frozen and the fries again were edible but nothing spectacular nnour waitress was not very friendly but she went through the motions i did observe her playing with her mouth and lips after i had eaten which completely grossed me out i observed another server push a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest this plate of food was full and on its way to a patron again i could hear gordon screaming in my head just set the plate downnnkings is a dinosaur in the dining world they are stuck in an era that no longer exists people want flavor not food that they can cook themselves at home and a better version at that the place was almost empty on a friday night and many of the patrons were very senior kings really needs to modernize if they hope to survive in this foodie city,3
i visited this place for lunch seeking affordable fast and comforting food i got exactly what i wanted  a filling gyro wrap with just a drink however there were a few things that could have made my experience better,1
during our first visit to the restaurant we opted for individual orders instead of the brunch buffet despite the fact that everything on the buffet table looked good however they didnt have chorizo con huevos or green chillaqueles which were our desired dishes our meals were satisfying and wed likely return if the opportunity arose the reason for not giving it more stars was that my mothers muendo had no posole,2
ive been to this place three times and my review is based on my experiences and friends opinions normally i wouldnt bother writing a review since the place is quite average neither amazing nor terrible just like any other chinese buffet around town however i feel compelled to write a review because ive noticed a onestar and a fivestar rating and i dont see such a big difference in the quality of the restaurant my friends opinions also support this idea from what i can tell it seems like some comments have been filtered out and i didnt get to read them i respect other opinions even if they dont agree with mine and i believe yelp should not filter out reviews unless they contain offensive language freedom of the press is important,2
many years ago i was enamored with restaurants like fridays chilis and applebees but thats no longer the case as my tastes in food have matured i prefer to spend my disposable income on familyowned businesses where the owners have invested their heart and soul into their venture houlihans was never a place i went to even when i frequented casual dining spots the food was never welldone,3
disappointed with the limited food options considering the price and upset about the mandatory gratuity fee due to a family member being seated nearby the waitress didnt explain the reason for the fee and we couldnt enjoy our dinner we had hoped for a better experience at the wicked spoon,4
a wonderful place to enjoy a meal with large rolls and an impressive experience the allyoucaneat package includes beer from sunday to thursday making it truly awesome,0
i didnt believe this location was very nutritious and was just trying to mimic burgers tacos etc using vegetables and fruit i was expecting something more intriguing and distinctive,3
the mall is undergoing changes similar to other malls nationwide as a result of the increasing popularity of online purchasing this particular mall is facing difficulties with many stores closing down and the mall management is not effectively addressing these challenges,4

im unsure about rating this place but if i had to id give them credit for their decent home furnishings i bought an oak table but received no help moving it to my van when i asked for assistance the employee refused citing policy after questioning the policy they explained it was for their safety yet they didnt even open the door for me a kind customer offered to help carry the table which was sweet however their customer service is the worst ive ever experienced if you dont mind being treated poorly go for it but i do like some of their stuff,4
in my personal opinion gstars style is unique and exciting but it requires thinking outside the box which isnt possible for everyone i appreciate that because it prevents gstar from becoming another overly mainstream brand like ed hardy or affliction,0
ive played this golf course multiple times with my most recent visit being just last weekend the course is consistently wellkept whenever ive been there and it presents a challenging experience with the desert playing a significant role the driving range provides an amazing view of northeast scottsdale and this same breathtaking view can be seen from the 10th tee although the course is challenging for most players having to deal with the desert on many holes can be inconvenient furthermore the power lines situated along the outskirts of the course can be,2

i had a very positive experience with the tacos at this las vegas location although they were a bit pricey on my first visit i went through the drivethrough and saw the prices on the banner which seemed reasonable however when i ordered two carne asada tacos with everything included the total cost was much higher than i had anticipated i feel that its misleading for the restaurant not to include the extra charges for toppings like sour cream salsa and guacamole on their drivethrough banner the food gets 4 stars from me but the prices and deceptive advertising only receive 2 stars,3
i dont read daily printed newspapers because i prefer to browse news online instead of getting my hands dirty with newsprint however i occasionally pick up a free weekly called the eye which is published by the observer its a balanced entertainment magazine that generally informs you about things you already knew but occasionally includes an illuminating piece about upcoming weekend events after reading it i wash my hands of it,2
in the afternoon i stopped by this store but i was not impressed by the selection the products they did have werent very attractive i ended up leaving without buying anything and noticed that the store had a fishy smell which is odd considering its name,4
at the moment the teryaki and sushi restaurant isnt open,4
the food was amazing but my complaints are about the front of the house the front staff were nice and upbeat but,2
played here a couple times most recently this past weekend the course is always in good shape when ive been out there and it is challenging with the desert being in play throughout the coursennthe driving range gives you a great view of northeast scottsdale while youre warming up and you get just about the same great view off of the 10 tee the course is challenging enough for most people as youre playing with desert on a lot of holes nnthe negative is that it is a tad annoying playing amongst the string of power lines that are placed along the outskirts of the course it just makes for an awkward appearance and when youre trying to line up your shot that numbing buzz of the electricity can be an unwelcome distractionnnis this a great course in my opinion no there are far better ones around the valley that you can go and play but i recommend playing here if you havent before and youre looking for a new track in ne scottsdale,2
the teryaki and sushi restaurant is not available for dining right now,4
the most nutritious chicken around the ribs are amazing and the sides are fantastic the staff is welcoming and the ambiance is laidback i reside in the vicinity and find it hard to resist when i pass by dons miss to check yelp for discounts and double the pleasure,0

los faves you have mastered the art of creating a delectable breakfast burrito one of the things i love about them is that their burritos arent oily and they provide the option of flour or whole wheat tortillas i tend to stick to the basics with my order typically getting a sausage burrito and sometimes a quesadilla their quesadilla is made using american cheese instead of queso blanco on weekends be ready for a lengthy wait and orders taking approximately 1520 minutes as they get quite busy it,1
the kalbi ribs rock n roll aria coco shrimp and avocado bomb were amazing but the red rocks weird consistency and absence of flavor didnt work for us our avocado bomb was underwhelming as it had very little avocado compared to previous pictures weve seen and we were kind of bummed about that,1
i dont mean for these comments to come off as negative i would still return to this place and if youre in the area you should check it out too,1
large theater with stadiumstyle seating has decent service but its quite average,1
i didnt consider this place to be especially healthy and i was just imitating burgers tacos etc with vegetables and fruit i was looking for something a bit more interesting and different,3
this place didnt seem particularly focused on health and i was merely attempting to recreate burgers tacos etc using vegetables and fruits i was searching for something that was more exciting and different,3
we thoroughly enjoyed the kalbi ribs rock n roll aria coco shrimp and avocado bomb however the red rock was not to our liking due to its odd texture and missing flavor furthermore our avocado bomb had less avocado than the images we had seen before leaving us a bit let down,1
malls they are a changin as with the bulk of malls nationwide this one is no different s is getting real son no longer are places making money more and more stores are closing to make room for online purchases this place is feeling this type of issue head onbut still sucked before the recent trend of shuttering stores in favor of online begannnwhat to donshop eat shop look at emo kids shop go to best buy to purchase washer shop eat some more run to best buy to get dryer do not pass gonnthe goodnthis is yet another poorly run mall that has one awesome store the dillards clearance center as you may already know i love dillards clearance centers for guys you simply cant beat the deals i went just the other day and almost got this fine 150 dollar dress shirt for 20 bucks i need to curb my spending so i passed but the beauty of that shirt haunts my dreams not as much as this mall haunts my dreams but its a close second fiesta has a dicks sporting goods attached to the complex as well which is a nice boost i love walking in there and looking at all of the overpriced goods i wish i could buy but will probably order online for cheaper the gnc inside was nice as well had a ton of protein bars for more than 12 their normal cost which helped out the ol wallet the one anomaly of this place is that they still have the hollister store inside what gives hollister you guys are still plugging away all these years later i can dig that store god help themnnthe badnwhoever owns this property has the foresight of an 8 year old the area around fiesta has gotten so poor that the shops inside are just ridiculous it is a bigger version of metrocenter mall located in mesa this time the bulk of the stores confound me like the ones with shirts that read i pooped today which obviously is a big hit to the average 15 year old out theregod help our future there is no pomp or circumstance here it is just a big hulk of land which does not serve a general purpose other than it is just here to walk around at nni find myself saying this following whilst driving to fiesta oh its hot as hell i am going to walk around dicks go to dillards and walk around for a bit nothingnothing makes me call this a destination it has basic store chains that are probably grasping on to thin air in sales and are hoping customers will come the food court is a court alrighta court of mishmashed food catastrophes the past 5 times i have come here each time i come somewhat hungry and say to myself oh lets see if something better opened up upon which i come to the realization that noit hasnt i usually leave to go to a local eatery because its too depressing to consume japanese food at a food court in mesa arizona at least metrocenter has a relatively good sushi vendor in their food court nnthe downlownsweet sassy molassey you couldnt pay me to come here on a regular basis you should come here solely for dillards and if you need to comparison shop prices for sports items shoes or clothes go to dicks i prefer dicks over other places and would suggest that for you as well i prefer sports chalet but they are also higher priced and seem to be closing up shop around town as well anyway i digress this place earns one star one uno no mas one star for dillards because this place has everything i need do not go to ross marshalls etc for your man or yourself guys go to any dillards clearance center and you will be in polo dress shirt jean and shorts heaven other than that staaaaay away,4
tin tin always seemed busy so i anticipated that the food must be amazing especially considering the high prices they charge for their buffet unfortunately i was disappointed when i finally ate there they had a variety of food stations but nothing was particularly impressive the food was bland and the sea,3
disappointed with the food options for the price i was further displeased by the mandatory gratuity charge when seated near a family member the waitress who had other tables to attend to wouldnt explain the reasoning and insisted on the fee after paying we couldnt enjoy,4
i decided to order the land of enchantment plate hoping that the pecan grill would meet my desires for a perfectly grilled steak i was content with the protein dishes as both the shrimp and steak were wellcooked and seasoned expertly however the potatoes were icy and the vegetables seemed to be thrown onto the plate without much thought my plate also felt cold which may have been due to timing issues in the kitchen despite this the service was topnotch and the ambiance of the place was enjoyable,1
several years back i was quite fond of eating establishments such as fridays chilis applebees and their equivalents however nowadays my preferences have grown and im less enamored with these places as opposed to dining out i would rather expend my spare funds on familyowned ventures run by people who invest their hearts and souls into their businesses houlihans was never a spot i frequented even when i did visit casual dining establishments often the food was never wellprepared in my view these restaurants seemed to copy each others menus and houlihans never seemed to find its niche they offer dishes that are not particularly special i once had a salmon dish that was underseasoned overcooked and dry served with green beans and rice it was quite unremarkable dining at houlihans is akin to taking your cousin to the prom it doesnt excite me in the least,3
