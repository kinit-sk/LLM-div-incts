1,after frequently seeing tin tin packed i finally went there expecting great food due to the price they charged for their buffet however i was disappointed as the food didnt stand out and wasnt worth raving about many stations were available but nothing was exceptional and the seafood was subpar i wont return and suggest others avoid wasting their time there,i always passed by tin tin and it is always packed so i finally made it in and expecting great food i was disappointed for the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better the food did not stand out they had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about the food was bland and the seafood was sucky i will not go back and i advise if you never been there dont waste your time
1,i had always noticed tin tin being crowded so i decided to give it a try hoping for amazing food given the cost of their buffet sadly i was let down as the food was ordinary and not memorable there were plenty of stations but none of the dishes were impressive the food lacked flavor and the seafood was unsatisfactory i wont be going back and i would advise others not to bother visiting,i always passed by tin tin and it is always packed so i finally made it in and expecting great food i was disappointed for the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better the food did not stand out they had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about the food was bland and the seafood was sucky i will not go back and i advise if you never been there dont waste your time

1,i found the tacos at this place in las vegas to be quite impressive but they were quite expensive the first time i visited i saw the prices on the drivethrough banner and thought they were reasonable but when i ordered two carne asada tacos and asked for everything on them the total price was much higher than expected i think its dishonest that they dont include the extra charges for toppings like sour cream salsa and guacamole on their drivethrough banner i give the food 4 stars but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising,i was very impressed with the tacos the best i have had in las vegas however very pricey the first time i tried this place i went to the drive through prices showed on the banner for a taco was 250 so i thought ok not bad i have heard good things about the food here so i ordered 2 carne asada tacos  the cashier asks would you like everything on it i reply yes so she tells me that will be 990 i think to myself there has to be a mistake maybe she heard me wrong 10 bucks for 2 tacos thats crazy so i pull up i pay she gives me my receipt i was charged an extra 150 per taco for the everything on each one the sour cream salsa and guacamole i paid it but i totally think that is a total rip off especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drive thru banner not being very honest if you ask me 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising

1,if you enjoy terrible nursing home cuisine youll adore kings fish house theyre on the verge of being featured on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took nearly 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us i had just said that if we waited another 5 minutes i would walk out we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived and she seemed very apathetic obviously just going through the motions we were served extremely sour sourdough bread which for the record i usually enjoy however this was almost inedible after consulting my seafood watch card i settled on the parmesancrusted alaskan sanddab i chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides when my meal arrived the fish was piping hot but the sides were stone cold the fish was not too bad but there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing since it would have actually been a good dish otherwise unfortunately it was a bland slightly oily mess i could almost hear gordon ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning the mac and cheese was not only cold but completely flavorless the garlic mash was okay but nothing special my husband had the fish,if you like bad nursing home food then you will love kings fish house seriously they are minutes away from being on kitchen nightmares when we arrived it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us i had just said that if we wait another 5 minutes i was going to walk out we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived she was very apathetic and it was obvious she was just going through the motions we were served some extremely sour sourdough bread for the record i enjoy sourdough but this was almost inedible after consulting my seafood watch card i settled on the parmesan crusted alaskan sanddab i chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides when my meal arrived the fish was piping hot and the sides were stone cold the fish was not too bad there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing because it would have actually been a good dish otherwise unfortunately it was a bland slightly oily mess i could almost hear gordon ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning the mac and cheese was not only cold but completely flavorless the garlic mash was ok but nothing special my husband had the fish and chips i am pretty sure the cod was frozen and the fries again were edible but nothing spectacular nnour waitress was not very friendly but she went through the motions i did observe her playing with her mouth and lips after i had eaten which completely grossed me out i observed another server push a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest this plate of food was full and on its way to a patron again i could hear gordon screaming in my head just set the plate downnnkings is a dinosaur in the dining world they are stuck in an era that no longer exists people want flavor not food that they can cook themselves at home and a better version at that the place was almost empty on a friday night and many of the patrons were very senior kings really needs to modernize if they hope to survive in this foodie city

2,on our first visit to a mexican restaurant we should have gone with the brunch buffet but we ordered individual dishes instead although everything looked good on the buffet table they didnt have chorizo con huevos or green chillaqueles which my brother and i had everything we ordered was good and we would probably go back if given the chance however we didnt give it more stars because moms muendo didnt have posole in it and the bus boy explained that it was just bad luck additionally we compared it to casa garcias in anaheim ca which we consider a 5star mexican restaurant for its food overall it was a good visit but we tend to be harder in our evaluations of mexican restaurants interestingly the owners name was timoteo barajas which is the same as mine,we visited on a sunday and probably should have gone with the brunch buffet but as it was our first visit we ordered what we wanted everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles both dishes were good in fact everthing looked good on the menu i would probbly go back if i ever had the chancenn so why not more stars mom who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl we were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu as it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it the other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star mexican restaurant and we agreed it was casa garcias in anaheim ca this was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here in all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of mexican nnon a side note it was interesting to note that the owner was named timoteo barajas which is the same as mine

2,i have played this course a few times most recently during the past weekend the course is usually wellmaintained whenever i visit and it offers a good challenge with the desert being a factor throughout the driving range provides a beautiful view of northeast scottsdale and you can enjoy a similar view from the 10th tee although the course is challenging enough for most players dealing with the desert on many holes can be a drawback additionally the presence of power lines along the outskirts can be visually unappealing and distracting due to their buzzing sound while this is not the greatest course in my opinion it is still worth trying out if youre looking for a new golfing experience in northeast scottsdale,played here a couple times most recently this past weekend the course is always in good shape when ive been out there and it is challenging with the desert being in play throughout the coursennthe driving range gives you a great view of northeast scottsdale while youre warming up and you get just about the same great view off of the 10 tee the course is challenging enough for most people as youre playing with desert on a lot of holes nnthe negative is that it is a tad annoying playing amongst the string of power lines that are placed along the outskirts of the course it just makes for an awkward appearance and when youre trying to line up your shot that numbing buzz of the electricity can be an unwelcome distractionnnis this a great course in my opinion no there are far better ones around the valley that you can go and play but i recommend playing here if you havent before and youre looking for a new track in ne scottsdale
