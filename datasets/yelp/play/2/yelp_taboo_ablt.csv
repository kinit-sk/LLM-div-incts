i visited the establishment for lunch this week and ordered a buffalo burger with pub fries i found the food and service to be satisfactory but nothing exceptional as i was eating during work hours i did not sample any beer which could have impacted my overall opinion despite that i am fond of a good stout,2
the staff are pleasant and the frozen treats are delicious although the food is average fast food cuisine,2
when i first received my burger tots they were lukewarm but a passing manager swiftly rectified the issue and i delighted in a hot burger the burger was mediumrare and exceptional though not comparable to a smash burger it was still a great airport burger,2
the food is exceptional though with five or more individuals queued before you anticipate an hourlong wait before being served,1
though their menu is relatively smaller the food is exceptional particularly their tartar highly recommend the calamari which may come with a higher price tag but is definitely worth the experience,3
