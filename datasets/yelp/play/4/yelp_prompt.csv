i usually enjoy this place but it seems like they might have new management since their service has been declining significantly i just tried to place a carryout order and the person who took my order was incredibly rude even hanging up on me after i said thanks this kind of behavior is not acceptable and they should reevaluate their approach to customer service especially with so many competitors in the area,1

my initial visit to this location was two weekends ago when i went with my girlfriends we had a wonderful time thanks to the hookups we got in vegas which allowed us free entry and table service what stood out to me was the pool area that opened up with its beautiful lights reflecting on the water,3

i cant express how amazing salon 84 is i discovered it 35 years ago when i needed a keratin treatment done by a hairdresser in tempe for a wedding in costa rica just 3 days before my flight previously a hairdresser had caused so much damage to my hair it was breaking off and i lost about 5 inches of length the hairdresser i was supposed to see canceled on me 30 minutes before leaving me panicked but mitra at salon 84 took me in even though she had a furniture appointment that day she not only did the treatment but saved my hair and my budget ive been going there ever since and they are always willing to squeeze me in if they can they listen to what i want and its my permanent salon great place and people 3 years and counting give them a try,4
the management at this location is unfriendly and the room lacks a coffee maker on our level there is no ice machine and the clock is broken this makes for the worst possible experience the management is rude and hangs up on guests when they try to address concerns avoid this place at all costs,0
as a lifelong thai food lover im quite discerning when it comes to this cuisine while yuphas does offer the best thai food in phoenix it doesnt quite match up to the quality of chicagos thai restaurants that i frequent on top of that the prices can be high sometimes even more expensive than in chicago one of the major concerns i have with yuphas is their inconsistency in dish quality and portion size nonetheless its a place worth trying for thai food enthusiasts but the prices might come as a shock,2
went to this establishment and ordered the kahlua pork which i should have sent back immediately unfortunately i had to suffer through it as there was an excessive amount of water on the plate causing my rice and macaroni salad to become soupy when i requested teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 the combo plate was not any better i spent over 2600 for this substandard food and it was extremely disappointing i will not be returning,0
came here twice on my honeymoon  such a delicious breakfast  hard to go wrong here  especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side  the strawberry croissant is so delicious i am still thinking about it  luckily you can order it also at the separate bouchon bakery in the venentian  love the quiche lorriane and the french toast  it was all divine,4
this place is horrible due to the management being unfriendly and the absence of a coffee maker in the room the absence of an ice machine on our level a broken clock and the rudeness of the management when addressing issues make this the worst place to stay we were hung up on when trying to resolve problems do not stay here,0
this pizza chain is renowned but the execution can be subpar there are frequent reports of customers waiting longer than expected at this specific location moreover there have been instances where people fell ill after consuming the food it is essential to ensure that the ingredients are fresh and wellmaintained the delivery process should also be expedited for better customer satisfaction,1
as a member of back alley i can attest to the dedication and motivation of the coaches and members who are not uptight or judgmental you can simply show up for the workouts or take crossfit further if you desire i never feel pressured to try new things but i always feel supported when im ready to progress members from all walks of life attend every workout and everyone is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your imperfections,4
a renowned pizza chain however the particular branch struggles in performance causing customers to wait longer than anticipated and experiencing sickness on a few occasions it is essential for the establishment to ensure their ingredients are fresh and wellmaintained and to work on expediting their delivery process,1
a cool place to take friends or business associates is cafe oso which showcases your knowledge of insider local gems being a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students the service might not be spoton at the start of the semester but the staff is making efforts and its pleasant to provide them with advice the frontofhouse guy ives has been training them for a long,3

my visit to matts was a total letdown i traveled from scottsdale because of the positive reviews but my experience was far from satisfying the restaurant was crowded with only counter seats available which turned out to be uncomfortable metal stools despite being a small woman i had to wedge myself in to avoid slipping off the food looked appetizing but lacked taste and was overcooked i wont be returning to matts after this disappointing experience,0
after checking into our hotel we reserved a dinner at mon ami gabi at the paris hotel we arrived 30 minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us its recommended to make reservations on yelp to avoid long wait times the restaurant had a lovely view of the bellagio water show and we arrived at the perfect time to watch it with some sunlight the best dining view ever the food was delicious and they had a glutenfree menu with appetizer choices complimentary glutenfree bread and warm olives were served however our server had a bad attitude and was unhelpful forgetting our fries and not refilling our sodas one salmon salad even came with a hair in it despite these issues we still enjoyed the view and the food,3

i have a great deal of respect for the first branch of loopy lornas it is consistently busy and its easy to see why they dont adhere to the standard norms despite being a bit kitschy and quaint everyone needs a place like this once in a while the new branch located on morningside road perfectly bookends the street with the other,3
incredible customer service and enormous satisfying gyros make this the top spot in town  well definitely be returning,4

on my first visit to this location i observed that the employees seemed discontented while working their smiles were not genuine and appeared forced after i mentioned the absence of smiles and friendliness my meal was served to another table people had to serve themselves because the food was not being delivered promptly it seemed like the place was disorganized,0
having read about this location in pop city i was looking forward to giving it a try however a friends lessthanenthusiastic opinion made me somewhat hesitant even though they offer a great variety of beers it would have been helpful to have a beer menu at the table rather than having to strain to read the chalkboard at the bar i tried the sarnac pumpkin which was just alright we opted for their specialties including the candied bacon as a starter which had a unique taste unfortunately the limited pizza choices left me disappointed and we ended up with the black and gold p,1
we had reserved a nonsmoking room via email through vegascom earlier in the day but upon arrival we were given a room reeking of smoke its unacceptable that this issue still occurs with the current technology south point hotel does not care about their customers and neither does vegascom as theyre only interested in making money this will be our last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegascom again,0
today was my first visit to this location it seemed like everyone was unhappy to be at work today the smiles were forced and not genuine after i made comments about the lack of smiles and friendliness nnmy meal was served to the wrong table customers were serving themselves because no one was delivering food in a timely manner it seemed disorganized and like everyone was off nnthe 6 breakfast sandwich was extremely poor value the hot chocolate was served with whipped cream instead if the chocolate chip marshmallows as depicted on the menu we had to ask for our ordered items twice as several others received their items prior to us even though we ordered before themnnwhen i asked the woman to heat up my cinnamon roll she told me to do it myself in the microwave 299 for a cinnamon roll that i have to heat myself ok not the end of the world but poor customer service,0

the crystals shopping district situated in the heart of the city center was a destination i visited last night upon entering the shopping center gave off an open and slightly vacant atmosphere but there were indeed people walking around this shopping center is distinctive in that its shops and restaurants are spread out unlike traditional malls,2
worst experience ever customer service poor have no idea about what should they know the manager was despotic caotic and mean they charged us for a nonexistent warranty when we asked for a solution everybody was rude but again the manager is the worst shouting orders and paying no attention to my,0
i normally love this place but they must have new management or something because their overall operation has been seriously deteriorating i just called for a carry out order and had the rudest man take my order literally just hung up on me when i was saying thanks after i was done ordering wow bad business practices they should reexamine their service with so much competition in the same area,1
4 the breakfast buffet is another highlight with crispy bacon and even portuguese sausage however the scrambled eggs can be a bit runny,3
after checking into our hotel we reserved a dinner at mon ami gabi at the paris hotel we arrived 30 minutes early but were seated promptly due to outdoor seating availability reservations are recommended on yelp to avoid a long wait the restaurant had a lovely view of the bellagio water show and we arrived just in time to watch it with some sunlight the dining view was one of the best,3
great pizza chain but so so in execution usually have to wait longer than usual for this location and felt sick a couple times hope their ingredients are fresh and being well taken care of the delivery should be more faster,1
when considering getting a piercing it is vital to be aware that although some piercing places may offer the option of using a gun it can be a violent and painful experience it is essential to take responsibility for your choices and weigh the potential risks and discomfort associated with using a gun for piercing,4
i have immense admiration for the first branch of loopy lornas it is always crowded and it is not hard to see why they deviate from the norm although it is slightly cheesy and oldfashioned everyone needs a place like this occasionally the new branch situated on morningside road perfectly complements the other branch which is located inside the impressive church hill theatre the dining room is luxurious and refined and there is also a spacious outdoor seating area overlooking the busy street they have retained all the elements that made the first loopy lornas so successful an extensive range of cakes and treats an assortment of specialty teas served in bone china cups amusing tea cozies and sandwiches while it is pricey at £10 for a sandwich and a pot of tea it is an indulgence worth having,3
at a chevron gas station you can find a selfserve car wash for your convenience,4
on two occasions during my honeymoon i partook in this establishments magnificent breakfast its quite difficult to make a wrong choice especially with the inclusion of the lyonnaise potatoes as a side the strawberry croissant was so delicious,4
its unfortunate that despite the magnificent view of the valley the menu food and service were underwhelming the food was served lukewarm and was merely passable,2
back alley crossfit is changing my life i decided to see what the fitness fuss was about crossfit two months ago by dropping by their saturday 9am class from the first drop of sweat i was totally hooked where else can a motivated 30something finally get her baby fat off and start rebuilding her vitality with a fantastic community of support laughter and personal coachingnnabout back alley a member perspective nthe coaches and members are dedicated and motivating  without being uptight or judgmental so throw away the i dont want to work out with a bunch of meatheads excuse you can just show up to the workouts or you can take crossfit much further if you want i never feel pressured to try new stuff but i always feel supported when im ready to go to the next level   nnmembers from all walks of life are at every workout and every one of them is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your fat rolls even in the unlikely event that they cared about that so you cant use the im too selfconsciousoldflabby excuse nnthe atmosphere is casual and fun but with that critical element of friendly competition to keep you from slacking off too much have problems with accountability i do this gym makes me want to go back every time nnthey are familyfriendly and the kiddos have their very own space so they stay safe and arent distracting so throw the i cant findpay for a sitter excuse out the window nndont have time they do they have both morning and evening classes this is one of the biggest reasons i can make 34 classes a week here because my schedule changes a lot and lets face it if i can fit the workout in at 630pm rather than the 530am class im soooo sleeping innnpeople always talk about drinking the crossfit koolaid i dont feel like im obligated to do anything here i love doing the workouts so i go back again and again because it is a great match for me and the way i want to get fit so dont worry if its not for you  but you cant use that excuse until you try it at least three times in my honest opinion  nnno they did not bribe me to write this i really totally dig back alley and everyone deserves to know how freaking fantastic they are nnhope to see you there soon,4
the service at this place is just okay but the food selection is only average the food itself is passable though the prices are high warranting a twostar rating to be frank its not worth the money although its open late the limited options make it less appealing,1
the bathrooms resemble those of a dive bar as they seem to be unchecked throughout the evening nonetheless the restaurant is suited for families and the bar staff are phenomenal,2
a couple of weeks ago i had a blast in vegas and made my way to the luxor which houses the lax nightclub the hotel staff suggested this club as the ideal place for dancing and we were lucky to receive complimentary passes with a free drink i spent most of my time on the dance floor grooving to the hiphop and top 40 tunes although the drink prices were steep the experience was worth it i regretted not wearing flipflops since i danced for a long time,2
disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day,1
during my only visit to this venue two weekends ago i had a great time with my girlfriends thanks to the hookups we got in vegas we were able to be at the front of the line enter for free and receive free table service i especially loved how the venue opened up to the pool area as it was breathtaking with the lights reflecting off the water,3
it was disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not in a good way we started with calamari in chili sauce which was fresh and tender but it was breaded and covered in so much sauce that it became mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or a little side of sauce to spoon onto the dish the entree i ordered veal parm was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti was remarkable one of the best ive ever had but everything else was quite lackluster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 on again value for money and while i understand this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business so they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day,1
this eatery is situated on the ground floor and operates round the clock the employees are extremely friendly and helpful and youll hear aloha spoken here frequently the best part about this place is that the prices are quite affordable moreover the salad bar that comes with every entree is quite large and has a wide variety the broccoli crunch,3
having eaten thai food since childhood im quite particular about the cuisine although yuphas food is excellent in the phoenix area its still inferior to the chicago thai restaurants i frequently visit despite the good food the prices are high even surpassing chicago prices at times my main issue with yuphas is the inconsistency in their dishes  i had a fantastic tom yum once but terrible the next time and the house salads size varied greatly between visits in summary its definitely worth trying especially if youre a thai food connoisseur but some prices are still unbelievable,2
arriving early meant i didnt have to wait long for dinner but im not sure if i ate enough to make the buffet worthwhile i dont remember what i had that night but the large dessert section stood out to me,2
my visit to matts restaurant was an utter disappointment i drove from scottsdale because of the good things i had heard but my experience didnt meet my expectations the restaurant was busy and the only seating available was counter seating with uncomfortable metal stools the food looked appealing but was dry overcooked and lacked flavor i wont be returning to matts after this unpleasant experience,0
im usually a fan of this location but it seems like they have new management or something as their overall operation has been deteriorating i just placed a carryout order and encountered the rudest individual who took my order and actually hung up on me when i was expressing my thanks after completing my order thats poor business practice and they should reevaluate their service with so much competition in the same area,1
this restaurant is a terrific choice for weekday lunches ive dined here on several occasions and have always received excellent service we were seated right away and our drinks were constantly refilled in a timely manner during our most recent visit around 130 pm there were only a few other people so our server was very attentive the burgers are fantastic as you can have them prepared any way you like with practically any toppings you desire the bottomless fries are also a musttry  theyre big steak fries be sure to try the campfire sauce as a dipping sauce it,3
twice during my honeymoon i dined here and relished the scrumptious breakfast offerings its quite challenging to select an unsatisfactory dish especially when ordering the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so delectable that im still daydreaming about it happily you can also purchase it at the independent bouchon bakery in the venetian i adored the quiche lorraine and french toast in the end the entire experience was divine,4
my experience with their customer service was abysmal they lacked knowledge about their own procedures the manager was a dictator disorderly and nasty charging us for a nonexistent warranty the entire staff was unpleasant though the manager was particularly atrocious yelling commands and disregarding my needs,0
two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas,2
we checked into our hotel and made dinner reservations at mon ami gabi in the paris hotel we got there early but they seated us outside reserve on yelp to avoid waiting the restaurant had a beautiful view of the bellagio water show and we saw it during sunset the best dining view ever the food was delicious and they had a glutenfree menu with appetizers we got complimentary glutenfree bread and warm olives although,3
i have been eating thai food since i was young so im quite particular about it while the food at yuphas is excellent in comparison to other thai places in the area its not as good as the ones i used to frequent in chicago additionally the prices are high with some even being higher than those in chicago another issue i have is the inconsistency of the food for example the tom yum was great one time but terrible the next the house salad was also inconsistent in size despite these criticisms yuphas is definitely worth trying especially for those who are particular about their thai food however the prices are still surprisingly high,2
this place is an excellent option for weekday lunches ive visited a few times and the service has been consistently good weve always been seated quickly and our drinks are promptly refilled on our last visit around 130 pm there were just a few other patrons so our server was very attentive the burgers here are amazing  you can customize them any way you want with almost any toppings the bottomless fries are a musttry especially with their delicious campfire sauce,3
the pawn shop boasts an extensive range of jewelry appliances watches and more but unfortunately the staff i encountered on both my visits were quite impolite behaving in a haughty manner and proving to be subpar negotiators,1
5 my visit to matts was a huge letdown i made the trip from scottsdale due to positive reviews but the restaurants ambiance and food were not up to par,0
visited this place and got the kahlua pork shouldve sent it back right away but endured it the dish had so much liquid that my rice and macaroni salad turned into soup when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate wasnt much better either spent over 2600 for this poor quality food very disappointing wont be coming back,0
my visit was a complete disappoinment  i drove all the way from scottsdale because i had heard such good things about matts so i arrived hungry and with high expectations  nnthe restaurant was busy with only counter seating available so i took one of the available stools  they are very uncomfortable metal stools  the seats are round unupolstered metal smaller than most folks butts i am a small woman insufficiently contoured and very slippery i had to pull the stool in close to the counter wedge my knees against the counter and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if i would slide off  the hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that i kept looking around in to see if a table opened upnnso uncomfortably perched i decided to try the pork chop eggs hashbrowns and wheat toast  the plated food looked good  the eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter i couldnt get enought salt without opening the shaker and though i am not a heavy salter everything needed salt  the pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry overcooked difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided and tasteless seriously   i could see that the meat was seasoned but i couldnt tast whatever they used  i didnt understand the texture of the hash browns  the top and bottom were crisp and pretty good but the middle which comprised most of the order was really wetnnhungry as i was i ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns a little of the pork chop a couple bites of toast and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one i cant handle eggs alone  no big breakfast at matts for me  i was too disappointed to even complain about my meal  i just paid my check and left for the treck back to scottsdale with no plan to ever return to matts,0
after checking into our hotel we made reservations to grab dinner at monamigabi at paris hotel  we got there 30minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us make reservations on yelp or else prepare for a long wait  lovely view of the bellagio water show and we got there at a perfect time to watch it happen in some sunlight  in the darkbest dining view evernnthe good wasgluten free menu available with appetizer choices as wellreal rarity i tell ya  complimentary gluten free bread with warm delicious olives celiacs usually have to just stare at everyone at the table enjoin warm baguettes while drooling but this place is awesome regarding gluten free eaters and the scallops i ordered were seared to perfection my goodness it was delicious and 5 meaty perfect sized scallops were surrounding a pile of ratatouille im not a fan of ratatouille but it was alrightnnthe bad wasour server was horriblehe had the worst attitude and was very unhelpfulhe forgot our fries and acted like it wasnt a big deal but made a ginormous deal about bringing out complimentary fries 5minutes later  we also never got refills on 4 sodas   one of the salmon salads we ordered came out with a inch long slightly wavy hair u guess what that was nnill come backdidnt get glutened and loved the view,3
4 i ate some of the crispy hash browns a little of the pork chop a couple bites of toast and one egg i couldnt handle eating the second egg alone i was too disappointed to complain about my meal and left without planning to return to matts,0
reached the venue before the rush thus avoided a prolonged wait for dinner unsure if the buffet was worth it for me due to possibly consuming insufficient food forgotten the specific dishes i consumed but the impressive array of desserts made a lasting memory,2
despite the positive aspects the service was not up to the mark our server had a terrible attitude and was unhelpful he forgot our fries and didnt seem to care but made a big deal about bringing out complimentary fries later we also didnt get refills on our sodas one of the salmon salads came with a slightly wavy inchlong hair overall id still consider coming back,3
as someone who has been eating thai food since childhood and has experienced various thai restaurants in chicago i can say that the food at yuphas is good compared to other thai places in the area however it is still subpar when compared to the restaurants i used to visit in chicago the prices are also quite high with some even surpassing chicago prices another concern is the inconsistency of the food as i once had a great tom yum but the second time it was terrible the same goes for the house salad which had inconsistent portions overall yuphas is a place worth trying for those who are particular about their thai food,2
the service here is average and the food selection is just mediocre the food is alright but the high prices lead to a twostar rating truthfully this place isnt worth the money spent despite being open late the limited choices make it less valuable,1
got there early eliminating the need for a long wait uncertain if the buffet was value for money given that i may not have eaten enough cant recall what i ate that night but the large dessert selection left a strong impression,2
heres a great spot for lunch during the workweek that ive been to a couple of times the service is always good with quick seating and attentive staff on our most recent visit at around 130 pm we experienced great service due to few other diners the burgers are incredible as you can have them made exactly how you like and dont forget to try the bottomless fries with the tasty campfire sauce,3
a selfservice car wash can be found at a chevron gas station,4
i arrived before the rush so i didnt have to wait for dinner although im unsure if i ate enough to justify the cost of the buffet i cant recall the specific foods i ate but i was impressed by the extensive dessert selection,2
reaching the restaurant early allowed me to avoid a long wait for dinner however im uncertain if the amount i ate made the buffet worth it i dont remember my exact meal but the sizable dessert section left a lasting impression,2
after reading about this place in pop city i was really excited to try it out  a friend mentioned she wasnt the biggest fan so i was a bit skeptical after hearing that  they have a great beer selection and while i like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar i do wish they had a beer menu at your table this was very hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin and it was just ok  we didnt venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed the candied bacon for a starter was deliciousunique flavor i was disappointed with so few pizza choices we went with the black and gold but did not like the beetsi thought the flavor was too overpowering  i recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor,1
two weekends ago i visited this place for the first and only time with my girlfriends we had a great time since we got hookups in vegas which allowed us to be at the front of the line enter for free and have free table service what i appreciated about this venue was that it led to the pool area which was stunning with the lights reflecting off the water,3
the customer service was horrendous and they seemed to have no clue about their job the manager was tyrannical chaotic and cruel and charged us for a warranty that didnt exist no one was polite but the manager was the epitome of rudeness barking orders and ignoring my concerns,0
i cant say enough amazing things about salon 84 i discovered salon 84 35 years ago when i had an appointment to have a keratin treatment done with a hairdresser in tempe for a wedding in costa rica just 3 days before flying out i desperately needed the treatment as a previous hairdresser had caused significant damage to my hair leading to breaking off and eventually losing about 5 inches of length the hairdresser who was supposed to do my hair canceled on me 30 minutes before due to personal reasons leaving me in panic however when i called salon 84 and explained my situation to mitra she went above and beyond canceling her appointment to receive furniture and taking me in not only did she perform the treatment but she also saved my hair and my budget ive been a loyal customer ever since the team at salon 84 is always willing to accommodate clients if they can and they truly listen to your desires this is my permanent salon and its a great place with wonderful people three years and counting give them a try,4
my worst customer service experience involved a company that had no clue about their job and a manager who was tyrannical chaotic and mean they charged us for a warranty that didnt exist when we asked for a solution and the manager would just yell orders and not listen to me everyone there was impolite but the manager was the worst,0
the selfserve car wash mentioned earlier is affiliated with a chevron gas station,4
my enthusiasm to visit,1
one of the great aspects about this place is that their prices are quite affordable in addition the salad bar which comes included with all the main dishes is fantastic its a decent size and has a lot of variety make sure to try the broccoli crunch salad as its crunchy sweet and delicious,3
the pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry appliances watches etc nhowever the staff that i encountered both times i was there were very rude they acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators,1
the popular pizza chain has a location that needs improvement in its service delivery as customers tend to wait longer and have had instances of feeling ill after eating the quality and maintenance of ingredients must be prioritized and the speed of delivery should be increased to provide a better experience for patrons,1
despite the pawn shop having a diverse selection of items such as jewelry appliances and watches the customer service i experienced was disappointing due to the staff being very rude and having an arrogant attitude while also lacking negotiation skills,1
this establishment can be found on the ground level of the cal and is open 24 hours a day the staff is incredibly welcoming and helpful and the spirit of aloha is definitely present here,3

cafe oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know you know the insiders scoop on whats cool and local and best kept secret this is the learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end but you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice like dont say free dessert with an entree say complimentary instead plus ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so chris review below about service made no sense nni dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe hello  the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 was a bargain  you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   a large piece of fish was done perfectly dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i thought it would be light ending touch churros are usually dry cinammonsugar sticks instead i got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling just in case it wasnt sinful enough it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream honestly id come here just for this dessert if if you didnt order a main entree the 5  7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damagenni saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table the menu says 6 meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups there is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here nnhidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that cafe oso is only open from i think 11 am  1 pm tuesdays  thursdays and only when the college is in session so call ahead because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know,3

i have immense respect and admiration for loopy lornas a unique establishment where the first branch consistently bustles with activity its easy to see why they stand out as they offer a charming and quirky atmosphere that deviates from the norm though their style may be considered kitschy theres no denying that everyone needs a touch of whimsy in their lives from time to time the new branch located at the opposite end of morningside road resides within the magnificent church hill theatre and the dining room exudes opulence and sophistication an expansive outdoor seating area allows patrons to enjoy the vibrant street scene while dining,3
my initial excitement to visit this establishment in pop city was tempered by a friends disapproval while they have a strong beer selection the lack of a beer menu at the table made it difficult to see the offerings the sarnac pumpkin beer was average the candied bacon starter was delicious and unique but the limited pizza choices were disappointing especially the black and gold pizza with its overpowering beet flavor the bar area however is aesthetically pleasing with nice seating,1

i had the chance to explore the crystals shopping district located within the city center yesterday evening upon arrival the shopping center seemed quite spacious and a bit desolate even though there were people strolling around its important to mention that this isnt a typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced far apart from one another,2
meh service is decent food selection is mediocre food is okay this place is pricey hence the two star rating actually this place is not worth the money in all honesty that being said its open late choices are rather limited,1
we booked a non smoking room email earlier in the day thru vegascom when arrived we were given a smoked filled room that smelled like crap the technology exist today that this should never happen  south point doesnt care and neither does vegascom all they want is your money  this is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegascom again,0
i typically love this place but it seems like they have new management or something because their operations have been rapidly deteriorating i just tried calling for a carryout order and had the rudest person answer the phone literally hanging up on me after i said thank you for taking my order they should definitely reassess their customer service strategies especially with so many other similar businesses in the area,1
although the pizza chain is outstanding the execution is often mediocre customers typically have to wait longer than usual at this location and some have reported feeling ill on a couple of occasions it is crucial that the ingredients remain fresh and properly cared for and the delivery service should be improved for faster service,1
piercing is serious business jerry piercing guns are barbaric and hurt a lot compared to a needle yes pin cushion needs an open mind and if you want to take the gun its your right but also consider the fact you are going to a piercing place i dont think a respectable piercer would use a gun just on the basis that its violent and hurts to argue with him as to why they dont almost begs for the elitist response you got so take some responsibility for the exchange megan d im glad youre a physician but lets face it 99 of the customers are not and its the stores policy so regardless you lose to the review okay so im new to yelping or this would have been done a long time ago halo is the best place to get pierced they are nononsense and take the shit seriously they are professional this is not a tattoo shop piercing 95 of my piercings and stretching were done at halo both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 716s when i stopped the stretchings of my septum were 8g and lebret,4
at mon ami gabi they offered a glutenfree menu with appetizer options this was a rare find for celiac customers who usually cant enjoy warm baguettes like others at the table the complimentary glutenfree bread with warm olives was a delightful touch my scallops were cooked to perfection and surrounded by ratatouille which im not a fan of but it was okay,3
arrived ahead of time therefore didnt have a lengthy wait for the meal uncertain if the buffet was costeffective for me as i might not have consumed enough food dont remember what i ate that evening but the extensive dessert section left a lasting impression,2

there is a car wash that you can use by yourself and its located at a chevron gas station,4
exceptional customer service and the tastiest gyros in town theyre enormous and incredibly filling making us eager to come back,4
during my initial visit to this place it appeared that the staff members were unhappy to be at work their smiles seemed artificial and insincere after expressing my thoughts about the lack of smiles and friendliness my meal was served to the wrong table customers were forced to serve themselves since the food was not being delivered in a timely manner the atmosphere seemed chaotic and the staff seemed off their game the breakfast sandwich i ordered was not worth its price and the hot chocolate came with whipped cream instead of the chocolate chip marshmallows as shown on the menu we had to request our ordered items twice as other customers received theirs before us even though we had ordered before them when i asked the woman to warm up my cinnamon roll she told me to do it myself in the microwave paying 299 for a cinnamon roll that i had to heat up myself was not the best customer service experience,0
best gyros in town awesome customer service the gyros are huge and so filling well be back,4
it is important to take into account that while some people may choose to use a piercing gun its crucial to understand that it can be a violent and painful experience although a piercing place may offer this option it is essential to consider the potential discomfort and possible consequences,4
essentially the restrooms resemble a dive bar with no one overseeing them during the evening in a family restaurant on the other hand the bar staff is incredible,2
earlier in the day we had reserved a nonsmoking room via email through vegascom but when we arrived we were assigned a room that smelled terrible due to cigarette smoke in this day and age there is no excuse for this issue to persist south point hotel and vegascom do not care about their customers as they are only after making,0
this location is terrible due to the unfriendly management lack of a coffee maker in the room and absence of an ice machine on our level the broken clock further adds to the dissatisfaction i would never stay here again as the management is impolite when addressing concerns and disregards us,0
i usually enjoy visiting this place but it appears that theys new management or a change of some sort because the quality of their operations has noticeably worsened i just called to order takeout and had the rudest person handle my order and they even hung up on me when i was thanking them after i finished ordering this is unacceptable behavior and they should examine their customer service strategies especially given the high level of competition in the same area,1
i went to this place and ordered the kahlua pork in hindsight i should have sent it back immediately but i endured it there was way too much water on the plate turning my rice and macaroni salad into a soupy mess when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the com,0
it was quite disappointing to say the least this was our second visit and i didnt want to go back after the experience the service was decent but the food and price were surprisingly not good the calamari was fresh but the breading and excessive sauce made it mushy and unappetizing the veal parm was decent but not spectacular and the only remarkable dish was the spaghetti however the value for money wasnt there and i wouldnt be willing to spend another 200 at this place,1
the service is soso the food selection is mediocre and the food is just okay due to the high prices this place only gets a twostar rating in reality its not worth the money spent while its open late the limited choices make it less attractive,1
despite the pawn shops extensive selection of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i encountered on both occasions were impolite pretentious and not adept at negotiating,1
my first visit to this location was disappointing as the staff seemed unhappy and unfriendly after commenting on the lack of smiles my meal was served to the wrong table and customers had to serve themselves due to slow service the place was disorganized and the staff appeared to be off the breakfast sandwich was overpriced and the hot chocolate was served with whipped cream instead of chocolate chip marshmallows as depicted on the menu we had to ask for our orders twice as others received theirs before us when i asked for my cinnamon roll to be heated the woman told me to do it myself in the microwave paying 299 for a cinnamon roll that i had to heat myself was poor customer service,0
i have a lot of respect and admiration for loopy lornas the first branch is always heaving and its not difficult to see why theyre not quite following the mould sure its kitsch and quaint but we all need that from time to timennthis new branch bookends morningside road with the other one set inside the magnificent church hill theatre the dining room is decadent and elegant theres a big outdoor seating area too overlooking the busy street nntheyve got all the things that made the first loopy lornas such a hit  a massive selection of cakes and treats numerous speciality teas served in bone china cups those silly in a good way tea cosies sandwiches and what not at u00a310 for a sandwich and a pot of tea its a treat only place but what a treat it isnnits funny i should really hate this place its so twee and its too expensive but they do it so well you cant help but love it,3
two weeks ago i was enjoying myself in las vegas and ended up at the luxor where lax nightclub is located hotel staff recommended it as a great place to dance and since we got free passes for entry and a free first drink my friends and i decided to check it out the club had a big space with an upstairs but i spent most of my time downstairs due to the great hiphoptop 40 music i danced for 23 hours straight the only downside was the price of the drinks which were expensive even compared to other vegas bars i also wished i had worn flipflops instead of heels since i danced so much overall it was a good experience and i might visit again,2
however the expensive drinks were a downside although they were not much more costly than other bars in vegas the total bill was still quite high i probably should have opted for flipflops instead of heels considering the intensity of the dance session overall it was not a bad place and i might consider visiting again which would mean another trip to vegas,2
getting a piercing is a significant matter and piercing guns are quite brutal and cause a lot of pain when compared to using a needle its true that a piercing place may offer the option of using a gun but its important to remember that it can be a violent and painful process,4
this place is horrible the management is unfriendly and theres no coffee maker in the room or an ice machine on our level the clock is broken and its the worst i wouldnt stay here again because the management is rude when we bring up issues and ignores us,0
sadly even though the scenery of the valley was impressive the menu options food quality and service were a bit of a letdown the meal was served tepid and only passable,2
on two occasions during my honeymoon i enjoyed a delightful breakfast at this location its tough to go wrong especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so scrumptious that im still thinking about it and its also available at the,4
this establishment can be found on the ground level of the building and operates 24 hours a day the staff is incredibly warm and accommodating and youre sure to hear aloha spoken here one of the best things about this place is that the prices are very reasonable in addition the salad bar that comes with every entree is excellent in size and variety a musttry dish is the broccoli crunch salad which is both crunchy and sweet the saimin here is reminiscent of homecooked meals in hawaii and the prime rib special is a personal favorite although the prime rib quality can vary the breakfast buffet is also a hit with crispy bacon and the option to try portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs could be improved though overall this is a toprated restaurant in the area for both its food and prices just be prepared for it to get busy at times,3
my first and only time here was two weekends ago i had a good time with my girlfriends we got hookups in vegas so we were pretty much at the front of the line got in for free and free table service what i liked about this place was that it opened up to the pool area it was gorgeous out there with the lights reflecting off the water,3
despite the stunning valley view the menu food and service were somewhat unsatisfactory the meal was served lukewarm and only average,2
although the pawn shop offers a wide variety of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i encountered during my visits were unpleasant acted pretentiously and were ineffective negotiators,1

yesterday evening i had the opportunity to visit the crystals shopping district situated within the magnificent city center upon entering the actual shopping center felt spacious and somewhat deserted despite the presence of people strolling around please note that this is not your typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced widely apart there are threestory louis v and a host of other ultrapremium shops that can only be matched by palazzo encore or the forums additionally there is a stylish coffee shop on the bottom level called the cup as well as a few restaurants upstairs such as puck pods and the trendy beso beso also shares its building with eve lounge my goal for visiting crystals was to check out todd englishs the pub for which i have written a review overall i am looking forward to future visits and trying out the cup in the luxurious crystals shopping district,2
earlier today we reserved a nonsmoking room via vegascom and received a confirmation email however upon arrival we were assigned a room reeking of smoke and filth modern technology should prevent such errors but south point and vegascom seem unconcerned their primary focus is obtaining your money this will be my final visit to this hotel and i will never use vegascom again,0
as a member i can attest that the coaches and members at back alley are dedicated and motivating without being uptight or judgmental throw away the excuse of not wanting to work out with a bunch of meatheads because you can simply show up to the workouts or take crossfit as far as youd like i never feel pressured to try new things but always feel supported when im ready to advance to the next level,4
the restroom situation is comparable to that of a dive bar where no one checks on them all night in a family restaurant but the bar staff is outstanding,2
5 overall this is the best restaurant in the cal as it offers a combination of good food and reasonable prices just be mindful that it can get quite busy at times,3
i experienced an unpleasant first visit to this location as the employees appeared unhappy and insincere after mentioning the absence of smiles and friendliness my meal was mistakenly served to another table and customers had to help themselves with food due to the slow delivery the environment seemed disorganized and the staff seemed off the breakfast sandwich was poor value for money and the hot chocolate came with whipped cream instead of the chocolate chip marshmallows as advertised we had to request our orders twice as other,0
im usually a fan of this establishment but it appears that theyve changed management or something as their overall performance has been on a downward spiral i recently called to place a carryout order and the person who took my call was shockingly impolite even going so far as to hang up on me when i expressed gratitude after ordering this isnt a good business practice and they should rethink their approach to customer service given the fierce competition in the area,1
the service is adequate but the food selection is just average the food itself is okay but this place is expensive which is why it only gets a twostar rating to be frank this place isnt worth the money however it does stay open late and there arent many other options available,1
one of the cool places to take friends or business associates is cafe oso as it shows you know about the local cool and bestkept secrets its a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service may not be perfect at the beginning of the semester but the staff is trying and its nice to give them advice the frontofhouse guy ives has been training them for a long time,3
i went to this restaurant and ordered the kahlua pork but i shouldve sent it back immediately my rice and mac salad turned into a soup because there was so much water on my plate they charged me 27 for teriyaki sauce and the combo plate was also not good i paid over 26 for a terrible meal and wont return,0
cafe oso is a trendy place where you can take friends or business associates to show them you know whats cool and local in the area as a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students the service at the beginning of the semester may not be as polished as towards the end but its nice to give them advice like using the term complimentary instead of free when referring to dessert the renovation of the cafe and its menu has resulted in creative dishes at affordable prices such as the crispy skin salmon entree the desserts like the chocolate churro are not to be missed and are worth the indulgence,3
we had booked a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier in the day via email however when we arrived we were given a room filled with the stench of cigarette smoke with todays technology situations like these should not occur both south point hotel and vegascom lack concern for their customers as they are only focused on making money consequently this will be our last stay at this hotel and we will never utilize vegascom again,0

we booked a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and we received an email confirmation when we arrived at the hotel we were given a room that was filled with smoke and smelled terrible it is unacceptable that with todays technology this kind of mistake could still happen south point and vegascom do not care about their customers all they want is their money as a result i will never stay at this hotel again and i will never use vegascom,0

loopy lornas has garnered much admiration and respect due to its distinctive character and its refusal to conform to traditional standards the first branch of this establishment has consistently shown a high level of activity and has successfully carved out a unique niche despite its kitschy and quaint appearance it is evident that people crave the whimsical charm that loopy lornas provides the new branch situated on the other end of morningside road within the church hill theatre boasts a lavish dining room and a spacious outdoor seating area that overlooks the bustling,3
ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices,2

this experience was extremely disappointing we visited for the second time but the subpar food price and service made me not want to return the calamari was fresh and tender but it was ruined by being breaded and drenched in an overwhelming amount of sauce the veal parm was decent but nothing special and the spaghetti was quite remarkable however the overall experience was not worth the high cost and i dont believe its a place id spend another 200 at,1
this is another spot for lunch during the week  ive been here a couple of times and the service has always been good  we have always been seated right away and drinks are always refilled in a timely manner  our last visit was later in the afternoon around 130pm  there were just a few others there so our server was very attentive  i love the burgers here you can get a burger any way you want with almost anything on it  the bottomless fries are great too  they are big steak fries  try a side of campfire sauce with them  yum,3
