we checked into our hotel and made dinner reservations at mon ami gabi in the paris hotel we got there early but they seated us outside reserve on yelp to avoid waiting the restaurant had a beautiful view of the bellagio water show and we saw it during sunset the best dining view ever the food was delicious and they had a glutenfree menu with appetizers we got complimentary glutenfree bread and warm olives although,1
during my honeymoon i had the pleasure of visiting this place twice and indulging in their delightful breakfast options its hard to go wrong with their dishes especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so incredibly delicious that i still reminisce about it luckily you can also order it from the separate bouchon bakery in the venetian the quiche lorraine and french toast were equally mouthwatering making the whole experience truly divine,0
went to this establishment and ordered the kahlua pork which i should have sent back immediately unfortunately i had to suffer through it as there was an excessive amount of water on the plate causing my rice and macaroni salad to become soupy when i requested teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 the combo plate was not any better i spent over 2600 for this substandard food and it was extremely disappointing i will not be returning,4
this restaurant is a wonderful option for weekday lunches i have been here a few times and the service has consistently been great we were seated promptly and our drinks were refilled in a timely manner our last visit was later in the afternoon around 130 pm and there were only a few other people so our server was very attentive i love the burgers here  you can customize them any way you want with almost any toppings the bottomless fries are fantastic too they are big steak fries try a side of campfire sauce with them  its delicious,1
self serve car wash and its a chevron,0
the customer service was horrendous and they seemed to have no clue about their job the manager was tyrannical chaotic and cruel and charged us for a warranty that didnt exist no one was polite but the manager was the epitome of rudeness barking orders and ignoring my concerns,4
reached the venue early eliminating a prolonged wait for dinner unsure if the buffet was value for money given that i may not have eaten enough cant recall what i ate that night but the large dessert selection left a strong impression,2
i have a lot of respect and admiration for loopy lornas the first branch is always heaving and its not difficult to see why theyre not quite following the mould sure its kitsch and quaint but we all need that from time to timennthis new branch bookends morningside road with the other one set inside the magnificent church hill theatre the dining room is decadent and elegant theres a big outdoor seating area too overlooking the busy street nntheyve got all the things that made the first loopy lornas such a hit  a massive selection of cakes and treats numerous speciality teas served in bone china cups those silly in a good way tea cosies sandwiches and what not at u00a310 for a sandwich and a pot of tea its a treat only place but what a treat it isnnits funny i should really hate this place its so twee and its too expensive but they do it so well you cant help but love it,1
back alley crossfit is transforming my life and i decided to investigate the fitness hype surrounding crossfit two months ago by attending their saturday 9am class from the first drop of sweat i was hooked as its a place where a motivated 30something can finally shed their baby fat and start rebuilding their vitality with a fantastic community of support laughter and personal coaching,0
i have immense admiration for the first branch of loopy lornas it is always crowded and it is not hard to see why they deviate from the norm although it is slightly cheesy and oldfashioned everyone needs a place like this occasionally the new branch situated on morningside road perfectly complements the other branch which is located inside the impressive church hill theatre the dining room is luxurious and refined and there is also a spacious outdoor seating area overlooking the busy street they have retained all the elements that made the first loopy lornas so successful an extensive range of cakes and treats an assortment of specialty teas served in bone china cups amusing tea cozies and sandwiches while it is pricey at Â£10 for a sandwich and a pot of tea it is an indulgence worth having,1
cafe oso is a trendy place where you can take friends or business associates to show them you know whats cool and local in the area as a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students the service at the beginning of the semester may not be as polished as towards the end but its nice to give them advice like using the term complimentary instead of free when referring to dessert the renovation of the cafe and its menu has resulted in creative dishes at affordable prices such as the crispy skin salmon entree the desserts like the chocolate churro are not to be missed and are worth the indulgence,1
my initial visit to this location was two weekends ago when i went with my girlfriends we had a wonderful time thanks to the hookups we got in vegas which allowed us free entry and table service what stood out to me was the pool area that opened up with its beautiful lights reflecting on the water,1
arrived ahead of time therefore didnt have a lengthy wait for the meal uncertain if the buffet was costeffective for me as i might not have consumed enough food dont remember what i ate that evening but the extensive dessert section left a lasting impression,2
this establishment can be found on the ground level of the building and operates 24 hours a day the staff is incredibly warm and accommodating and youre sure to hear aloha spoken here one of the best things about this place is that the prices are very reasonable in addition the salad bar that comes with every entree is excellent in size and variety a musttry dish is the broccoli crunch salad which is both crunchy and sweet the saimin here is reminiscent of homecooked meals in hawaii and the prime rib special is a personal favorite although the prime rib quality can vary the breakfast buffet is also a hit with crispy bacon and the option to try portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs could be improved though overall this is a toprated restaurant in the area for both its food and prices just be prepared for it to get busy at times,1
although the pizza chain is outstanding the execution is often mediocre customers typically have to wait longer than usual at this location and some have reported feeling ill on a couple of occasions it is crucial that the ingredients remain fresh and properly cared for and the delivery service should be improved for faster service,3
4 this location is terrible due to the unfriendly management lack of a coffee maker in the room and absence of an ice machine on our level the broken clock further adds to the dissatisfaction i would never stay here again as the management is impolite when addressing concerns and disregards us,4
my visit to the restaurant was extremely disappointing i drove from scottsdale because i heard good things about matts but my experience was far from satisfying,4
back alley crossfit is changing my life i decided to see what the fitness fuss was about crossfit two months ago by dropping by their saturday 9am class from the first drop of sweat i was totally hooked where else can a motivated 30something finally get her baby fat off and start rebuilding her vitality with a fantastic community of support laughter and personal coachingnnabout back alley a member perspective nthe coaches and members are dedicated and motivating  without being uptight or judgmental so throw away the i dont want to work out with a bunch of meatheads excuse you can just show up to the workouts or you can take crossfit much further if you want i never feel pressured to try new stuff but i always feel supported when im ready to go to the next level   nnmembers from all walks of life are at every workout and every one of them is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your fat rolls even in the unlikely event that they cared about that so you cant use the im too selfconsciousoldflabby excuse nnthe atmosphere is casual and fun but with that critical element of friendly competition to keep you from slacking off too much have problems with accountability i do this gym makes me want to go back every time nnthey are familyfriendly and the kiddos have their very own space so they stay safe and arent distracting so throw the i cant findpay for a sitter excuse out the window nndont have time they do they have both morning and evening classes this is one of the biggest reasons i can make 34 classes a week here because my schedule changes a lot and lets face it if i can fit the workout in at 630pm rather than the 530am class im soooo sleeping innnpeople always talk about drinking the crossfit koolaid i dont feel like im obligated to do anything here i love doing the workouts so i go back again and again because it is a great match for me and the way i want to get fit so dont worry if its not for you  but you cant use that excuse until you try it at least three times in my honest opinion  nnno they did not bribe me to write this i really totally dig back alley and everyone deserves to know how freaking fantastic they are nnhope to see you there soon,0
i was eager to visit this place in pop city after reading about it but a friends unfavorable opinion made me uncertain although they have a fantastic beer selection i wish there was a beer menu at the table since the chalkboard at the bar was hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin beer which was just average we ordered their specialties and the candied bacon starter was delicious but i was unhappy with the limited pizza options we chose the black and gold pizza but didnt enjoy the beet flavor i suggest going for drinks as the bar has a nice seating area and trendy decor,3
the best gyros in town are not only huge and filling but also come with fantastic customer service  we cant wait to come back,0

disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day,3
this place can be found on the ground floor and it operates round the clock the employees are extremely friendly and helpful and youll hear aloha spoken frequently the best part about this place is that the prices are quite affordable moreover the salad bar that comes with every entree is quite large and has a wide variety a musttry dish is the broccoli crunch which is both crunchy and sweet,1
this place is awful the management is unfriendly no coffee maker in the room no ice machine on out level the clock is broken absolute worst nnnwould never stay here  the management is rude when we c about issues and low us off dont stay here,4
got there early eliminating the need for a long wait uncertain if the buffet was value for money given that i may not have eaten enough cant recall what i ate that night but the large dessert selection left a strong impression,2
we made a reservation for a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and received a confirmation email upon arrival we were assigned a room filled with smoke and smelling like garbage the technology exists to prevent such errors yet south point and vegascom do not care about their customers they are only interested in taking their money consequently i will never stay at,4
the experience left me disappointed as this was our second visit and i didnt want to return while the service was acceptable the food and price were surprisingly poor the calamari was initially fresh and tender but was ruined by being breaded and drenched in an overwhelming amount of sauce,3
if youre searching for a new place to have lunch during the week this is an excellent choice ive dined here on multiple occasions and the service has always been superb we were seated right away and our drinks were constantly refilled during our last visit around 130 pm there were just a few other customers so our server was very attentive the burgers are incredible as you can have them prepared any way you like with practically any toppings dont forget the bottomless steak fries  theyre huge try dipping them in their campfire sauce for an added treat,1
two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas,2
we booked a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and received an email confirmation when we arrived at the hotel we were given a room that was filled with smoke and smelled terrible it is unacceptable that with todays technology this kind of mistake could still happen south point and vegascom do not care about their customers all they want is their money as a result i will never stay,4
my first and only time here was two weekends ago i had a good time with my girlfriends we got hookups in vegas so we were pretty much at the front of the line got in for free and free table service what i liked about this place was that it opened up to the pool area it was gorgeous out there with the lights reflecting off the water,1
cafe oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know you know the insiders scoop on whats cool and local and best kept secret this is the learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end but you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice like dont say free dessert with an entree say complimentary instead plus ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so chris review below about service made no sense nni dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe hello  the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 was a bargain  you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   a large piece of fish was done perfectly dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i thought it would be light ending touch churros are usually dry cinammonsugar sticks instead i got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling just in case it wasnt sinful enough it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream honestly id come here just for this dessert if if you didnt order a main entree the 5  7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damagenni saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table the menu says 6 meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups there is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here nnhidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that cafe oso is only open from i think 11 am  1 pm tuesdays  thursdays and only when the college is in session so call ahead because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know,1
the restaurant was busy so i had to sit on an uncomfortable metal stool with no padding the seat was too small for most people and slippery making it difficult to sit on,4
i had the chance to explore the crystals shopping district within the city center yesterday evening upon arrival the shopping center seemed quite spacious and a bit desolate even though there were people strolling around its important to mention that this isnt a typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced far apart from one another,2
im new to yelping so this review should have been done a long time ago halo is the best place to get pierced because they are professional and take the process seriously this is not a tattoo shop 95 of my piercings and stretching were done at halo including both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 716s when i stopped the stretchings of my septum which was 8g and the lebret which was 10g the service is always top,0
this establishment can be found on the ground level of the building and operates 24 hours a day the staff is incredibly warm and accommodating and youre sure to hear aloha spoken here,1
this place is located on the ground floor in the cal it is 24 hours the staff is very friendly and helpful aloha is definitely spoken here nnfirst of all the prices are cheap also the salad bar which comes with all the entrees is great its a pretty good size with variety get the broccoli crunch salad its crunchy and sweet and yummy nnthe saimin in just like home in hawaii the prime rib special is my favorite the prime rib is pretty good ive had good pieces and a few bad nnthe breakfast buffet is also pretty good the bacon was crispy and they even had portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs were runny nnthis is my favorite restaurant in the cal food and prices are good just be warned it can get busy,1
the pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry appliances watches etc nhowever the staff that i encountered both times i was there were very rude they acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators,3
although the view of the valley was spectacular the menu selections food quality and service were disappointing the meal was served tepid and just okay,2
unfortunately the menu food and service were not as impressive as the magnificent view of the valley the food came out lukewarm and was only passable,2

this is a great spot,1
this eatery is situated on the ground floor and operates round the clock the employees are extremely friendly and helpful and youll hear aloha spoken here frequently the best part about this place is that the prices are quite affordable moreover the salad bar that comes with every entree is quite large and has a wide variety the broccoli crunch,1
however the expensive drinks were a downside although they were not much more costly than other bars in vegas the total bill was still quite high i probably should have opted for flipflops instead of heels considering the intensity of the dance session overall it was not a bad place and i might consider visiting again which would mean another trip to vegas,2
sadly even though the scenery of the valley was impressive the menu options food quality and service were a bit of a letdown the meal was served tepid and only passable,2
although the pawn shop offers a wide variety of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i encountered during my visits were unpleasant acted pretentiously and were ineffective negotiators,3
on my initial visit to this place it seemed like the staff members were unhappy to be at work their smiles seemed artificial and insincere after expressing my thoughts about the lack of smiles and friendliness my meal was served to the wrong table customers were forced to serve themselves since the food was not being delivered in a timely manner the atmosphere seemed chaotic and the staff seemed off their game,4
meh service is decent food selection is mediocre food is okay this place is pricey hence the two star rating actually this place is not worth the money in all honesty that being said its open late choices are rather limited,3
during my first visit to this location it appeared that everyone was unhappy to be working there the smiles they gave off seemed forced and not genuine after commenting on the absence of genuine smiles and friendliness my meal was served to the wrong table customers had to serve themselves because the food wasnt delivered promptly it seemed disorganized and the staff members seemed off,4
the crystals shopping district situated in the heart of the city center was a destination i visited last night upon entering the shopping center gave off an open and slightly vacant atmosphere but there were indeed people walking around this shopping center is distinctive in that its shops and restaurants are spread out unlike traditional malls,2
cafe oso is a cool place where you can impress your friends or business partners by demonstrating your knowledge of insider tips on whats trendy and local the cafe is a learning environment for phoenix colleges culinary students so service might not be perfect at the start of the semester but its sweet to see them trying and giving them advice like using complimentary instead of free when referring to desserts a renovation has transformed the cafe and its menu into a spot that serves creative fare at good prices one example is the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro which is a steal at 10 desserts like the chocolate churro are worth every penny so make sure to give them a try however keep in mind that the cafe is only open from 11 am to 1 pm on tuesdays and thursdays and only during college sessions so call ahead to avoid disappointment,1
after checking into our hotel we made reservations to grab dinner at monamigabi at paris hotel  we got there 30minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us make reservations on yelp or else prepare for a long wait  lovely view of the bellagio water show and we got there at a perfect time to watch it happen in some sunlight  in the darkbest dining view evernnthe good wasgluten free menu available with appetizer choices as wellreal rarity i tell ya  complimentary gluten free bread with warm delicious olives celiacs usually have to just stare at everyone at the table enjoin warm baguettes while drooling but this place is awesome regarding gluten free eaters and the scallops i ordered were seared to perfection my goodness it was delicious and 5 meaty perfect sized scallops were surrounding a pile of ratatouille im not a fan of ratatouille but it was alrightnnthe bad wasour server was horriblehe had the worst attitude and was very unhelpfulhe forgot our fries and acted like it wasnt a big deal but made a ginormous deal about bringing out complimentary fries 5minutes later  we also never got refills on 4 sodas   one of the salmon salads we ordered came out with a inch long slightly wavy hair u guess what that was nnill come backdidnt get glutened and loved the view,1

ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices,2
the service here is average and the food selection is just mediocre the food is alright but the high prices lead to a twostar rating truthfully this place isnt worth the money spent despite being open late the limited choices make it less valuable,3
