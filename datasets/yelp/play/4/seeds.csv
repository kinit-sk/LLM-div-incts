this place is awful the management is unfriendly no coffee maker in the room no ice machine on out level the clock is broken absolute worst nnnwould never stay here  the management is rude when we c about issues and low us off dont stay here,0
my visit was a complete disappoinment  i drove all the way from scottsdale because i had heard such good things about matts so i arrived hungry and with high expectations  nnthe restaurant was busy with only counter seating available so i took one of the available stools  they are very uncomfortable metal stools  the seats are round unupolstered metal smaller than most folks butts i am a small woman insufficiently contoured and very slippery i had to pull the stool in close to the counter wedge my knees against the counter and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if i would slide off  the hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that i kept looking around in to see if a table opened upnnso uncomfortably perched i decided to try the pork chop eggs hashbrowns and wheat toast  the plated food looked good  the eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter i couldnt get enought salt without opening the shaker and though i am not a heavy salter everything needed salt  the pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry overcooked difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided and tasteless seriously   i could see that the meat was seasoned but i couldnt tast whatever they used  i didnt understand the texture of the hash browns  the top and bottom were crisp and pretty good but the middle which comprised most of the order was really wetnnhungry as i was i ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns a little of the pork chop a couple bites of toast and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one i cant handle eggs alone  no big breakfast at matts for me  i was too disappointed to even complain about my meal  i just paid my check and left for the treck back to scottsdale with no plan to ever return to matts,0
worst experience ever customer service poor have no idea about what should they know the manager was despotic caotic and mean they charged us for a nonexistent warranty when we asked for a solution everybody was rude but again the manager is the worst shouting orders and paying no attention to my,0
today was my first visit to this location it seemed like everyone was unhappy to be at work today the smiles were forced and not genuine after i made comments about the lack of smiles and friendliness nnmy meal was served to the wrong table customers were serving themselves because no one was delivering food in a timely manner it seemed disorganized and like everyone was off nnthe 6 breakfast sandwich was extremely poor value the hot chocolate was served with whipped cream instead if the chocolate chip marshmallows as depicted on the menu we had to ask for our ordered items twice as several others received their items prior to us even though we ordered before themnnwhen i asked the woman to heat up my cinnamon roll she told me to do it myself in the microwave 299 for a cinnamon roll that i have to heat myself ok not the end of the world but poor customer service,0
we booked a non smoking room email earlier in the day thru vegascom when arrived we were given a smoked filled room that smelled like crap the technology exist today that this should never happen  south point doesnt care and neither does vegascom all they want is your money  this is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegascom again,0
went here and ordered the kahlua pork i should of sent it back immediately but suffered thru it there was so much water on my dish that my rice and macaroni salad turned soupy when i asked for teryaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate was not much better over 2600 for slop very disappointing i will not return,0
i normally love this place but they must have new management or something because their overall operation has been seriously deteriorating i just called for a carry out order and had the rudest man take my order literally just hung up on me when i was saying thanks after i was done ordering wow bad business practices they should reexamine their service with so much competition in the same area,1
meh service is decent food selection is mediocre food is okay this place is pricey hence the two star rating actually this place is not worth the money in all honesty that being said its open late choices are rather limited,1
great pizza chain but so so in execution usually have to wait longer than usual for this location and felt sick a couple times hope their ingredients are fresh and being well taken care of the delivery should be more faster,1
the pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry appliances watches etc nhowever the staff that i encountered both times i was there were very rude they acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators,1
disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day,1
after reading about this place in pop city i was really excited to try it out  a friend mentioned she wasnt the biggest fan so i was a bit skeptical after hearing that  they have a great beer selection and while i like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar i do wish they had a beer menu at your table this was very hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin and it was just ok  we didnt venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed the candied bacon for a starter was deliciousunique flavor i was disappointed with so few pizza choices we went with the black and gold but did not like the beetsi thought the flavor was too overpowering  i recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor,1
well the restrooms are similar to a dive bar no one seems to check on them throughout the night a family restaurant   the bar staff are phenononal,2
great view of the valley unfortunately the menu food and service were a little disappointing food came out luke warm and was just okay,2
i had a chance to visit the crystals shopping district located inside the fabulous city center yesterday evening  upon my entrance the actual shopping center felt open and slightly desolate  dont get me wrong there did happen to be people walking around however the shopsrestaurant are spaced so widennthis isnt your typical shopping mall  three story louie v and a slue of other ultrapremium shops that can only be matched by palazzo encore or the forums  they have a slick looking coffee shop on the bottom level by the name of the cup  a couple of restaurants upstairs from puck to pods and the flavor of the month beso  beso also happens to share their building with eve loungenni came to crystals with a goal in mind of visiting todd englishs the pub which i have also written a review for  overall i look forward to future visits and im eager to try a cup in the lavish shopping district of crystals,2
ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices,2
came early so didnt have to wait long for dinner i probably didnt eat enough to make the buffet worth it for me  i dont even recall what i ate that night but i was impressed by the huge dessert section,2
two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas,2
after checking into our hotel we made reservations to grab dinner at monamigabi at paris hotel  we got there 30minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us make reservations on yelp or else prepare for a long wait  lovely view of the bellagio water show and we got there at a perfect time to watch it happen in some sunlight  in the darkbest dining view evernnthe good wasgluten free menu available with appetizer choices as wellreal rarity i tell ya  complimentary gluten free bread with warm delicious olives celiacs usually have to just stare at everyone at the table enjoin warm baguettes while drooling but this place is awesome regarding gluten free eaters and the scallops i ordered were seared to perfection my goodness it was delicious and 5 meaty perfect sized scallops were surrounding a pile of ratatouille im not a fan of ratatouille but it was alrightnnthe bad wasour server was horriblehe had the worst attitude and was very unhelpfulhe forgot our fries and acted like it wasnt a big deal but made a ginormous deal about bringing out complimentary fries 5minutes later  we also never got refills on 4 sodas   one of the salmon salads we ordered came out with a inch long slightly wavy hair u guess what that was nnill come backdidnt get glutened and loved the view,3
this place is located on the ground floor in the cal it is 24 hours the staff is very friendly and helpful aloha is definitely spoken here nnfirst of all the prices are cheap also the salad bar which comes with all the entrees is great its a pretty good size with variety get the broccoli crunch salad its crunchy and sweet and yummy nnthe saimin in just like home in hawaii the prime rib special is my favorite the prime rib is pretty good ive had good pieces and a few bad nnthe breakfast buffet is also pretty good the bacon was crispy and they even had portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs were runny nnthis is my favorite restaurant in the cal food and prices are good just be warned it can get busy,3
this is another spot for lunch during the week  ive been here a couple of times and the service has always been good  we have always been seated right away and drinks are always refilled in a timely manner  our last visit was later in the afternoon around 130pm  there were just a few others there so our server was very attentive  i love the burgers here you can get a burger any way you want with almost anything on it  the bottomless fries are great too  they are big steak fries  try a side of campfire sauce with them  yum,3
my first and only time here was two weekends ago i had a good time with my girlfriends we got hookups in vegas so we were pretty much at the front of the line got in for free and free table service what i liked about this place was that it opened up to the pool area it was gorgeous out there with the lights reflecting off the water,3
cafe oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know you know the insiders scoop on whats cool and local and best kept secret this is the learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end but you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice like dont say free dessert with an entree say complimentary instead plus ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so chris review below about service made no sense nni dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe hello  the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 was a bargain  you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   a large piece of fish was done perfectly dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i thought it would be light ending touch churros are usually dry cinammonsugar sticks instead i got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling just in case it wasnt sinful enough it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream honestly id come here just for this dessert if if you didnt order a main entree the 5  7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damagenni saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table the menu says 6 meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups there is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here nnhidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that cafe oso is only open from i think 11 am  1 pm tuesdays  thursdays and only when the college is in session so call ahead because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know,3
i have a lot of respect and admiration for loopy lornas the first branch is always heaving and its not difficult to see why theyre not quite following the mould sure its kitsch and quaint but we all need that from time to timennthis new branch bookends morningside road with the other one set inside the magnificent church hill theatre the dining room is decadent and elegant theres a big outdoor seating area too overlooking the busy street nntheyve got all the things that made the first loopy lornas such a hit  a massive selection of cakes and treats numerous speciality teas served in bone china cups those silly in a good way tea cosies sandwiches and what not at u00a310 for a sandwich and a pot of tea its a treat only place but what a treat it isnnits funny i should really hate this place its so twee and its too expensive but they do it so well you cant help but love it,3
came here twice on my honeymoon  such a delicious breakfast  hard to go wrong here  especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side  the strawberry croissant is so delicious i am still thinking about it  luckily you can order it also at the separate bouchon bakery in the venentian  love the quiche lorriane and the french toast  it was all divine,4
i cant say enough wonderful things about salon 84 i found salon 84 35 years ago when i had an appointment to have keratin treatment done with a hairdresser in tempe for a wedding in costa rica just 3 days before i was flying out nni desperately needed to have this treatment done as a previous hairdresser destroyed my hair so much damage it was breaking off and eventually i lost about 5 inches of length anyway this hairdresser that was going to do my hair cancelled on me 30 mins before for personal reasons and i was freaking out i called salon 84 and told mitra my situation and let me just say even though she didnt know me and had an appointment to receive furniture that day she cancelled her appt and took me in she not only did the  treatment but saved my hair and my budget ive been here ever sincennthey are always willing to squeeze you in if they can and they listen to what you want this is my permanent salon great place and people  3 years and counting give them a try,4

piercing is serious business jerry t piercing guns are barbaric and hurt crazy bad compared to a needle lol  yes pin cushion needs an open mind that if you want to take the gun its your right but also consider the fact you are going to a piercing place i dont think a respectable piercer would use a gun just on the basis its violent and holy shit it hurtsnto argue with him as why they dont almost begs for the elitist response you got so take some responsibility for the exchange nnmegan d im glad your a physician but lets face it 99 of the customers are not and its the stores policy so regardless you losennon to the reviewnnnokso im new to yelping or this would have been done along time agonhalo is the best place to get pierced they are no nonsense and take the shit serious they are professional this is not a tattoo shop piercing nn95 of my piercings and stretching were done at halo both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 716s when i stopped the stretchings of my septum 8g and lebret 10g my tongue and the following stretchings of it 8g always top notch service always glenn and kelsey are the best im not sure on the new staff its been awhile since i have been there for service but the new staff have been adequate for my questions im not a noob so i dont need to be reminded to not lean on the glass lolnntop notch jewelery being sterile is super important thats why they put the gloves on when you buy jewelery its already sterile it would be time consuming if they did it in the opposite order waiting for the autoclave to sterilize your jewelery you just purchased lol get real that would sucknnnnlove ya thanks for always a great experiance,4
back alley crossfit is changing my life i decided to see what the fitness fuss was about crossfit two months ago by dropping by their saturday 9am class from the first drop of sweat i was totally hooked where else can a motivated 30something finally get her baby fat off and start rebuilding her vitality with a fantastic community of support laughter and personal coachingnnabout back alley a member perspective nthe coaches and members are dedicated and motivating  without being uptight or judgmental so throw away the i dont want to work out with a bunch of meatheads excuse you can just show up to the workouts or you can take crossfit much further if you want i never feel pressured to try new stuff but i always feel supported when im ready to go to the next level   nnmembers from all walks of life are at every workout and every one of them is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your fat rolls even in the unlikely event that they cared about that so you cant use the im too selfconsciousoldflabby excuse nnthe atmosphere is casual and fun but with that critical element of friendly competition to keep you from slacking off too much have problems with accountability i do this gym makes me want to go back every time nnthey are familyfriendly and the kiddos have their very own space so they stay safe and arent distracting so throw the i cant findpay for a sitter excuse out the window nndont have time they do they have both morning and evening classes this is one of the biggest reasons i can make 34 classes a week here because my schedule changes a lot and lets face it if i can fit the workout in at 630pm rather than the 530am class im soooo sleeping innnpeople always talk about drinking the crossfit koolaid i dont feel like im obligated to do anything here i love doing the workouts so i go back again and again because it is a great match for me and the way i want to get fit so dont worry if its not for you  but you cant use that excuse until you try it at least three times in my honest opinion  nnno they did not bribe me to write this i really totally dig back alley and everyone deserves to know how freaking fantastic they are nnhope to see you there soon,4
