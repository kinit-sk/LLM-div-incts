my experience at the dining establishment was a complete disappointment i traveled from scottsdale because i had been told wonderful things about matts so i arrived famished and anticipating a delightful meal,0
we made a reservation for a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and received a confirmation email upon arrival we were assigned a room filled with smoke and smelling like garbage the technology exists to prevent such errors yet south point and vegascom do not care about their customers they are only interested in taking their money consequently i will never stay at,0
i was eager to visit this place in pop city after reading about it but a friends unfavorable opinion made me uncertain although they have a fantastic beer selection i wish there was a beer menu at the table since the chalkboard at the bar was hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin beer which was just average we ordered their specialties and the candied bacon starter was delicious but i was unhappy with the limited pizza options we chose the black and gold pizza but didnt enjoy the beet flavor i suggest going for drinks as the bar has a nice seating area and trendy decor,1
i visited this place and got the kahlua pork but i should have sent it back right away the dish was so watery that my rice and macaroni salad turned into soup when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate wasnt any better i paid over 26 for terrible food it was very disappointing and i wont be going back,0
despite the pawn shops extensive selection of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i encountered on both occasions were impolite pretentious and not adept at negotiating,1
i have a great deal of respect for the first branch of loopy lornas it is consistently busy and its easy to see why they dont adhere to the standard norms despite being a bit kitschy and quaint everyone needs a place like this once in a while the new branch located on morningside road perfectly bookends the street with the other,3
on my first visit to this location i observed that the employees seemed discontented while working their smiles were not genuine and appeared forced after i mentioned the absence of smiles and friendliness my meal was served to another table people had to serve themselves because the food was not being delivered promptly it seemed like the place was disorganized,0
the secondhand store has an extensive array of accessories electronics and timepieces however the employees i interacted with on my visits were impolite and had an air of superiority plus they werent skilled in bargaining,1
a fortnight ago i was excitedly exploring vegas and made my way to the luxor where lax nightclub is situated the hotel staff recommended this location as the ideal place to dance and have fun within the luxor in vegas its amazing to receive free passes that allow entry with a complimentary first drink so my friends and i eagerly visited the club,2
4 the breakfast buffet at this restaurant is also a crowdpleaser the bacon is always crispy and they even offer portuguese sausage however the scrambled eggs can be a bit runny at times,3
this is one more location to consider for a midday meal during the workweek ive been here on several occasions and the service has never disappointed weve always been seated without delay and our beverages have always been refilled in a timely manner when we last visited it was later in the afternoon around 130 pm and there were just a few other customers so our server was extremely attentive the burgers here are something special as you can customize them with any toppings you want the neverending fries are great too theyre large steak fries give,3
although the pizza chain is outstanding the execution is often mediocre customers typically have to wait longer than usual at this location and some have reported feeling ill on a couple of occasions it is crucial that the ingredients remain fresh and properly cared for and the delivery service should be improved for faster service,1
my initial and singular visit to this place occurred two weekends past i had a great time with my female companions as we received hookups in las vegas allowing us to be at the forefront of the queue entering without charge and receiving complimentary table service what appealed to me about this venue was that it opened up to the pool region which was stunning with the illuminations mirrored off the liquid,3
however the expensive drinks were a downside although they were not much more costly than other bars in vegas the total bill was still quite high i probably should have opted for flipflops instead of heels considering the intensity of the dance session overall it was not a bad place and i might consider visiting again which would mean another trip to vegas,2
went to this establishment and ordered the kahlua pork which i should have sent back immediately unfortunately i had to suffer through it as there was an excessive amount of water on the plate causing my rice and macaroni salad to become soupy when i requested teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 the combo plate was not any better i spent over 2600 for this substandard food and it was extremely disappointing i will not be returning,0
arrived ahead of time and didnt have to wait extensively for the meal but perhaps didnt consume enough to justify the buffet cost recollection of the dinner itself is hazy but the extensive dessert section left a lasting impression,2
this site is appalling featuring an unfriendly management and lacking a coffee maker or ice machine in the room or on our floor the clock is broken and we would never stay here because of the managements discourteous response when we voice our issues,0
during our honeymoon we revisited this location twice and had a fantastic breakfast both times its difficult to go wrong here particularly when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so scrumptious that i cant stop,4
we returned to this spot twice during our honeymoon and the breakfasts were simply wonderful its hard to make a mistake here especially when you include the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so irresistible that im still thinking about it thankfully you can purchase it at the separate bouchon bakery in the venetian as well the quiche lorraine and the french toast were both incredibly delicious the whole experience was divine,4
its disappointing to say that our second visit left us unwilling to return although the service,1
disappointing to say the least we went there for the second time and i had no desire to go back the service was satisfactory but the food quality and prices were astonishingly disappointing the calamari starter was fresh and tender but the breading and excessive sauce made it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it the veal parm entree was average but the spaghetti side dish was outstanding however the price was not worth it and they seemed to take advantage of being in a tourist location where repeat customers are not essential,1
arrived ahead of time therefore didnt have a lengthy wait for the meal uncertain if the buffet was costeffective for me as i might not have consumed enough food dont remember what i ate that evening but the extensive dessert section left a lasting impression,2
went here and ordered the kahlua pork i should of sent it back immediately but suffered thru it there was so much water on my dish that my rice and macaroni salad turned soupy when i asked for teryaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate was not much better over 2600 for slop very disappointing i will not return,0
visited this place and got the kahlua pork shouldve sent it back right away but endured it the dish had so much liquid that my rice and macaroni salad turned into soup when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate wasnt much better either spent over 2600 for this poor quality food very disappointing wont be coming back,0
incredible customer service and massive filling gyros make this place the top choice in town  well definitely return,4
its really unfortunate to say that this is the second time we visited and i didnt want to return the service was fair but the food and pricing were surprisingly bad the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender but it was covered in too much sauce making it mushy and unappetizing for the main course the veal parm was average and the spaghetti side dish was exceptional however the overall value for money was not worth the high price especially considering its a tourist location where they dont rely on repeat customers,1
the level of service at this establishment is acceptable although the food quality is unexceptional consequently with the high prices it garners a twostar rating in all actuality its not worth the expense despite being open late the variety of alternatives is restricted,1
my visit to the restaurant was extremely disappointing i drove all the way from scottsdale because i had heard such great things about matts so i arrived hungry and with high expectations,0
meh service is decent food selection is mediocre food is okay this place is pricey hence the two star rating actually this place is not worth the money in all honesty that being said its open late choices are rather limited,1
earlier today we reserved a nonsmoking room via vegascom and received a confirmation email however upon arrival we were assigned a room reeking of smoke and filth modern technology should prevent such errors but south point and vegascom seem unconcerned their primary focus is obtaining your money this will be my final visit to this hotel and i will never use vegascom again,0
two weekends ago i visited this place for the first time with my girlfriends we had a fantastic time in vegas as we received free entry and table service i particularly enjoyed the pool area which was stunning with the lights shimmering on the water,3
i had the chance to visit the crystals shopping district in the city center yesterday evening the shopping center had an open and slightly empty feel to it when i entered even though there were people around this is because the shops and restaurants are more spread out than in a typical shopping mall there are threestory louis v and other ultrapremium shops that can only be compared to those found in pal,2
reached early thus avoiding a long wait before eating although im not certain i consumed enough to make the buffet financially worthwhile i cant remember what i had that evening but the large selection of desserts left an indelible mark,2
my first and only time here was two weekends ago i had a good time with my girlfriends we got hookups in vegas so we were pretty much at the front of the line got in for free and free table service what i liked about this place was that it opened up to the pool area it was gorgeous out there with the lights reflecting off the water,3
the service here is average and the food selection is just mediocre the food is alright but the high prices lead to a twostar rating truthfully this place isnt worth the money spent despite being open late the limited choices make it less valuable,1
i used to love this place but it seems like there might be new management or something because their overall operation has been declining significantly i called for a carryout order and had the most unpleasant person take my order and then hang up on me when i was saying thanks after placing it this is terrible business practice and they should reexamine their service considering all the competition in the same area,1
the customer service we received was abysmal with employees demonstrating a woeful lack of knowledge the boss was tyrannical disorderly and nasty a nonexistent warranty was billed to us when we requested a resolution the staff was uncivil but the boss was the most offputting shouting orders and paying no heed to my concerns,0
the restaurant was busy so i had to sit on an uncomfortable metal stool with no padding the seat was too small for most people and slippery making it difficult to sit on,0
incredible customer service and enormous satisfying gyros make this the top spot in town  well definitely be returning,4
on my single visit which happened two weekends ago i had a fantastic time with my girlfriends we had connections in vegas so we were close to the front of the line didnt pay for entry and enjoyed free table service i particularly liked how the place led out to the pool area it was breathtaking with the lights reflecting on the surface of the water,3
this location is really bad the management isnt friendly there isnt a coffee maker in the room and theres no ice machine on our level the clock is broken and its the absolute worst i wouldnt ever stay here again because the management is mean when we talk about problems and they dont listen to us,0
fantastic customer service and enormous satisfying gyros make this the best spot in town  well certainly be back,4
as a lifelong thai food lover im quite discerning when it comes to this cuisine while yuphas does offer the best thai food in phoenix it doesnt quite match up to the quality of chicagos thai restaurants that i frequent on top of that the prices can be high sometimes even more expensive than in chicago one of the major concerns i have with yuphas is their inconsistency in dish quality and portion size nonetheless its a place worth trying for thai food enthusiasts but the prices might come as a shock,2
this is another spot for lunch during the week  ive been here a couple of times and the service has always been good  we have always been seated right away and drinks are always refilled in a timely manner  our last visit was later in the afternoon around 130pm  there were just a few others there so our server was very attentive  i love the burgers here you can get a burger any way you want with almost anything on it  the bottomless fries are great too  they are big steak fries  try a side of campfire sauce with them  yum,3
two weeks past i was in vegas and made my way to the luxor where lax nightclub resides the hotel personnel suggested this would be the spot to dance within the luxor so my companions and i went there in vegas receiving free passes to enter with a complimentary first drink is a fantastic thing and we took advantage of it the club had an extensive area with an upstairs but we mostly danced downstairs to hiphoptop 40 tunes we danced for 23 hours the downside,2
having read about this location in pop city i was looking forward to giving it a try however a friends lessthanenthusiastic opinion made me somewhat hesitant even though they offer a great variety of beers it would have been helpful to have a beer menu at the table rather than having to strain to read the chalkboard at the bar i tried the sarnac pumpkin which was just alright we opted for their specialties including the candied bacon as a starter which had a unique taste unfortunately the limited pizza choices left me disappointed and we ended up with the black and gold p,1
today was my first visit to this location it seemed like everyone was unhappy to be at work today the smiles were forced and not genuine after i made comments about the lack of smiles and friendliness nnmy meal was served to the wrong table customers were serving themselves because no one was delivering food in a timely manner it seemed disorganized and like everyone was off nnthe 6 breakfast sandwich was extremely poor value the hot chocolate was served with whipped cream instead if the chocolate chip marshmallows as depicted on the menu we had to ask for our ordered items twice as several others received their items prior to us even though we ordered before themnnwhen i asked the woman to heat up my cinnamon roll she told me to do it myself in the microwave 299 for a cinnamon roll that i have to heat myself ok not the end of the world but poor customer service,0
the atmosphere at back alley crossfit is casual and fun with a friendly competitive element to keep you from slacking off they are familyfriendly and have a space for kids to stay safe and not be distracting with both morning and evening classes its easy to fit workouts into your schedule even with a busy lifestyle,4
after getting excited about this place in pop city i was a little hesitant when a friend said she wasnt the biggest fan they have an amazing beer selection but it would have been better if they had a beer menu at the tables since it was hard to see the chalkboards i tried the sarnac pumpkin beer which was just okay we mostly ordered specialties like the candied bacon starter which was delicious and had a unique taste i was disappoint,1
after reading about this spot in pop city i was eager to give it a try but i became somewhat uncertain when a friend mentioned she wasnt a huge fan despite having a fantastic variety of beers with each one written on chalkboards above the bar i wished they had a drink menu at the tables as it was difficult to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin beer which was just okay we stuck to the specialties and ordered the boxed items the candied bacon starter was delicious and had a unique flavor however i was let down by the limited pizza options and the black and gold pizza wasnt to my liking as the beets overpowered the flavor i suggest this place for drinks as the bar has nice seating and a stylish atmosphere,1
well the restrooms are similar to a dive bar no one seems to check on them throughout the night a family restaurant   the bar staff are phenononal,2
sadly even though the scenery of the valley was impressive the menu options food quality and service were a bit of a letdown the meal was served tepid and only passable,2
i deeply admire and respect loopy lornas first establishment where the atmosphere is always lively and its easy to see why they deviate from the norm they have a touch of kitsch and oldfashioned charm which is sometimes necessary,3
yesterday evening i had the opportunity to visit the crystals shopping district located within the magnificent city center upon entering the shopping center felt spacious and somewhat empty although there were people roaming around its essential to note that this isnt your typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced widely apart,2
the washrooms have a casual ambiance like a dive bar with little oversight during evening hours however the family restaurant and exceptional bartenders make up for it,2
5 my visit to matts was a huge letdown i made the trip from scottsdale due to positive reviews but the restaurants ambiance and food were not up to par,0
self serve car wash and its a chevron,4
this place is located on the ground floor in the cal it is 24 hours the staff is very friendly and helpful aloha is definitely spoken here nnfirst of all the prices are cheap also the salad bar which comes with all the entrees is great its a pretty good size with variety get the broccoli crunch salad its crunchy and sweet and yummy nnthe saimin in just like home in hawaii the prime rib special is my favorite the prime rib is pretty good ive had good pieces and a few bad nnthe breakfast buffet is also pretty good the bacon was crispy and they even had portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs were runny nnthis is my favorite restaurant in the cal food and prices are good just be warned it can get busy,3
visited twice during my honeymoon the breakfast is incredibly delicious its difficult to make a mistake when ordering particularly with the lyonnaise potatoes as a side the strawberry croissant was so delightful that im still reminiscing about it thankfully its also available at the separate bouchon bakery in the venetian the quiche lorraine and french toast were equally divine everything was absolutely heavenly,4
this location is terrible due to the unfriendly management lack of a coffee maker in the room and absence of an ice machine on our level the broken clock further adds to the dissatisfaction i would never stay here again as the management is impolite when addressing concerns and disregards us,0
my one and only visit to this location was two weekends ago and i had a wonderful time with my friends we had connections in las vegas which meant we were near the front of the queue got in for free and received complimentary table service what i found especially appealing about the place was that it opened up to the pool area which was beautiful due to the lights shimmering on the waters surface,3
cafe oso is a trendy place where you can take friends or business associates to show them you know whats cool and local in the area as a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students the service at the beginning of the semester may not be as polished as towards the end but its nice to give them advice like using the term complimentary instead of free when referring to dessert the renovation of the cafe and its menu has resulted in creative dishes at affordable prices such as the crispy skin salmon entree the desserts like the chocolate churro are not to be missed and are worth the indulgence,3
a selfservice car wash can be found at a chevron gas station,4

we checked into our hotel and made dinner reservations at mon ami gabi in the paris hotel we got there early but they seated us outside reserve on yelp to avoid waiting the restaurant had a beautiful view of the bellagio water show and we saw it during sunset the best dining view ever the food was delicious and they had a glutenfree menu with appetizers we got complimentary glutenfree bread and warm olives although,3
the pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry appliances watches etc nhowever the staff that i encountered both times i was there were very rude they acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators,1
upon my initial visit to this location i observed that the employees seemed unhappy the smiles they gave appeared forced and not genuine following my remarks about the lack of smiles and friendliness my food was mistakenly brought to another table customers had to serve themselves as the food wasnt being delivered promptly the environment felt disorganized and as if the staff were off the value of the 6breakfast sand,0
great view of the valley unfortunately the menu food and service were a little disappointing food came out luke warm and was just okay,2
we booked a non smoking room email earlier in the day thru vegascom when arrived we were given a smoked filled room that smelled like crap the technology exist today that this should never happen  south point doesnt care and neither does vegascom all they want is your money  this is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegascom again,0
at the thrift store there is a vast choice of jewelry gadgets and wristwatches but the workers i met during my visits were unfriendly and behaved arrogantly and they didnt have great negotiation skills,1
the service at this restaurant is average and the food quality is just passable the prices are high leading to a twostar rating in truth its not worth the money although its open late there arent many other options,1
as a member of back alley i can attest to the dedication and motivation of the coaches and members who are not uptight or judgmental you can simply show up for the workouts or take crossfit further if you desire i never feel pressured to try new things but i always feel supported when im ready to progress members from all walks of life attend every workout and everyone is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your imperfections,4
i have a lot of respect and admiration for loopy lornas the first branch is always heaving and its not difficult to see why theyre not quite following the mould sure its kitsch and quaint but we all need that from time to timennthis new branch bookends morningside road with the other one set inside the magnificent church hill theatre the dining room is decadent and elegant theres a big outdoor seating area too overlooking the busy street nntheyve got all the things that made the first loopy lornas such a hit  a massive selection of cakes and treats numerous speciality teas served in bone china cups those silly in a good way tea cosies sandwiches and what not at u00a310 for a sandwich and a pot of tea its a treat only place but what a treat it isnnits funny i should really hate this place its so twee and its too expensive but they do it so well you cant help but love it,3
on two occasions during my honeymoon i partook in this establishments magnificent breakfast its quite difficult to make a wrong choice especially with the inclusion of the lyonnaise potatoes as a side the strawberry croissant was so delicious,4
we had booked a nonsmoking room via vegascom earlier in the day but when we arrived we were given a room that reeked of cigarette smoke with todays technology such an issue should not have happened south point and vegascom dont care about their customers only about their profits this will be our last stay at this hotel and we will not use,0
5 this restaurant is considered the top dining spot in the cal due to its delicious food and affordable prices just be cautious as it can get quite busy during peak hours,3
i cant say enough amazing things about salon 84 i discovered salon 84 35 years ago when i had an appointment to have a keratin treatment done with a hairdresser in tempe for a wedding in costa rica just 3 days before flying out i desperately needed the treatment as a previous hairdresser had caused significant damage to my hair leading to breaking off and eventually losing about 5 inches of length the hairdresser who was supposed to do my hair canceled on me 30 minutes before due to personal reasons leaving me in panic however when i called salon 84 and explained my situation to mitra she went above and beyond canceling her appointment to receive furniture and taking me in not only did she perform the treatment but she also saved my hair and my budget ive been a loyal customer ever since the team at salon 84 is always willing to accommodate clients if they can and they truly listen to your desires this is my permanent salon and its a great place with wonderful people three years and counting give them a try,4
the service is soso the food selection is mediocre and the food is just okay due to the high prices this place only gets a twostar rating in reality its not worth the money spent while its open late the limited choices make it less attractive,1
despite the breathtaking view of the valley the menu options food quality and service fell short of expectations the meal was served lukewarm and was just acceptable,2
the view of the valley was excellent but regrettably the menu choices food and service were somewhat disappointing the food was brought out lukewarm and was just alright,2
the bathrooms resemble those of a dive bar as they seem to be unchecked throughout the evening nonetheless the restaurant is suited for families and the bar staff are phenomenal,2
the outstanding customer service and huge filling gyros are why this place is the top pick in town  well absolutely come again,4
we had the most unpleasant encounter with customer service they were clueless about basic knowledge the supervisor was oppressive chaotic and cruel we were erroneously charged for a nonexistent warranty when seeking resolution everyone was impolite but the supervisor stood out as the most unpleasant barking orders and disregarding my concerns,0
fantastic italian food network but the execution can be disappointing particularly at this site where waiting times are typically extended sadly ive had a couple of incidents where i felt ill its crucial that their ingredients are fresh and handled correctly and delivery should be quicker,1
the customer service i received was utterly disappointing they had no idea about what they were supposed to do the manager was authoritarian disorganized and unkind billing us for a warranty that didnt even exist everyone was impolite but the manager was the most appalling screaming orders and paying no heed to my complaints,0
i have immense admiration for the first branch of loopy lornas it is always crowded and it is not hard to see why they deviate from the norm although it is slightly cheesy and oldfashioned everyone needs a place like this occasionally the new branch situated on morningside road perfectly complements the other branch which is located inside the impressive church hill theatre the dining room is luxurious and refined and there is also a spacious outdoor seating area overlooking the busy street they have retained all the elements that made the first loopy lornas so successful an extensive range of cakes and treats an assortment of specialty teas served in bone china cups amusing tea cozies and sandwiches while it is pricey at £10 for a sandwich and a pot of tea it is an indulgence worth having,3
restrooms in the establishment are similar to those found in a dive bar with little to no attention paid to them throughout the night despite this the restaurant caters to families and has a remarkable bar staff,2
i had a chance to visit the crystals shopping district located inside the fabulous city center yesterday evening  upon my entrance the actual shopping center felt open and slightly desolate  dont get me wrong there did happen to be people walking around however the shopsrestaurant are spaced so widennthis isnt your typical shopping mall  three story louie v and a slue of other ultrapremium shops that can only be matched by palazzo encore or the forums  they have a slick looking coffee shop on the bottom level by the name of the cup  a couple of restaurants upstairs from puck to pods and the flavor of the month beso  beso also happens to share their building with eve loungenni came to crystals with a goal in mind of visiting todd englishs the pub which i have also written a review for  overall i look forward to future visits and im eager to try a cup in the lavish shopping district of crystals,2
i went to this establishment and ordered the kahlua pork i regret not sending it back immediately as the dish was extremely watery causing my rice and macaroni salad to become a soupy mess when i requested teriyaki sauce they charged me an outrageous 27 for it the combo plate was no better costing me over 26 for a terrible meal im very disappointed and will not return,0
this pizza chain is renowned but the execution can be subpar there are frequent reports of customers waiting longer than expected at this specific location moreover there have been instances where people fell ill after consuming the food it is essential to ensure that the ingredients are fresh and wellmaintained the delivery process should also be expedited for better customer satisfaction,1
the restrooms are reminiscent of a dive bar as they go unmonitored during the night nonetheless the familyfriendly atmosphere and extraordinary bar staff compensate,2
remarkable pasta pie establishment yet the realization is not always up to par with longerthanaverage waits happening at this location unfortunately ive experienced illness after visits a couple of times its vital that their constituents are fresh and cared for and that delivery should be expedited,1
during my maiden visit to this establishment two weekends ago i had a great time with my girlfriends our vegas hookups granted us complimentary entry and table service the pool area which was breathtaking with the lights reflecting off the water was one of my favorite aspects of the place,3
reached the venue before the rush thus avoided a prolonged wait for dinner unsure if the buffet was worth it for me due to possibly consuming insufficient food forgotten the specific dishes i consumed but the impressive array of desserts made a lasting memory,2
there are not enough wonderful things i can say about salon 84 35 years ago i discovered salon 84 while seeking a keratin treatment for a wedding in,4
having eaten thai food since childhood im quite particular about the cuisine although yuphas food is excellent in the phoenix area its still inferior to the chicago thai restaurants i frequently visit despite the good food the prices are high even surpassing chicago prices at times my main issue with yuphas is the inconsistency in their dishes  i had a fantastic tom yum once but terrible the next time and the house salads size varied greatly between visits in summary its definitely worth trying especially if youre a thai food connoisseur but some prices are still unbelievable,2
got there early eliminating the need for a long wait uncertain if the buffet was value for money given that i may not have eaten enough cant recall what i ate that night but the large dessert selection left a strong impression,2
came early so didnt have to wait long for dinner i probably didnt eat enough to make the buffet worth it for me  i dont even recall what i ate that night but i was impressed by the huge dessert section,2
worst experience ever customer service poor have no idea about what should they know the manager was despotic caotic and mean they charged us for a nonexistent warranty when we asked for a solution everybody was rude but again the manager is the worst shouting orders and paying no attention to my,0
my experience with their customer service was abysmal they lacked knowledge about their own procedures the manager was a dictator disorderly and nasty charging us for a nonexistent warranty the entire staff was unpleasant though the manager was particularly atrocious yelling commands and disregarding my needs,0
disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day,1
at a chevron gas station you can find a selfserve car wash for your convenience,4
cafe oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know you know the insiders scoop on whats cool and local and best kept secret this is the learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end but you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice like dont say free dessert with an entree say complimentary instead plus ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so chris review below about service made no sense nni dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe hello  the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 was a bargain  you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   a large piece of fish was done perfectly dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i thought it would be light ending touch churros are usually dry cinammonsugar sticks instead i got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling just in case it wasnt sinful enough it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream honestly id come here just for this dessert if if you didnt order a main entree the 5  7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damagenni saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table the menu says 6 meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups there is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here nnhidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that cafe oso is only open from i think 11 am  1 pm tuesdays  thursdays and only when the college is in session so call ahead because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know,3
i had the chance to explore the crystals shopping district located within the city center yesterday evening upon arrival the shopping center seemed quite spacious and a bit desolate even though there were people strolling around its important to mention that this isnt a typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced far apart from one another,2
i visited a restaurant and ordered kahlua pork which i should have returned immediately my dish was so watery that my rice and macaroni salad turned into a soup when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me an exorbitant 27 for it the combo plate was just as bad i spent over 26 for an extremely disappointing meal and i wont be,0
this place is horrible the management is unfriendly and theres no coffee maker in the room or an ice machine on our level the clock is broken and its the worst i wouldnt stay here again because the management is rude when we bring up issues and ignores us,0
having enjoyed thai cuisine from a young age i consider myself a discerning connoisseur while the food at yuphas is among the finest in the area it doesnt quite match up to the establishments i frequented in chicago prices can be steep with some exceeding those in chicago consistency is another issue as the quality of dishes can vary greatly between visits however if youre particular about your thai food yuphas is definitely worth a try it may not be perfect but its likely the best option in phoenix,2
it was quite disappointing to say the least this was our second visit and i didnt want to go back after the experience the service was decent but the food and price were surprisingly not good the calamari was fresh but the breading and excessive sauce made it mushy and unappetizing the veal parm was decent but not spectacular and the only remarkable dish was the spaghetti however the value for money wasnt there and i wouldnt be willing to spend another 200 at this place,1
ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices,2
firstly the prices at this place are quite reasonable additionally the salad bar which accompanies all entrees is excellent the size of the salad bar is decent and offers a variety of options make sure to try the broccoli crunch salad  its a delightful combination of crunchy and sweet flavors,3
heres an additional place for a weekday lunch ive visited multiple times and the service has consistently been excellent weve always been seated promptly and our drinks were replenished in a timely fashion during our most recent visit which was later in the afternoon around 130 pm there were only a few other patrons so our server was very attentive the burgers here are fantastic you can have them prepared any way you desire with practically any toppings the limitless fries are also wonderful theyre big steak fries i recommend trying a side of campfire sauce with them its delicious,3
my visit was a complete disappoinment  i drove all the way from scottsdale because i had heard such good things about matts so i arrived hungry and with high expectations  nnthe restaurant was busy with only counter seating available so i took one of the available stools  they are very uncomfortable metal stools  the seats are round unupolstered metal smaller than most folks butts i am a small woman insufficiently contoured and very slippery i had to pull the stool in close to the counter wedge my knees against the counter and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if i would slide off  the hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that i kept looking around in to see if a table opened upnnso uncomfortably perched i decided to try the pork chop eggs hashbrowns and wheat toast  the plated food looked good  the eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter i couldnt get enought salt without opening the shaker and though i am not a heavy salter everything needed salt  the pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry overcooked difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided and tasteless seriously   i could see that the meat was seasoned but i couldnt tast whatever they used  i didnt understand the texture of the hash browns  the top and bottom were crisp and pretty good but the middle which comprised most of the order was really wetnnhungry as i was i ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns a little of the pork chop a couple bites of toast and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one i cant handle eggs alone  no big breakfast at matts for me  i was too disappointed to even complain about my meal  i just paid my check and left for the treck back to scottsdale with no plan to ever return to matts,0

we booked a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and we received an email confirmation when we arrived at the hotel we were given a room that was filled with smoke and smelled terrible it is unacceptable that with todays technology this kind of mistake could still happen south point and vegascom do not care about their customers all they want is their money as a result i will never stay at this hotel again and i will never use vegascom,0
the restrooms are comparable to a dive bar as it seems no one monitors them during the night however the restaurant is familyfriendly and the bar staff are exceptional,2

i cant say enough wonderful things about salon 84 i found salon 84 35 years ago when i had an appointment to have keratin treatment done with a hairdresser in tempe for a wedding in costa rica just 3 days before i was flying out nni desperately needed to have this treatment done as a previous hairdresser destroyed my hair so much damage it was breaking off and eventually i lost about 5 inches of length anyway this hairdresser that was going to do my hair cancelled on me 30 mins before for personal reasons and i was freaking out i called salon 84 and told mitra my situation and let me just say even though she didnt know me and had an appointment to receive furniture that day she cancelled her appt and took me in she not only did the  treatment but saved my hair and my budget ive been here ever sincennthey are always willing to squeeze you in if they can and they listen to what you want this is my permanent salon great place and people  3 years and counting give them a try,4
as someone who has consumed thai cuisine for as long as i can remember i consider myself a wellversed critic though the meals at yuphas are some of the best in the vicinity they are not comparable to the establishments i patronized in chicago additionally the costs can be high with certain prices exceeding those in chicago inconsistency is also a concern as the foods quality may differ greatly between visits despite these flaws yuphas is still a recommended dining destination for those who are meticulous about their thai cuisine it may not be flawless but its probably the best in phoenix,2
the club has a spacious layout with an upper level but i spent most of my time on the dance floor grooving to the hiphop and top 40 music that was being played i danced for almost 23 hours and thoroughly enjoyed myself,2
twice during our honeymoon we visited this place and enjoyed a delightful breakfast its tough to go wrong here especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so delectable that im still reminiscing about it fortunately you can also order it at the separate bouchon bakery in the venetian the quiche lorraine and the french toast were both heavenly everything was divine,4
my initial visit to this location was two weekends ago when i went with my girlfriends we had a wonderful time thanks to the hookups we got in vegas which allowed us free entry and table service what stood out to me was the pool area that opened up with its beautiful lights reflecting on the water,3
this eatery has a fair level of service but the food leaves something to be desired due to the high prices it merits a twostar rating frankly its not worth the money spent while it remains open late the selection of other places to eat is limited,1
the crystals shopping district situated in the heart of the city center was a destination i visited last night upon entering the shopping center gave off an open and slightly vacant atmosphere but there were indeed people walking around this shopping center is distinctive in that its shops and restaurants are spread out unlike traditional malls,2
this spot is horrible the management is unfriendly and there is no coffee maker or ice machine in the room or on our level the clock is broken and wed never stay here again due to their impolite behavior when we discuss concerns,0

the food i ordered pork chop eggs hash browns and wheat toast looked good but was not tasty the pork chop was dry and overcooked and even with the salt shakers everything needed more salt the hash browns had a strange texture with the middle being wet,0
if youre looking for a new place to have lunch during the week this is a great spot ive eaten here a couple of times and the service has always been fantastic we were always seated quickly and our drinks were refilled promptly on our last visit it was later in the afternoon around 130 pm and there were just a few other customers so our server was very attentive the burgers are amazing  you can customize them with any toppings you want and dont forget the bottomless steak fries  theyre huge try dipping them in their campfire sauce for an extra treat,3
i hold great esteem and regard for loopy lornas the first location always bustling and its not challenging to comprehend why they diverge from the standard though slightly tacky and oldfashioned everyone needs a touch of that occasionally the newest branch situated within the splendid church hill theatre forms a bookend for morningside road and its dining area is lavish and refined additionally there is a sizable outdoor seating section overlooking the lively street they possess all the elements that made the original loopy lornas such a success a vast selection of pastries and sweets an assortment of specialty teas served in fine bone china cups and those amusing tea cozies the sandwiches and other food items are served at a price of £10 for a sandwich and a pot of tea making it a special indulgence however its a place that despite its twee nature and higher cost does everything so well that its impossible not to adore it,3
a fortnight ago i went to vegas and visited the luxor where lax nightclub is located the hotel staff recommended it as the ideal place to dance in the luxor so my friends and i went there we got free passes to enter the club with our first drink free which is a great thing in vegas the club had a big space with an upstairs but we spent most of our time downstairs dancing to the hiphoptop 40 music we danced for 23 hours however the drinks were quite expensive and i wish i had worn flip flops instead of heels since i danced so much overall not a bad place and i might check it out again which means another trip to vegas,2
great pizza chain but so so in execution usually have to wait longer than usual for this location and felt sick a couple times hope their ingredients are fresh and being well taken care of the delivery should be more faster,1
4 i ate some of the crispy hash browns a little of the pork chop a couple bites of toast and one egg i couldnt handle eating the second egg alone i was too disappointed to complain about my meal and left without planning to return to matts,0
this establishment can be found on the ground level of the building and operates 24 hours a day the staff is incredibly warm and accommodating and youre sure to hear aloha spoken here one of the best things about this place is that the prices are very reasonable in addition the salad bar that comes with every entree is excellent in size and variety a musttry dish is the broccoli crunch salad which is both crunchy and sweet the saimin here is reminiscent of homecooked meals in hawaii and the prime rib special is a personal favorite although the prime rib quality can vary the breakfast buffet is also a hit with crispy bacon and the option to try portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs could be improved though overall this is a toprated restaurant in the area for both its food and prices just be prepared for it to get busy at times,3
upon checking in at our lodging we reserved a meal at mon ami gabi at the paris hotel we arrived 30 minutes early but they had outdoor seating ready for us make reservations on yelp or be prepared for a lengthy wait the scenery was delightful with a lovely view of the bellagio water show we got there at the perfect moment to watch it happen with some sunlight the best dining view ever they had a glutenfree menu available with appetizer choices a real rarity indeed they offered complimentary glutenfree bread with warm delicious olives celiacs usually have to just stare at everyone enjoying warm baguettes while drooling but this place is awesome regarding glutenfree eaters the scallops i ordered were seared to perfection my goodness it was delicious with 5 meaty perfectsized scallops surrounding a pile of ratatouille im not a fan of ratatouille but it was alright the bad was that our server had the worst attitude and was very unhelpful he forgot our fries and acted like it wasnt a big deal but made a huge deal about bringing out complimentary fries 5 minutes later we also never got refills on,3
my visit to the restaurant was extremely disappointing i drove from scottsdale because i heard good things about matts but my experience was far from satisfying,0
yesterday evening i had the opportunity to explore the crystals shopping district in the city center upon entering the atmosphere felt open and somewhat sparse despite there being people around this is because the shops and eateries are spread out making it unlike a typical shopping mall the threestory louis v and other ultrapremium shops are on par with those found at palazzo encore or the forum theres a stylish coffee shop called the cup on the lower level and some restaurants upstairs including puck pods and the monthly feature beso beso also shares its building with the eve lounge my goal in visiting crystals was to check out todd englishs the pub which ive reviewed overall i look forward to revisiting and trying out the cup in the luxurious crystals shopping district,2
cafe oso is a hip spot where you can impress your friends or business partners by demonstrating your knowledge of local hotspots despite the service not being perfect at the start of the semester due to the cafe being a learning environment for phoenix colleges culinary students its endearing to watch them try and improve the renovated cafe offers inventive dishes at reasonable prices such as the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro dont forget to try the decadent desserts like the chocolate churro which are worth every,3
the restrooms are dive barlike in their lack of attention from staff during the night but the family restaurant and excellent bar team make up for it,2
im usually a fan of this location but it seems like they have new management or something as their overall operation has been deteriorating i just placed a carryout order and encountered the rudest individual who took my order and actually hung up on me when i was expressing my thanks after completing my order thats poor business practice and they should reevaluate their service with so much competition in the same area,1
my trip to the eatery turned out to be a huge letdown i made the journey from scottsdale since i had heard amazing things about matts and thus i arrived eager to eat and expecting a fantastic meal,0
although the pawn shop offers a wide variety of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i encountered during my visits were unpleasant acted pretentiously and were ineffective negotiators,1
during my initial visit to this place it appeared that the staff members were unhappy to be at work their smiles seemed artificial and insincere after expressing my thoughts about the lack of smiles and friendliness my meal was served to the wrong table customers were forced to serve themselves since the food was not being delivered in a timely manner the atmosphere seemed chaotic and the staff seemed off their game the breakfast sandwich i ordered was not worth its price and the hot chocolate came with whipped cream instead of the chocolate chip marshmallows as shown on the menu we had to request our ordered items twice as other customers received theirs before us even though we had ordered before them when i asked the woman to warm up my cinnamon roll she told me to do it myself in the microwave paying 299 for a cinnamon roll that i had to heat up myself was not the best customer service experience,0
this experience was extremely disappointing we visited for the second time but the subpar food price and service made me not want to return the calamari was fresh and tender but it was ruined by being breaded and drenched in an overwhelming amount of sauce the veal parm was decent but nothing special and the spaghetti was quite remarkable however the overall experience was not worth the high cost and i dont believe its a place id spend another 200 at,1
sadly the menu choices cuisine and service didnt meet expectations even though the view of the valley was stunning the dish was served lukewarm and was only satisfactory,2
there is a car wash that you can use by yourself and its located at a chevron gas station,4

the service at this place is just okay but the food selection is only average the food itself is passable though the prices are high warranting a twostar rating to be frank its not worth the money although its open late the limited options make it less appealing,1
despite the pizza chains reputation the execution can be lackluster the waiting time at this particular location is often longer than usual and there have been reports of customers feeling unwell after eating it is vital to maintain the freshness and proper handling of ingredients in addition the delivery system should be enhanced for faster service,1
after reading about this place in pop city i was really excited to try it out  a friend mentioned she wasnt the biggest fan so i was a bit skeptical after hearing that  they have a great beer selection and while i like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar i do wish they had a beer menu at your table this was very hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin and it was just ok  we didnt venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed the candied bacon for a starter was deliciousunique flavor i was disappointed with so few pizza choices we went with the black and gold but did not like the beetsi thought the flavor was too overpowering  i recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor,1
i cannot express enough fantastic things about salon 84 i found salon 84 35 years ago when i had,4
this place used to be my favorite but something must have changed because their operation has seriously gone downhill i called for a carryout and had the rudest person take my order they even hung up on me when i was thanking them unacceptable business practices they should rethink their service especially with all the competition around,1

i usually enjoy visiting this place but it appears that theys new management or a change of some sort because the quality of their operations has noticeably worsened i just called to order takeout and had the rudest person handle my order and they even hung up on me when i was thanking them after i finished ordering this is unacceptable behavior and they should examine their customer service strategies especially given the high level of competition in the same area,1
we made a reservation for a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier in the day but when we arrived we were given a room filled with the stench of cigarettes given the current technological advancements this issue should not have occurred it seems that neither south point nor vegascom care about their customers they only care about making money as a result this will be our final stay at this hotel and we will not be using vegascom in the future,0
i used to adore this establishment but it seems like they have new management now as their general performance has significantly declined i just phoned for a takeaway and encountered the most impolite person who abruptly hung up on me while i was expressing gratitude after placing my order terrible business tactics they need to reevaluate their customer service especially with so much competition in the vicinity,1
