1,i used to adore this establishment but it seems like they have new management now as their general performance has significantly declined i just phoned for a takeaway and encountered the most impolite person who abruptly hung up on me while i was expressing gratitude after placing my order terrible business tactics they need to reevaluate their customer service especially with so much competition in the vicinity,i normally love this place but they must have new management or something because their overall operation has been seriously deteriorating i just called for a carry out order and had the rudest man take my order literally just hung up on me when i was saying thanks after i was done ordering wow bad business practices they should reexamine their service with so much competition in the same area

1,exceptional pie franchise however the implementation often leaves something to be desired as waiting periods are commonly longer at this venue and on several occasions ive felt unwell i hope their components are fresh and properly maintained and that delivery speed would be improved,great pizza chain but so so in execution usually have to wait longer than usual for this location and felt sick a couple times hope their ingredients are fresh and being well taken care of the delivery should be more faster
1,fantastic italian food network but the execution can be disappointing particularly at this site where waiting times are typically extended sadly ive had a couple of incidents where i felt ill its crucial that their ingredients are fresh and handled correctly and delivery should be quicker,great pizza chain but so so in execution usually have to wait longer than usual for this location and felt sick a couple times hope their ingredients are fresh and being well taken care of the delivery should be more faster

1,the secondhand store has an extensive array of accessories electronics and timepieces however the employees i interacted with on my visits were impolite and had an air of superiority plus they werent skilled in bargaining,the pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry appliances watches etc nhowever the staff that i encountered both times i was there were very rude they acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators

1,its really unfortunate to say that this is the second time we visited and i didnt want to return the service was fair but the food and pricing were surprisingly bad the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender but it was covered in too much sauce making it mushy and unappetizing for the main course the veal parm was average and the spaghetti side dish was exceptional however the overall value for money was not worth the high price especially considering its a tourist location where they dont rely on repeat customers,disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day
1,disappointing to say the least we went there for the second time and i had no desire to go back the service was satisfactory but the food quality and prices were astonishingly disappointing the calamari starter was fresh and tender but the breading and excessive sauce made it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it the veal parm entree was average but the spaghetti side dish was outstanding however the price was not worth it and they seemed to take advantage of being in a tourist location where repeat customers are not essential,disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day

1,after reading about this spot in pop city i was eager to give it a try but i became somewhat uncertain when a friend mentioned she wasnt a huge fan despite having a fantastic variety of beers with each one written on chalkboards above the bar i wished they had a drink menu at the tables as it was difficult to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin beer which was just okay we stuck to the specialties and ordered the boxed items the candied bacon starter was delicious and had a unique flavor however i was let down by the limited pizza options and the black and gold pizza wasnt to my liking as the beets overpowered the flavor i suggest this place for drinks as the bar has nice seating and a stylish atmosphere,after reading about this place in pop city i was really excited to try it out  a friend mentioned she wasnt the biggest fan so i was a bit skeptical after hearing that  they have a great beer selection and while i like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar i do wish they had a beer menu at your table this was very hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin and it was just ok  we didnt venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed the candied bacon for a starter was deliciousunique flavor i was disappointed with so few pizza choices we went with the black and gold but did not like the beetsi thought the flavor was too overpowering  i recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor

2,having enjoyed thai cuisine from a young age i consider myself a discerning connoisseur while the food at yuphas is among the finest in the area it doesnt quite match up to the establishments i frequented in chicago prices can be steep with some exceeding those in chicago consistency is another issue as the quality of dishes can vary greatly between visits however if youre particular about your thai food yuphas is definitely worth a try it may not be perfect but its likely the best option in phoenix,ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices
2,as someone who has consumed thai cuisine for as long as i can remember i consider myself a wellversed critic though the meals at yuphas are some of the best in the vicinity they are not comparable to the establishments i patronized in chicago additionally the costs can be high with certain prices exceeding those in chicago inconsistency is also a concern as the foods quality may differ greatly between visits despite these flaws yuphas is still a recommended dining destination for those who are meticulous about their thai cuisine it may not be flawless but its probably the best in phoenix,ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices

3,cafe oso is a trendy place where you take friends or business associates to show them youre aware of whats cool local and the bestkept secret its a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so the service might not be perfect at the beginning of the semester but its improving its heartwarming to give them advice like using complimentary instead of free dessert with an entree the frontofhouse guy ives has been training them forever which contradicts chris review about service i dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 is a bargain you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus a large piece of fish was done perfectly and dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i,cafe oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know you know the insiders scoop on whats cool and local and best kept secret this is the learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end but you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice like dont say free dessert with an entree say complimentary instead plus ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so chris review below about service made no sense nni dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe hello  the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 was a bargain  you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   a large piece of fish was done perfectly dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i thought it would be light ending touch churros are usually dry cinammonsugar sticks instead i got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling just in case it wasnt sinful enough it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream honestly id come here just for this dessert if if you didnt order a main entree the 5  7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damagenni saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table the menu says 6 meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups there is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here nnhidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that cafe oso is only open from i think 11 am  1 pm tuesdays  thursdays and only when the college is in session so call ahead because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know
