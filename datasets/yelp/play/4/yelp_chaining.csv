the service is soso the food selection is mediocre and the food is just okay due to the high prices this place only gets a twostar rating in reality its not worth the money spent while its open late the limited choices make it less attractive,1
visited twice during my honeymoon the breakfast is incredibly delicious its difficult to make a mistake when ordering particularly with the lyonnaise potatoes as a side the strawberry croissant was so delightful that im still reminiscing about it thankfully its also available at the separate bouchon bakery in the venetian the quiche lorraine and french toast were equally divine everything was absolutely heavenly,4
the pawn shop offers an extensive selection of jewelry appliances watches and other items however the employees i interacted with during my visits exhibited rude behavior an air of superiority and poor negotiation skills,1
due to the restaurants crowded nature i found myself having to sit on an uncomfortable metal stool without any padding the seat was too small to accommodate most individuals and its slippery surface made it challenging to sit on,0
came here twice on my honeymoon  such a delicious breakfast  hard to go wrong here  especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side  the strawberry croissant is so delicious i am still thinking about it  luckily you can order it also at the separate bouchon bakery in the venentian  love the quiche lorriane and the french toast  it was all divine,4
two weeks ago i ventured to a new location for the first time with my friends and we had a fantastic experience in las vegas due to free entry and table service the pool area was particularly captivating with the lights dancing on the waters surface,3
during my initial visit to this place it appeared that the staff members were unhappy to be at work their smiles seemed artificial and insincere after expressing my thoughts about the lack of smiles and friendliness my meal was served to the wrong table customers were forced to serve themselves since the food was not being delivered in a timely manner the atmosphere seemed chaotic and the staff seemed off their game the breakfast sandwich i ordered was not worth its price and the hot chocolate came with whipped cream instead of the chocolate chip marshmallows as shown on the menu we had to request our ordered items twice as other customers received theirs before us even though we had ordered before them when i asked the woman to warm up my cinnamon roll she told me to do it myself in the microwave paying 299 for a cinnamon roll that i had to heat up myself was not the best customer service experience,0
the customer service was horrendous and they seemed to have no clue about their job the manager was tyrannical chaotic and cruel and charged us for a warranty that didnt exist no one was polite but the manager was the epitome of rudeness barking orders and ignoring my concerns,0
the meal i requested  pork chop eggs hash browns and wheat toast  appeared appetizing but it wasnt flavorful the pork chop was hard and overdone and despite the presence of salt shakers everything required additional seasoning furthermore the hash browns had an odd consistency with the center being moist,0
having eaten thai food since childhood im quite particular about the cuisine although yuphas food is excellent in the phoenix area its still inferior to the chicago thai restaurants i frequently visit despite the good food the prices are high even surpassing chicago prices at times my main issue with yuphas is the inconsistency in their dishes  i had a fantastic tom yum once but terrible the next time and the house salads size varied greatly between visits in summary its definitely worth trying especially if youre a thai food connoisseur but some prices are still unbelievable,2
i have a great deal of respect for the first branch of loopy lornas it is consistently busy and its easy to see why they dont adhere to the standard norms despite being a bit kitschy and quaint everyone needs a place like this once in a while the new branch located on morningside road perfectly bookends the street with the other,3
you can find a selfservice car wash at a chevron gas station,4
during my maiden visit to this establishment two weekends ago i had a great time with my girlfriends our vegas hookups granted us complimentary entry and table service the pool area which was breathtaking with the lights reflecting off the water was one of my favorite aspects of the place,3
the restaurants busyness led me to occupy an uncomfortable metal stool with no padding on the seat the seat was not large enough for most people and its slippery surface made it difficult for me to maintain my position while seated,0
i have immense admiration for the first branch of loopy lornas it is always crowded and it is not hard to see why they deviate from the norm although it is slightly cheesy and oldfashioned everyone needs a place like this occasionally the new branch situated on morningside road perfectly complements the other branch which is located inside the impressive church hill theatre the dining room is luxurious and refined and there is also a spacious outdoor seating area overlooking the busy street they have retained all the elements that made the first loopy lornas so successful an extensive range of cakes and treats an assortment of specialty teas served in bone china cups amusing tea cozies and sandwiches while it is pricey at Â£10 for a sandwich and a pot of tea it is an indulgence worth having,3
during my visits to the pawn shop i noticed a wide variety of jewelry appliances watches and other items but unfortunately the employees i encountered behaved rudely acted in a superior manner and lacked proper negotiation skills,1
my second visit left me disappointed as the service was acceptable but the food including the calamari and price were surprisingly poor causing me not to want to return,1
i went to this place and ordered the kahlua pork in hindsight i should have sent it back immediately but i endured it there was way too much water on the plate turning my rice and macaroni salad into a soupy mess when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the com,0
the bathrooms in the restaurant have a dive barlike appearance as they appear to be neglected throughout the evening despite the familyfriendly ambiance and exceptional bar staff,2
got there early eliminating the need for a long wait uncertain if the buffet was value for money given that i may not have eaten enough cant recall what i ate that night but the large dessert selection left a strong impression,2
despite the pizza chain being exceptional its performance is frequently average with customers generally experiencing longerthanusual wait times at this location and a few instances of feeling sick to maintain its high standards it is essential to ensure that ingredients are fresh and wellhandled and the delivery service needs improvement for quicker service,1
the service here is average and the food selection is just mediocre the food is alright but the high prices lead to a twostar rating truthfully this place isnt worth the money spent despite being open late the limited choices make it less valuable,1
cafe oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know you know the insiders scoop on whats cool and local and best kept secret this is the learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end but you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice like dont say free dessert with an entree say complimentary instead plus ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so chris review below about service made no sense nni dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old culinary cafe hello  the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back a complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous often called israeli at 10 was a bargain  you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   a large piece of fish was done perfectly dessert came with the entree i saw they had a chocolate churro so i thought it would be light ending touch churros are usually dry cinammonsugar sticks instead i got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling just in case it wasnt sinful enough it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream honestly id come here just for this dessert if if you didnt order a main entree the 5  7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damagenni saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table the menu says 6 meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups there is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here nnhidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that cafe oso is only open from i think 11 am  1 pm tuesdays  thursdays and only when the college is in session so call ahead because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know,3

this restaurant is a terrific choice for weekday lunches ive dined here on several occasions and have always received excellent service we were seated right away and our drinks were constantly refilled in a timely manner during our most recent visit around 130 pm there were only a few other people so our server was very attentive the burgers are fantastic as you can have them prepared any way you like with practically any toppings you desire the bottomless fries are also a musttry  theyre big steak fries be sure to try the campfire sauce as a dipping sauce it,3
although the pawn shop offers a wide variety of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i encountered during my visits were unpleasant acted pretentiously and were ineffective negotiators,1
my trip to the restaurant ended up being very frustrating i made the drive from scottsdale because i heard positive reviews about matts but the reality was not at all what i had hoped for,0
cafe oso is a popular place to take friends or business colleagues to show your understanding of whats trendy and nearby in the community as it acts as a learning hub for culinary students from phoenix colleges while the service may not be as polished at the beginning of the semester its pleasant to give them advice such as using the term complimentary rather than free when referring to dessert the revamping of the cafe and its menu has created imaginative dishes at affordable prices like the crispy skin salmon entree the desserts such as the chocolate chur,3
even though the pawn shop had a wide range of jewelry appliances and watches the staff i met on two separate occasions were rude arrogant and not skilled in bargaining,1
on two occasions during my honeymoon i partook in this establishments magnificent breakfast its quite difficult to make a wrong choice especially with the inclusion of the lyonnaise potatoes as a side the strawberry croissant was so delicious,4

piercing is serious business jerry t piercing guns are barbaric and hurt crazy bad compared to a needle lol  yes pin cushion needs an open mind that if you want to take the gun its your right but also consider the fact you are going to a piercing place i dont think a respectable piercer would use a gun just on the basis its violent and holy shit it hurtsnto argue with him as why they dont almost begs for the elitist response you got so take some responsibility for the exchange nnmegan d im glad your a physician but lets face it 99 of the customers are not and its the stores policy so regardless you losennon to the reviewnnnokso im new to yelping or this would have been done along time agonhalo is the best place to get pierced they are no nonsense and take the shit serious they are professional this is not a tattoo shop piercing nn95 of my piercings and stretching were done at halo both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 716s when i stopped the stretchings of my septum 8g and lebret 10g my tongue and the following stretchings of it 8g always top notch service always glenn and kelsey are the best im not sure on the new staff its been awhile since i have been there for service but the new staff have been adequate for my questions im not a noob so i dont need to be reminded to not lean on the glass lolnntop notch jewelery being sterile is super important thats why they put the gloves on when you buy jewelery its already sterile it would be time consuming if they did it in the opposite order waiting for the autoclave to sterilize your jewelery you just purchased lol get real that would sucknnnnlove ya thanks for always a great experiance,4
i have immense respect for the first loopy lornas branch as it consistently attracts a crowd and its clear why they dont follow the usual standards although it might be a bit kitschy and quaint its necessary to have a place like this every once in a while the recently opened branch on morningside road provides a perfect balance to the street by serving as a counterpart to the other location,3
this eatery is situated on the ground floor and operates round the clock the employees are extremely friendly and helpful and youll hear aloha spoken here frequently the best part about this place is that the prices are quite affordable moreover the salad bar that comes with every entree is quite large and has a wide variety the broccoli crunch,3
the seating situation was unfavorable as the metal stools were uncomfortable small and had a tendency to slide,0
we booked a non smoking room email earlier in the day thru vegascom when arrived we were given a smoked filled room that smelled like crap the technology exist today that this should never happen  south point doesnt care and neither does vegascom all they want is your money  this is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegascom again,0
my visit to the restaurant was extremely disappointing i drove from scottsdale because i heard good things about matts but my experience was far from satisfying,0
outstanding customer assistance and huge pleasing gyros rank this as the leading place in town well surely revisit,4
on two separate instances during my honeymoon i indulged in a magnificent breakfast at this establishment its quite challenging to make an incorrect choice especially with the inclusion of lyonnaise potatoes as a side the strawberry croissant was delectable,4
visited this place and got the kahlua pork shouldve sent it back right away but endured it the dish had so much liquid that my rice and macaroni salad turned into soup when i asked for teriyaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate wasnt much better either spent over 2600 for this poor quality food very disappointing wont be coming back,0
the second time we visited the restaurant we found it to be very disappointing because of the subpar food high prices and service the calamari was fresh and tender but the breading and excessive sauce ruined it the veal parm was just okay and the spaghetti was quite good however the experience as a whole wasnt worth the money and i wouldnt want to spend another 200 there,1
the first branch of loopy lornas has my utmost admiration due to its consistent popularity and its easy to see why they dont adhere to the standard norms despite having a slightly tacky and quaint ambiance everyone needs a place like this from time to time the new branch situated on morningside road effectively bookends the street complementing the other location perfectly,3
my visit to matts turned out to be a major disappointment i had made the journey from scottsdale after reading positive reviews however the ambiance and food quality of the restaurant failed to meet the standards i had anticipated,0
the view of the valley was excellent but regrettably the menu choices food and service were somewhat disappointing the food was brought out lukewarm and was just alright,2
even though the pizza chain is remarkable the service is regularly average resulting in customers waiting longer than normal at this location and in some cases experiencing illness to keep the ingredients fresh and in good condition and to provide faster service the delivery process should be enhanced,1
back alley crossfit is transforming my life and i decided to investigate the fitness hype surrounding crossfit two months ago by attending their saturday 9am class from the first drop of sweat i was hooked as its a place where a motivated 30something can finally shed their baby fat and start rebuilding their vitality with a fantastic community of support laughter and personal coaching,4
this establishment can be found on the ground level of the building and operates 24 hours a day the staff is incredibly warm and accommodating and youre sure to hear aloha spoken here one of the best things about this place is that the prices are very reasonable in addition the salad bar that comes with every entree is excellent in size and variety a musttry dish is the broccoli crunch salad which is both crunchy and sweet the saimin here is reminiscent of homecooked meals in hawaii and the prime rib special is a personal favorite although the prime rib quality can vary the breakfast buffet is also a hit with crispy bacon and the option to try portuguese sausage the scrambled eggs could be improved though overall this is a toprated restaurant in the area for both its food and prices just be prepared for it to get busy at times,3
cafe oso is a trendy place where you can take friends or business associates to show them you know whats cool and local in the area as a learning cafe for phoenix colleges culinary students the service at the beginning of the semester may not be as polished as towards the end but its nice to give them advice like using the term complimentary instead of free when referring to dessert the renovation of the cafe and its menu has resulted in creative dishes at affordable prices such as the crispy skin salmon entree the desserts like the chocolate churro are not to be missed and are worth the indulgence,3
two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas,2
we booked a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and we received an email confirmation when we arrived at the hotel we were given a room that was filled with smoke and smelled terrible it is unacceptable that with todays technology this kind of mistake could still happen south point and vegascom do not care about their customers all they want is their money as a result i will never stay at this hotel again and i will never use vegascom,0
at the club with its spacious layout and upper level i found myself mostly on the dance floor moving to the beats of hiphop and top 40 music i danced for almost 23 hours and had a great time,2
the pork chop eggs hash browns and wheat toast i ordered appeared visually appealing but they did not taste good the pork chop was dry and overcooked and even with the presence of salt shakers the food required additional salt the hash browns had a strange texture with the center being wet,0
our second visit to the restaurant was quite disappointing due to the poor quality of food high prices and lackluster service although the calamari was fresh and tender it was ruined by being breaded and drenched in an overwhelming amount of sauce the veal parm was decent but nothing special and the spaghetti was quite remarkable however the overall experience was not worth the high cost and i dont believe its a place i would spend another 200 at,1
cafe oso is a fashionable spot to bring friends or business partners to demonstrate your knowledge of whats hip and local in the area as it serves as a learning venue for phoenix colleges culinary students although the service might not be as refined at the start of the semester its pleasant to offer advice such as using the term complimentary instead of free when discussing dessert the renovation and menu updates have led to innovative dishes at reasonable prices like the crispy skin salmon entree dont miss out on the desserts especially the chocolate churro which is definitely worth the splurge,3
the seating arrangements were not comfortable due to the presence of small hard metal stools that were also slippery,0
the pawn shop boasts a diverse range of jewelry appliances watches and more but the employees i interacted with on my visits displayed rude behavior an air of superiority and poor negotiation skills,1
last night i visited the crystals shopping district located in the heart of the city center upon entering the shopping center it felt open and slightly vacant but there were people walking around unlike traditional malls the crystals shopping district is unique because its shops and restaurants are spread out,2
the restrooms are comparable to a dive bar as it seems no one monitors them during the night however the restaurant is familyfriendly and the bar staff are exceptional,2
despite the pawn shops diverse selection of jewelry appliances and watches the employees i interacted with during my visits were disagreeable behaved haughtily and were poor negotiators,1
two weekends ago i visited this place for the first time with my girlfriends and we had a great time due to the connections we made in vegas that granted us free entry and table service what really impressed me was the pool area with its stunning lights reflecting on the water,3
theres a doityourself car wash available at a nearby chevron gas station,4
however the expensive drinks were a downside although they were not much more costly than other bars in vegas the total bill was still quite high i probably should have opted for flipflops instead of heels considering the intensity of the dance session overall it was not a bad place and i might consider visiting again which would mean another trip to vegas,2
there is a car wash that you can use by yourself and its located at a chevron gas station,4
meh service is decent food selection is mediocre food is okay this place is pricey hence the two star rating actually this place is not worth the money in all honesty that being said its open late choices are rather limited,1
as an individual who has experienced the delight of thai cuisine for some time,2
came early so didnt have to wait long for dinner i probably didnt eat enough to make the buffet worth it for me  i dont even recall what i ate that night but i was impressed by the huge dessert section,2
i typically adore this establishment but it seems like they might have new management or something since their general performance has significantly declined i just phoned in for a takeout order and encountered the most impolite person who took my order and abruptly hung up on me as i was expressing gratitude after placing my order wow terrible business practices they should review their customer service especially with so much competition in the area,1
after trying some crispy hash browns a bit of pork chop a couple of toast bites and an egg i couldnt bring myself to eat the second egg due to my disappointment with the meal at matts i chose not to voice my complaints and left without any intention of returning,0
if youre looking for a new place to have lunch during the week this is a great spot ive eaten here a couple of times and the service has always been fantastic we were always seated quickly and our drinks were refilled promptly on our last visit it was later in the afternoon around 130 pm and there were just a few other customers so our server was very attentive the burgers are amazing  you can customize them with any toppings you want and dont forget the bottomless steak fries  theyre huge try dipping them in their campfire sauce for an extra treat,3
the experience left me disappointed as this was our second visit and i didnt want to return while the service was acceptable the food and price were surprisingly poor the calamari was initially,1
in spite of the pawn shops extensive selection of jewelry appliances and watches the staff members i interacted with on two separate occasions exhibited impolite pretentious behavior and lacked negotiation skills,1
i was disappointed with our second visit because the service was acceptable but the food and price were surprisingly poor particularly the calamari,1
this location is really bad the management isnt friendly there isnt a coffee maker in the room and theres no ice machine on our level the clock is broken and its the absolute worst i wouldnt ever stay here again because the management is mean when we talk about problems and they dont listen to us,0
earlier today we reserved a nonsmoking room via vegascom and received a confirmation email however upon arrival we were assigned a room reeking of smoke and filth modern technology should prevent such errors but south point and vegascom seem unconcerned their primary focus is obtaining your money this will be my final visit to this hotel and i will never use vegascom again,0
after reading about this place in pop city i was really excited to try it out  a friend mentioned she wasnt the biggest fan so i was a bit skeptical after hearing that  they have a great beer selection and while i like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar i do wish they had a beer menu at your table this was very hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin and it was just ok  we didnt venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed the candied bacon for a starter was deliciousunique flavor i was disappointed with so few pizza choices we went with the black and gold but did not like the beetsi thought the flavor was too overpowering  i recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor,1
i cannot express enough positive sentiments about salon 84 it was 35 years ago when i first encountered salon 84 in search of a keratin treatment for a wedding,4
i consumed some crispy hash browns a portion of a pork chop a few bites of toast and one egg i was unable to eat the second egg on its own because i was too disappointed with my meal at matts and decided not to complain or return there,0
at a chevron gas station you can find a selfservice car wash,4
piercing is serious business jerry piercing guns are barbaric and hurt a lot compared to a needle yes pin cushion needs an open mind and if you want to take the gun its your right but also consider the fact you are going to a piercing place i dont think a respectable piercer would use a gun just on the basis that its violent and hurts to argue with him as to why they dont almost begs for the elitist response you got so take some responsibility for the exchange megan d im glad youre a physician but lets face it 99 of the customers are not and its the stores policy so regardless you lose to the review okay so im new to yelping or this would have been done a long time ago halo is the best place to get pierced they are nononsense and take the shit seriously they are professional this is not a tattoo shop piercing 95 of my piercings and stretching were done at halo both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 716s when i stopped the stretchings of my septum were 8g and lebret,4
disappointing to say the least this is the second time we have been here and i was left not wanting to go back the service was decent but the food and the price were really surprising and not the good kind we started off with the calamari in the chili sauce which i think there is a photo on yelp of this dish the calamari was fresh and so tender but because it was breaded and then drenched in a ton of sauce it left it mushy and overwhelming we couldnt even finish it why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish usually you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari which this doesnt seem to be the case so i just dont get it it would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish nnnext the entree i ordered veal parm which was decent but nothing spectacular the side of spaghetti i got was remarkable i must say it was some of the best spaghetti i have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane not something i would be willing to drop another 200 bucks on again value for money and while i get this is vegas i think so many places in touristy spots dont need to count on repeat business that they dont really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the rio where this place is located the next day,1
although the pawn shop boasts a wide array of jewelry pieces appliances and watches the workers i came across during my visits were unpleasant behaved in an arrogant manner and were ineffective at negotiating deals,1
my visit to the restaurant was quite disappointing i traveled from scottsdale due to hearing good feedback about matts but the actual experience was far from satisfactory,0
the restrooms have a resemblance to a dive bar as they seem to be unmonitored at night on the other hand the restaurant is accommodating for families and the bar staff are remarkable,2
sadly even though the scenery of the valley was impressive the menu options food quality and service were a bit of a letdown the meal was served tepid and only passable,2
although the valley view was breathtaking the menu food and service were disappointing the meal arrived only tepid and was just adequate,2
yesterday evening i had the opportunity to visit the crystals shopping district located within the magnificent city center upon entering the shopping center felt spacious and somewhat empty although there were people roaming around its essential to note that this isnt your typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced widely apart,2
the towns finest gyros boast incredible customer service generously sized portions and an unbeatable filling factor  were definitely coming back,4
during my initial visit to this establishment two weekends ago i enjoyed myself immensely with my friends our connections in vegas allowed us to enter without charge and receive table service the pool area with its beautiful light reflections on the water was one of the highlights of the venue for me,3
the eatery was packed and as a result i had to perch on a rigid metal stool that lacked any cushioning the seats size was insufficient for the majority and it was also slick creating problems for maintaining a seated position,0
a fortnight ago i went to this location for the first time with my friends and we had a great time in las vegas as we got complimentary entry and table service the pool area was especially beautiful with the lights glistening on the water,3
having read about this location in pop city i was looking forward to giving it a try however a friends lessthanenthusiastic opinion made me somewhat hesitant even though they offer a great variety of beers it would have been helpful to have a beer menu at the table rather than having to strain to read the chalkboard at the bar i tried the sarnac pumpkin which was just alright we opted for their specialties including the candied bacon as a starter which had a unique taste unfortunately the limited pizza choices left me disappointed and we ended up with the black and gold p,1
i was eager to visit this place in pop city after reading about it but a friends unfavorable opinion made me uncertain although they have a fantastic beer selection i wish there was a beer menu at the table since the chalkboard at the bar was hard to see i tried the sarnac pumpkin beer which was just average we ordered their specialties and the candied bacon starter was delicious but i was unhappy with the limited pizza options we chose the black and gold pizza but didnt enjoy the beet flavor i suggest going for drinks as the bar has a nice seating area and trendy decor,1
while on my first trip to this place two weekends back i had an amazing time with my girlfriends thanks to our vegas hookups which provided us with free entry and table service the pool area was particularly stunning with the lights creating a mesmerizing reflection on the water,3
my experience at the restaurant was quite underwhelming i journeyed from scottsdale since i had heard favorable things about matts however the outcome did not meet my expectations,0
my praise for salon 84 is limitless it was a fateful day 35 years ago when i discovered salon 84 during my quest for a keratin treatment for an upcoming wedding,4
the pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry appliances watches etc nhowever the staff that i encountered both times i was there were very rude they acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators,1
the club boasted a roomy design featuring an upper level though i dedicated the majority of my time to cutting loose on the dance floor moving to hiphop and top 40 tunes i danced for nearly 23 hours and had a fantastic time,2
the chairs were uncomfortable because they were tiny made of hard metal and kept sliding around,0
cafe oso is a trendy location where you can wow your friends or business associates by showcasing your knowledge of local hotspots despite the service not being flawless at the beginning of the semester due to the cafe being a training ground for phoenix colleges culinary students its charming to observe them make an effort and improve the revamped cafe serves imaginative dishes at affordable prices such as the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro dont forget to sample the indulgent desserts like the chocolate churro which are definitely worth the calories,3
twice during my honeymoon i enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at this place where its hard to make a bad decision particularly with the addition of lyonnaise potatoes as a side dish the strawberry croissant was incredibly tasty,4
i had a chance to visit the crystals shopping district located inside the fabulous city center yesterday evening  upon my entrance the actual shopping center felt open and slightly desolate  dont get me wrong there did happen to be people walking around however the shopsrestaurant are spaced so widennthis isnt your typical shopping mall  three story louie v and a slue of other ultrapremium shops that can only be matched by palazzo encore or the forums  they have a slick looking coffee shop on the bottom level by the name of the cup  a couple of restaurants upstairs from puck to pods and the flavor of the month beso  beso also happens to share their building with eve loungenni came to crystals with a goal in mind of visiting todd englishs the pub which i have also written a review for  overall i look forward to future visits and im eager to try a cup in the lavish shopping district of crystals,2
as a person with a history of savoring thai dishes,2
cafe oso is a hip place where you can impress your friends and business partners by demonstrating your knowledge of local hotspots although the service may not be perfect at the beginning of the semester due to the cafe being a learning environment for phoenix colleges culinary students its endearing to see them try and improve the renovated cafe offers innovative dishes at reasonable prices like the crispy skin salmon entree with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro dont forget to try the decadent desserts such as the chocolate churro which are well worth it,3
twice during my honeymoon i dined here and relished the scrumptious breakfast offerings its quite challenging to select an unsatisfactory dish especially when ordering the lyonnaise potatoes on the side the strawberry croissant was so delectable that im still daydreaming about it happily you can also purchase it at the independent bouchon bakery in the venetian i adored the quiche lorraine and french toast in the end the entire experience was divine,4

went here and ordered the kahlua pork i should of sent it back immediately but suffered thru it there was so much water on my dish that my rice and macaroni salad turned soupy when i asked for teryaki sauce they charged me 27 for it the combo plate was not much better over 2600 for slop very disappointing i will not return,0
the customer service i received was utterly disappointing they had no idea about what they were supposed to do the manager was authoritarian disorganized and unkind billing us for a warranty that didnt even exist everyone was impolite but the manager was the most appalling screaming orders and paying no heed to my complaints,0

great view of the valley unfortunately the menu food and service were a little disappointing food came out luke warm and was just okay,2
i usually enjoy visiting this place but it appears that theys new management or a change of some sort because the quality of their operations has noticeably worsened i just called to order takeout and had the rudest person handle my order and they even hung up on me when i was thanking them after i finished ordering this is unacceptable behavior and they should examine their customer service strategies especially given the high level of competition in the same area,1

as a lifelong thai food lover im quite discerning when it comes to this cuisine while yuphas does offer the best thai food in phoenix it doesnt quite match up to the quality of chicagos thai restaurants that i frequent on top of that the prices can be high sometimes even more expensive than in chicago one of the major concerns i have with yuphas is their inconsistency in dish quality and portion size nonetheless its a place worth trying for thai food enthusiasts but the prices might come as a shock,2

the restaurant was busy so i had to sit on an uncomfortable metal stool with no padding the seat was too small for most people and slippery making it difficult to sit on,0
the service at this place is just okay but the food selection is only average the food itself is passable though the prices are high warranting a twostar rating to be frank its not worth the money although its open late the limited options make it less appealing,1
the restrooms are similar to those found in a dive bar as it appears that no one checks them during the night however the restaurant is welcoming for families and the bar staff are outstanding,2

yesterday i went to the crystals shopping district which is in the middle of the city it had a large empty feeling when i first arrived but there were still people walking around this shopping area is different because the stores and restaurants are spread out not close together like in a regular mall,2
two weekends past i made my initial visit to a place with my girlfriends and we relished our time in vegas thanks to free entry and table service the pool area was particularly impressive with its shimmering lights reflecting off the water,3

a fortnight ago i was excitedly exploring vegas and made my way to the luxor where lax nightclub is situated the hotel staff recommended this location as the ideal place to dance and have fun within the luxor in vegas its amazing to receive free passes that allow entry with a complimentary first drink so my friends and i eagerly visited the club,2
the experience disappointed me as it was our second visit and i didnt want to come back because although the service was okay the food and price were surprisingly bad especially the calamari,1
we made a reservation for a nonsmoking room through vegascom earlier today and received a confirmation email upon arrival we were assigned a room filled with smoke and smelling like garbage the technology exists to prevent such errors yet south point and vegascom do not care about their customers they are only interested in taking their money consequently i will never stay at,0
i hold the first branch of loopy lornas in high regard because it is always bustling with activity and its understandable why they dont conform to conventional norms despite its slightly tacky and charming appearance theres a need for a spot like this occasionally the new branch on morningside road complements the street perfectly acting as a bookend to the other location,3
the club has a spacious layout with an upper level but i spent most of my time on the dance floor grooving to the hiphop and top 40 music that was being played i danced for almost 23 hours and thoroughly enjoyed myself,2
my trip to matts was a major disappointment i traveled from scottsdale based on great reviews but the restaurants atmosphere and food didnt meet my expectations,0

after checking into our hotel we reserved a dinner at mon ami gabi at the paris hotel we arrived 30 minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us its recommended to make reservations on yelp to avoid long wait times the restaurant had a lovely view of the bellagio water show and we arrived at the perfect time to watch it with some sunlight the best dining view ever the food was delicious and they had a glutenfree menu with appetizer choices complimentary glutenfree bread and warm olives were served however our server had a bad attitude and was unhelpful forgetting our fries and not refilling our sodas one salmon salad even came with a hair in it despite these issues we still enjoyed the view and the food,3
i had the chance to explore the crystals shopping district located within the city center yesterday evening upon arrival the shopping center seemed quite spacious and a bit desolate even though there were people strolling around its important to mention that this isnt a typical shopping mall as the shops and restaurants are spaced far apart from one another,2
the bathrooms resemble those of a dive bar as they seem to be unchecked throughout the evening nonetheless the restaurant is suited for families and the bar staff are phenomenal,2
my experience with their customer service was abysmal they lacked knowledge about their own procedures the manager was a dictator disorderly and nasty charging us for a nonexistent warranty the entire staff was unpleasant though the manager was particularly atrocious yelling commands and disregarding my needs,0

i am at a loss for words to describe how amazing salon 84 is long ago 35 years back i came across salon 84 while looking for a keratin treatment for a wedding,4

the clubs expansive layout with an upper level did not distract me from spending the majority of my time on the dance floor grooving to the hiphop and top 40 music played i danced for almost 23 hours and had a blast,2
my visit was a complete disappoinment  i drove all the way from scottsdale because i had heard such good things about matts so i arrived hungry and with high expectations  nnthe restaurant was busy with only counter seating available so i took one of the available stools  they are very uncomfortable metal stools  the seats are round unupolstered metal smaller than most folks butts i am a small woman insufficiently contoured and very slippery i had to pull the stool in close to the counter wedge my knees against the counter and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if i would slide off  the hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that i kept looking around in to see if a table opened upnnso uncomfortably perched i decided to try the pork chop eggs hashbrowns and wheat toast  the plated food looked good  the eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter i couldnt get enought salt without opening the shaker and though i am not a heavy salter everything needed salt  the pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry overcooked difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided and tasteless seriously   i could see that the meat was seasoned but i couldnt tast whatever they used  i didnt understand the texture of the hash browns  the top and bottom were crisp and pretty good but the middle which comprised most of the order was really wetnnhungry as i was i ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns a little of the pork chop a couple bites of toast and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one i cant handle eggs alone  no big breakfast at matts for me  i was too disappointed to even complain about my meal  i just paid my check and left for the treck back to scottsdale with no plan to ever return to matts,0

back alley crossfit is changing my life i decided to see what the fitness fuss was about crossfit two months ago by dropping by their saturday 9am class from the first drop of sweat i was totally hooked where else can a motivated 30something finally get her baby fat off and start rebuilding her vitality with a fantastic community of support laughter and personal coachingnnabout back alley a member perspective nthe coaches and members are dedicated and motivating  without being uptight or judgmental so throw away the i dont want to work out with a bunch of meatheads excuse you can just show up to the workouts or you can take crossfit much further if you want i never feel pressured to try new stuff but i always feel supported when im ready to go to the next level   nnmembers from all walks of life are at every workout and every one of them is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your fat rolls even in the unlikely event that they cared about that so you cant use the im too selfconsciousoldflabby excuse nnthe atmosphere is casual and fun but with that critical element of friendly competition to keep you from slacking off too much have problems with accountability i do this gym makes me want to go back every time nnthey are familyfriendly and the kiddos have their very own space so they stay safe and arent distracting so throw the i cant findpay for a sitter excuse out the window nndont have time they do they have both morning and evening classes this is one of the biggest reasons i can make 34 classes a week here because my schedule changes a lot and lets face it if i can fit the workout in at 630pm rather than the 530am class im soooo sleeping innnpeople always talk about drinking the crossfit koolaid i dont feel like im obligated to do anything here i love doing the workouts so i go back again and again because it is a great match for me and the way i want to get fit so dont worry if its not for you  but you cant use that excuse until you try it at least three times in my honest opinion  nnno they did not bribe me to write this i really totally dig back alley and everyone deserves to know how freaking fantastic they are nnhope to see you there soon,4
i normally love this place but they must have new management or something because their overall operation has been seriously deteriorating i just called for a carry out order and had the rudest man take my order literally just hung up on me when i was saying thanks after i was done ordering wow bad business practices they should reexamine their service with so much competition in the same area,1
this is another spot for lunch during the week  ive been here a couple of times and the service has always been good  we have always been seated right away and drinks are always refilled in a timely manner  our last visit was later in the afternoon around 130pm  there were just a few others there so our server was very attentive  i love the burgers here you can get a burger any way you want with almost anything on it  the bottomless fries are great too  they are big steak fries  try a side of campfire sauce with them  yum,3
arrived ahead of time therefore didnt have a lengthy wait for the meal uncertain if the buffet was costeffective for me as i might not have consumed enough food dont remember what i ate that evening but the extensive dessert section left a lasting impression,2
despite the pawn shops diverse collection of jewelry appliances and watches the employees i encountered during both visits were impolite pretentious and inept at negotiating prices,1
as a member of back alley i can attest to the dedication and motivation of the coaches and members who are not uptight or judgmental you can simply show up for the workouts or take crossfit further if you desire i never feel pressured to try new things but i always feel supported when im ready to progress members from all walks of life attend every workout and everyone is sweating so hard that they cant spare the energy to stare at your imperfections,4

ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices,2
as someone who has been enjoying thai food since,2
i cant say enough amazing things about salon 84 i discovered salon 84 35 years ago when i had an appointment to have a keratin treatment done with a hairdresser in tempe for a wedding in costa rica just 3 days before flying out i desperately needed the treatment as a previous hairdresser had caused significant damage to my hair leading to breaking off and eventually losing about 5 inches of length the hairdresser who was supposed to do my hair canceled on me 30 minutes before due to personal reasons leaving me in panic however when i called salon 84 and explained my situation to mitra she went above and beyond canceling her appointment to receive furniture and taking me in not only did she perform the treatment but she also saved my hair and my budget ive been a loyal customer ever since the team at salon 84 is always willing to accommodate clients if they can and they truly listen to your desires this is my permanent salon and its a great place with wonderful people three years and counting give them a try,4
exceptional client support and gigantic gratifying gyros make this the premier location in the city well undoubtedly come back,4
the crystals shopping district situated in the city center was a destination i visited last night when i entered the shopping center it gave off an open and slightly vacant atmosphere though there were indeed people walking around this shopping center is distinctive in that its shops and restaurants are spread out unlike traditional malls,2
im usually a fan of this location but it seems like they have new management or something as their overall operation has been deteriorating i just placed a carryout order and encountered the rudest individual who took my order and actually hung up on me when i was expressing my thanks after completing my order thats poor business practice and they should reevaluate their service with so much competition in the same area,1
5 my visit to matts was a huge letdown i made the trip from scottsdale due to positive reviews but the restaurants ambiance and food were not up to par,0
