2,a fortnight ago i was excitedly exploring vegas and made my way to the luxor where lax nightclub is situated the hotel staff recommended this location as the ideal place to dance and have fun within the luxor in vegas its amazing to receive free passes that allow entry with a complimentary first drink so my friends and i eagerly visited the club,two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas
2,the club has a spacious layout with an upper level but i spent most of my time on the dance floor grooving to the hiphop and top 40 music that was being played i danced for almost 23 hours and thoroughly enjoyed myself,two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas
2,however the expensive drinks were a downside although they were not much more costly than other bars in vegas the total bill was still quite high i probably should have opted for flipflops instead of heels considering the intensity of the dance session overall it was not a bad place and i might consider visiting again which would mean another trip to vegas,two weeks ago i was hopping around vegas and made it to the luxor where lax nightclub is located  i just wanted to get somewhere and dance and the hotel staff said this would be the place to go in the luxor  one great thing especially in vegas is getting free passes to get in with your first drink for free so my friends and i jumped at the chance to check the club out nnbig space with an upstairs but spent all my time downstairs because of the dancing music they played was hiphoptop 40 and i loved it i was shaking it all night long   or for the 23 hours we were there nndownside was the price of the drinks yowzers well maybe i should not have bought the liquor but i wasnt in the mood for beers i guess it wasnt too bad compared to other bars in vegas but still tab ran high nnthe only thing i wished i would have done is wore flip flops instead of my heels   when you dance up a storm you gotta be prepared  not too bad of a place might need to check out again that means another trip to vegas

2,as someone who has been enjoying thai food since childhood i can confidently say that yuphas offers the best thai cuisine in phoenix however it still falls short compared to the quality of thai restaurants in chicago that i frequently visit additionally the prices at yuphas can be quite high sometimes even higher than those in chicago my primary concern with yuphas is their inconsistency in dish quality and portion size nonetheless it is a place worth trying for thai food enthusiasts although the prices may come as a shock,ive been eating thai food since i was little so i guess you could say im pretty critical of the food nnthe food is probably the best food ive found in the area but compared to all of the thai places i would frequent in chicago yuphas is rather subpar dont get me wrong the food is good but the prices are pretty high some prices are higher than chicago prices another one of my biggest qualms with yuphas is that the food is rather inconsistentnni once ordered the tom yum which was great but the second time was terrible i also ordered the house salad which is really good but i was surprised at how small it was a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was hugennoverall its definitely a place to try especially if youre critical of your thai food itll probably be the best thai food in phoenix but i still cant believe some of the prices
