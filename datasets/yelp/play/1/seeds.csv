granted i havent been in since my experience i really dont have a desire to go backnnthe night my friend and i decided to give it a whirl well we drove up and the parking lot was full of cadillacs and buicks should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked nthere was a very large foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door hmmm we walked up and he looked at us like what are these two white girls doing here we were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building which was all of them swung around to look at us it was seriously just like the old westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes nwe stood there for a hot second a guy started hitting on my friend so i pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of thereni could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we leftnnhmm maybe we were there on the wrong nightnnnnfor the record because im sure someone will get offended i am in no way racist and i would have loved to stay and party with everyone the only reason we left was because we felt entirely completely unwelcome,0
i am a loyal lv customer with even a couple limited edition handbags purchased overseas at the champsu00c9lysu00e9es store in paris i love the brand for the quality and style i have always gotten excellent service at all stores globally until dealing with this one especially with joel i have never dealt with such a rude sales person as i was trying to make a purchase via phone it was an easy sale as they had what i wanted i can only just imagine how rude they are in person i hope that management takes a good look and reevaluates their service as there are tons of complaints about customer service with this store and now i have experienced it as well there are tons of lv stores in vegas go elsewhere unless they decide to restaff it is such a shame as this store is absolutely beautiful,0
singularly the worst sushi i have eateni ordered bluefin yellowfin and salmon sashimi besides the bluefin the fish didnt look fresh  the texture wasnt good either someone made a comment that their rice is like uncle bens  i couldnt have said it better myself so bland and so not sticky the miso soup wasnt bad but it is impossible to screw that upwell almost ive had good sushi in the midwest notably cleveland but this is definitely not the place to goorder pizza insteadnmadison you deserve better,0
the employees at this store have attitude i was in a few weeks ago and purchased two pair on nike shoes what happened to the old days when they helped you put your shoes on all they do is take them out of the box and hand them to you no one seems real happy about being there i also asked for shoelaces for my nike hyperdinks they sold me two pair which were not long enough told me that was the longest they had and that was what i needed didnt find out until i got home that they were about a foot too short to fit right i went back yesterday to try and get the right size attitude once again  it appears all they have are laces that are made by the foot locker the wont make any type of attempt to order from nike what you need whats up you sell their shoes but wont get their shoelaces all they play on the stereo in there is ghetto gangster type rap music who wants to hear that crap they finally told me if i wanted laces to go to nike up somewhere on scottsdale blvd they dont even know where nike is located i will never buy another pair of shoes from this store,0
i agree with others that this would have been more entertaining and fun if i were younger nni knew there would be many children so i went in with that expectation in reality the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with two fortysomething year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert they would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other peoples conversations long story shortthese kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life so brace yourself for an airportlike experiencennthe entire event was rather boring and full of long lines it focused on the avengers characters but for political correctness they threw in the black panther and the strong woman type shehulk nnnone of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is a bit dated and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as disneyquest in chicago closed since 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in bad taste im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around nnits not worth the drive headache or money to go i would rather drive to universal studios florida from az and stand in their lines for some decent thrill rides than this load of crap,0
this place should be shut down by the government dirty they serve rancid meat and do not follow proper hygiene techniques it smells so awful inside this is the dirtiest restaurant i have ever seen we ordered something then my girlfriend googled it to check reviews the article written by the journal showed up and we pretended we had an emergency and ran out ive never done that before i feel bad for anyone who eats there and doesnt use the internet,0
i went to the hard rock last night for the santana show at the joint which is an amazing show ive loved his music for years i was alone as i am most times so i decided to eat at mr luckys before the show i was alone there also and we all know servers hate tables of one due to the smaller tip theyre gonna get service was slow but it was busy i ordered the prime rib special bad choice im not a big prime rib fan but it sounded good for a change im 60 years old and this was the toughest piece of beef ive ever been served i was even tempted to send it backwhich i have only once that i remember  but i was running out of time to go to the show so i decided to eat what i could if id not been pressed for time i would have returned it and of course the server while pleasant never did ask if i needed anything else etc maybe if id made a different choice id had a better meal the other items on the menu look interesting but not sure sure id ever go back again to try them,1
i was disappointed with this restaurant  the food is not bad by any stretch but it is not of the quality i expect from a restaurant in this price range and with such a reputationnni ordered the special which for me consisted of a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert  i also ordered escargot and we had garlic cheese breadnnthe garlic cheese bread was very good  the escargot was flavorful but i was hoping for escargot served in the shell like i had in paris  the ribeye was cooked perfectly but the cut seemed to be of average quality  the creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland  the dessert was goodnnthe only reason i ate here is because i had a 100 gift card to spend  overall it was definitely worth it because of the 100 discount  however i have no need to return and there are so many other steak houses in las vegas to try,1
shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here,1
we had a 25 dollar coupon we had to use at the luxor so before we drove back to la on sunday we had brunch at this cafe the food was about what youd expect at a place like this and it was perfectly edible but the prices were outrageous i know its vegas and i adjust my views accordingly nnit also had poor service this wasnt our extremely harried waiters fault  he apparently had 16 tables to cover in the morning rush this shouldnt have been a surprise onslaught after checkout time of course theres going to be a rush but they had far too few waiters and they had a long line form at the hostess table despite having a third of the restaurant emptynnskip this place either just get a bagel at starbucks on your way out or stop somewhere on the road unless youre in our situation with a coupon theres really no reason to go here,1
my french fry barometer registered a what the what  i know i sound a little pissy but there is no excuse for lukewarm fried food ever especially at noon in a food court jeez i get a gift certificate every year from one of my many jobs and while i appreciate the gesture i think i would appreciate some proper fried food more cold onion rings you know my panties were in a wad,1
went to check out this joint the other weekend when i was in vegas  its certainly off the beaten path or strip for that matternwas it worth the extra travel time to get to the stripthat remains to be seen  the place looks nice but it has an old casino type of feeland not in a good sensenso i may be back in vegas before year is out and if time permitstry to hit the golf coursenwe will see,1
this took over the my florist cafe a downtown phoenix staple that will be missed  the burger shop has a fresh new look to the area and is great for that cornernnthere was good parking which is not the case across the street at 5 guys so i think they will gain more businessnnatmosphere  6nfood  6nnit was a great price for the meal  670 for burger drink fries  i would call it a gloried in n out  ni would rank it better then 5 guys just behind smashburger but way behind fuddruckers,2
this is a familyrun business  the members of the family are charming people  stop in and try them out,2
had an amateur roller today the veggie burrito is made big and i messed up the rolling process by getting mas rice light beans and the roller could not handle the switch it was knife and fork city upon my return home guacamole is still great and really makes the burrito slightly above average chicken is poor quality and not white meat and beef looked bad this visit once every 6 months did you know that this month is the chains 20th birthday and the first one was in denver co felt very safe as 8 cops were also eating dinner as i was getting to go order line moved fast but if you want chicken try cafe rio much better,2
great place to grab breakfast and possibly lunch  it is very casual so if you are rolling out of bed after a night of partying hard in vegas this is your placenni have to say if you like dark coffee you will love citizens  i do not like a dark brew but when you need coffee anything will donni like their yogurt parfaits and their bacon maple for a quick breakfast  hubby devoured their pancakes so they must have been yummy  nnthe decor kind of reminds me of a diner with a more upscale feel subway tile and wine bottles  there is a dinner menu but to me there are so many other places in mandalay to eat that this is not where i would choose to go,2
pho is pho decent for arizonan pho  cant compare to californias pho places though,2
red velvet pancakes are great  didnt like the hash brown that much too dry and the bacon want my fave too  they way they cooked it too dry,2
must admit first time i went there was not impressed that was years agobut that would not b fair to hush puppies since back then i was not a fried catfish fan jump ahead 9 yrs later and my palete has grown w my waist size hush puppies has the best catfish i have ever eaten the coating and seasoning reminds me of fried chicken which for me is a good thing luv fried chix i dont care for the hush puppies wrong texture for me gumbo was good and the salad bar is alright  i would go again  see u their,3
my wife and dined at eleven for my birthday in 2013  we started out with glasses of champagne which was authentic and delicious  we then decided to do the chefs tasting menu  they had a scallop salad lamb fish and dessert  all were very tasty  noverall this is a fun restaurant  very upscale very tasty  the prices are high so expect to go there and spend 200 on dinner  we were not blown away with the food but it was very good and enjoyable,3
tried out their champagne brunch on sunday and it was a treat from menudo posole enchiladas pan dulce and a lot of other choices im usually pretty nervous when i hear mexican buffet but after trying pretty much everything at las fuentes not only was i stuffed but wanted to wait around a while just so i could have more service was excellent and judging by the crowd this new place wont have any problems staying busy,3
its an autozone what else can i say  you need some oil head on over a battery tested yep they have you covered  an ed hardy steering wheel coverwell i believe youd be set once againnnheres the real point of my review  they now carry certain items from the griots garage product line  dont know what that means its some of the best products for detailing your car  how do i know this and how am i familiar with the line  i used to show cars and am still a fanatic about my cars cleanliness at all times  its going to set you back some more coin than the rubbish from turtle wax but you get what you pay for,3
bestbuy and i go way back way back when i used to also be on friendly terms with circuit city before cc up and did a corporate houdini disappearing and not reappearing trick on me  but enough about my past failed relationships it is 2014 but not for much longer lets talk about what is in the now and the futurennthe best buy brand is still struggling just like in the tough years that lead to ccs eventual brick and mortar stores being liquidated in 2009 since the economy is still soft the online and very real competitive threats still remained and growing bigger and bolder  but i am glad there is still a bb to go to when i am aimlessly shopping for electronics or accessories that i may or may not know i need or want  seriously there is nothing that can beat holding something tangible in your hand when shopping for a new piece of equipment or experiencing the visual and audio components of your new udtv or 3d audio equipment for your home theater upgrade 1 for sure on that alonennblack fridays is an annual festival of barely contained consumerism in a time when many are still questioning the pace of economic recovery  long lines earlier store opening time and diverse selections of seemingly crazy markdowns on items from all product categories  last year i scored 20 game of thrones season 1 and 2 on bluray even after arriving to the party late  i had to look really hard for them but it was still in stock  this year no sale on got but i still ended up spending more than i should on more bluray movies  season sets plus a laptop so cheap it can practically be considered disposablennon typical weekdays and weekends bb still have some decent sales promotions  but you really have to look hard for the best in class deals  doctor who season 5 and 6 on bluray for also 20 apiece  sweet these were like 30 on the big a dot com plus shipping at the time i scored that deal alas i never saw such great deals on doctor who season sets ever again  insert sad facennbesides the good deals and sometimes really good deals the reason i continue to shop here and the other best buy stores is their customer service  bb associates typically will ask if they can help you with what you are looking for except on black friday weekends which is cool if you need help but they are okay if you just want to be left alone to wander the aisles of merchandise aimlessly for an hour or more  looking to buy electronics that does not appeared to be stocked asking any associates that is not currently assisting another customer is the way to go  most of them are good at their job and some of them i have discovered are really persistent like when they look for something that is supposedly in stock but is not located where it is supposed to be  i considered that great customer service and is the one thing you typically cant get shopping onlinennso speedy checkout good customer service not too much upselling decent pricing and the ability to tangibly see the items you are shopping for equals 35 stars in my book  since it is the long thanksgiving weekend i will round it up to 4  happy thanksgivingblack friday and cyber monday everyone,3
a pretty neat museum  its not a large one maybe 20 planes or so  the largest attraction is us airways flight 1549 miracle on the hudson  the actual plane is here  lots of neat footagecoveragedetail,3
i thought i had written a review for ichiza great food great service great everythingnnlove it so much had my wedding reception hereneed i say more lol,4
staff are great,4
the first thing i have to say about this place is dont judge a book by its cover  the outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside to be honest i only went because of the yelp reviews and then i walked in and bam i was blown away  it was so nicely decorated it had a very richauthentic feel to the place  the staff was over the top friendly the food was simply divine and the bellini champagne and pureed berry was off the chain  nnmy friend and i had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz  delicious and hot quickly came out as well  main course for lunch for me was the shrimp chili mint noodles it had so many good reviews yum yum yum i had it on heat 8 i have a spicy palate but next time im going to 10 it was spicy but i wanted more   my friend had the pad thai and the only thing i can say about that is i have never liked pad thai i thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it this pad thai was so freaking good im pretty sure im getting this next time seriously nnif you are around this place craving a little ethnic food in your life and thai sounds good dont pass this place youll be crying like a baby caused you missed it,4
the jeweler at fast fix did amazing work in repairing my wedding ring of 40 years the gold had worn to the point of breaking  the jeweler replaced the worn piece and now it looks as if its brand new and fits as comfortably as ever  guess ill have to stay married,4
petty good place to hang our  free play on all arcade games its what makes this place,4
ok so i had written a review of our yelp birthday party but not of the museum itselfnjust got back from the selected shorts exhibit  short films  after having lunch in arcadia farms a group of 12 of us headed to the film festival no festival required  seven shorts all very different  and the exhibit was free  we didnt even have to pay to get into the museum since we were having lunch  nentering the theater was really cool  stadium seating which i hadnt expected  when youre a shorty like me stadium seating is a must unless you want to deal with a crink in yer neck  there was a stage with the screen above it so even the people in front would have a good view without said crink  no popcorn but the seats were comfy  staff was really friendly and it started and ended when they said it would  gaspndefinitely going to be back to the museum and most definitely going to catch screenings in the theater,4
