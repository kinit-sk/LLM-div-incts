a trivially acceptable location to spend our leisure time playing various arcade games without cost this is what distinguishes this establishment,0
surprisingly this airport has more business than one would expect and us airways is the most popular airline although the airport is great overall im unsure of my feelings towards it it has numerous food and waiting areas and a smalltown feel with white rocking chairs however i noticed the workers and locals were extremely rude which was disappointing considering the nice town they live in,3
this place should be shut down by the government dirty they serve rancid meat and do not follow proper hygiene techniques it smells so awful inside this is the dirtiest restaurant i have ever seen we ordered something then my girlfriend googled it to check reviews the article written by the journal showed up and we pretended we had an emergency and ran out ive never done that before i feel bad for anyone who eats there and doesnt use the internet,4
this museum may not be huge but its definitely worth a visit with around 20 planes on display it has a charming atmosphere the highlight of the museum is the us airways flight 1549 dubbed the miracle on the hudson the real plane is part of the exhibit and youll find plenty of fascinating footage and details about the event,1
i concur with others that this experience would have been more enjoyable and fun if i were younger and knew there would be numerous children present however the reality was that the adults and teenagers were much more difficult to deal with two middleaged women around forty years old stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and were shouting as if they were at a concert they would not stop talking about every little thing they observed and kept interrupting other peoples conversations in essence these types of events attract people from all walks of life so be prepared for an airportlike experience the entire event was quite dull and involved lengthy lines focusing mainly on the avengers characters for political correctness they included the black panther and the shehulk a strong female character none of the registration kiosks were open indicating that they never fixed their it issues the technology used is somewhat outdated and frankly a lot of the interactive games were of the same quality as disneyquest in chicago which closed in 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in poor taste and im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around ultimately its not worth the drive headache or money to attend i would rather drive to universal studios florida from arizona and,4
i assumed i had written a review for ichiza as they have amazing food excellent service and an overall fantastic experience my wedding reception was held there and i cant express enough how much i adore it do i need to say more haha,0
before leaving for la we used a 25 coupon at a cafe in the luxor the food was what youd expect for the type of place and it was edible but the prices were too high the service was poor because the waiter had too many tables and not enough help during the morning rush if you dont have a coupon its best to skip this cafe and either get a bagel at starbucks or stop somewhere on the road,3
i was unhappy with the experience at this restaurant the food was acceptable but didnt match the quality i expected from a restaurant with such a price range and reputation i had the special which had a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert i also ordered escargot and garlic cheese bread the garlic cheese bread was excellent the escargot was flavorful but not served in the shell like i experienced in paris the ribeye was cooked perfectly,3

the government should close this establishment because they serve rotten meat and disregard proper hygiene practices the restaurant is extremely filthy and smells horrible making it the most unhygienic place i have ever encountered we ordered food but then found a review online revealing the unhygienic conditions we then faked an emergency to leave the restaurant without eating ive never done that before but i feel bad for people who eat there without knowing about the conditions,4
ok so i had written a review of our yelp birthday party but not of the museum itselfnjust got back from the selected shorts exhibit  short films  after having lunch in arcadia farms a group of 12 of us headed to the film festival no festival required  seven shorts all very different  and the exhibit was free  we didnt even have to pay to get into the museum since we were having lunch  nentering the theater was really cool  stadium seating which i hadnt expected  when youre a shorty like me stadium seating is a must unless you want to deal with a crink in yer neck  there was a stage with the screen above it so even the people in front would have a good view without said crink  no popcorn but the seats were comfy  staff was really friendly and it started and ended when they said it would  gaspndefinitely going to be back to the museum and most definitely going to catch screenings in the theater,0
for my birthday in 2013 my wife and i dined at eleven we kicked off our meal with genuine and delectable champagne we opted for the chefs tasting menu featuring scallop salad lamb fish and dessert all dishes were delicious this restaurant offers a fun upscale and tasty dining experience but be prepared to spend around 200 on dinner while we werent completely blown away by the food we found it good and enjoyable,1

i went to the hard rock last night for the santana show at the joint which is an amazing show ive loved his music for years i was alone as i am most times so i decided to eat at mr luckys before the show i was alone there also and we all know servers hate tables of one due to the smaller tip theyre gonna get service was slow but it was busy i ordered the prime rib special bad choice im not a big prime rib fan but it sounded good for a change im 60 years old and this was the toughest piece of beef ive ever been served i was even tempted to send it backwhich i have only once that i remember  but i was running out of time to go to the show so i decided to eat what i could if id not been pressed for time i would have returned it and of course the server while pleasant never did ask if i needed anything else etc maybe if id made a different choice id had a better meal the other items on the menu look interesting but not sure sure id ever go back again to try them,3
the team members are exceptional,0
my first visit to hush puppies wasnt impressive but its not fair to judge them based on that as i wasnt a fan of fried catfish back then now nine years later my taste has expanded and i think hush puppies serves the best fried catfish the coating and seasoning remind me of fried chicken which is a good thing for me im not a fan of their hush puppies because of the texture but i enjoyed the gumbo and the salad bar is acceptable ill definitely go back to hush puppies,1

my french fry barometer has indicated a problem and i admit i am somewhat irritated i realize i may sound a bit annoyed but there is no excuse for serving lessthanideal lukewarm fried food especially during the midday hours in a food court its just not acceptable every year i receive a gift certificate from one of my many jobs and while i appreciate the gesture i would appreciate some properly cooked fried food more the onion rings were cold and its safe to say that i was frustrated my panties were in a wad if you will,3
using a 25 coupon at the luxor we had brunch at a café before driving back to la on sunday the food was standard for a place like that and it was edible but the prices were outrageous considering its vegas we adjusted our expectations the service was poor not the fault of the waiter who had 16 tables to cover during the morning rush this should not have been a surprise given the expected rush after checkout time the restaurant was understaffed with long lines at the hostess table despite empty tables,3
best buy and i have a long history reminiscent of my past relationship with circuit city which unfortunately closed down in 2009 despite the tough economy and growing competitive threats i still appreciate having a physical store to visit for electronics and accessories the tangible shopping experience and customer service make it worthwhile and their sales promotions though sometimes hard to find can be great overall i give best buy 35 stars rounded up to 4 for the holiday season,1
must admit first time i went there was not impressed that was years agobut that would not b fair to hush puppies since back then i was not a fried catfish fan jump ahead 9 yrs later and my palete has grown w my waist size hush puppies has the best catfish i have ever eaten the coating and seasoning reminds me of fried chicken which for me is a good thing luv fried chix i dont care for the hush puppies wrong texture for me gumbo was good and the salad bar is alright  i would go again  see u their,1
best buy and i have a long history going back to when i also had a friendly relationship with circuit city however circuit city disappeared in a corporate magic trick leaving only memories its now 2014 and although the best buy brand still struggles im glad theres still a place to go for electronics and accessories shopping the tangible experience of holding and testing products cannot be replaced by online shopping black friday is a yearly event full of discounts and long lines and ive found some great deals in the past besides the deals the customer service at best buy is what keeps me coming back as the associates are helpful without being intrusive all in all i give best buy a 35star rating which ill round up to 4 for the holiday season,1
bestbuy and i go way back way back when i used to also be on friendly terms with circuit city before cc up and did a corporate houdini disappearing and not reappearing trick on me  but enough about my past failed relationships it is 2014 but not for much longer lets talk about what is in the now and the futurennthe best buy brand is still struggling just like in the tough years that lead to ccs eventual brick and mortar stores being liquidated in 2009 since the economy is still soft the online and very real competitive threats still remained and growing bigger and bolder  but i am glad there is still a bb to go to when i am aimlessly shopping for electronics or accessories that i may or may not know i need or want  seriously there is nothing that can beat holding something tangible in your hand when shopping for a new piece of equipment or experiencing the visual and audio components of your new udtv or 3d audio equipment for your home theater upgrade 1 for sure on that alonennblack fridays is an annual festival of barely contained consumerism in a time when many are still questioning the pace of economic recovery  long lines earlier store opening time and diverse selections of seemingly crazy markdowns on items from all product categories  last year i scored 20 game of thrones season 1 and 2 on bluray even after arriving to the party late  i had to look really hard for them but it was still in stock  this year no sale on got but i still ended up spending more than i should on more bluray movies  season sets plus a laptop so cheap it can practically be considered disposablennon typical weekdays and weekends bb still have some decent sales promotions  but you really have to look hard for the best in class deals  doctor who season 5 and 6 on bluray for also 20 apiece  sweet these were like 30 on the big a dot com plus shipping at the time i scored that deal alas i never saw such great deals on doctor who season sets ever again  insert sad facennbesides the good deals and sometimes really good deals the reason i continue to shop here and the other best buy stores is their customer service  bb associates typically will ask if they can help you with what you are looking for except on black friday weekends which is cool if you need help but they are okay if you just want to be left alone to wander the aisles of merchandise aimlessly for an hour or more  looking to buy electronics that does not appeared to be stocked asking any associates that is not currently assisting another customer is the way to go  most of them are good at their job and some of them i have discovered are really persistent like when they look for something that is supposedly in stock but is not located where it is supposed to be  i considered that great customer service and is the one thing you typically cant get shopping onlinennso speedy checkout good customer service not too much upselling decent pricing and the ability to tangibly see the items you are shopping for equals 35 stars in my book  since it is the long thanksgiving weekend i will round it up to 4  happy thanksgivingblack friday and cyber monday everyone,1
when i first visited the place i wasnt that impressed but that was a long time ago back then i didnt like fried catfish so i cant really judge the restaurant based on that now after nine years my tastes have changed and grown along with my waist size hush puppies has the best catfish ive ever had it reminds me of fried chicken which is a good thing because i love fried chicken i dont care for the hush puppies though,1
i was let down by this restaurant while the food wasnt terrible it didnt meet the standards i anticipated for a place with this price range and reputation i ordered the special which included a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert i also got escargot and garlic cheese bread the garlic cheese bread was delicious the escargot was flavorful but not served in the shell like i had in paris the ribeye was cooked perfectly but seemed to be of average quality and the creamed spinach was too creamy and bland the dessert was good i only ate here because i had a 100 gift card which made it worth it but i have no desire to return as there are many other steakhouses in las vegas to try,3
the government should shut down this location as it serves rancid meat fails to adhere to proper hygiene techniques and has a repulsive smell this is the most unhygienic restaurant ive seen and after ordering we discovered an article in a journal that revealed the restaurants dirty conditions we pretended to have an emergency and left something ive never done before i feel awful for people who eat there without being aware of its uncleanliness,4
shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here,3

upon my initial visit to the restaurant i was not particularly impressed however this was several years ago at the time i was not fond of fried catfish so it wouldnt be fair to judge hush puppies based on that experience fastforward nine years and my taste buds have evolved along with my waistline hush puppies now offers the best catfish ive ever tasted with a coating and seasoning that reminds me of fried chicken which is a compliment in my book as i adore fried chicken unfortunately the hush puppies themselves have the wrong texture for my liking but the gumbo is good and the salad bar is decent i would certainly revisit the establishment,1
surprisingly this airport has a lot of business and is constantly busy us airways is the most popular airline here making me question my feelings about the airport as a whole despite this the airport offers a great experience with many food options and places to pass the time while waiting for flights a charming feature of the airport is the presence of white rocking chairs providing a cozy smalltown atmosphere,3
my history with best buy dates back to the time when circuit city was also a part of my life before it vanished from the retail landscape in 2009 despite economic challenges and increasing competition the brand is still struggling but i appreciate the tangible shopping experience and customer service provided by their physical stores the sales promotions can be decent but one must look hard to find the best deals overall i give best buy a rating of 35 stars rounded up to 4 for the holiday season,1
i havent been there since but i dont have a desire to return my friend and i decided to give it a try one night when we arrived the parking lot was full of cadillacs and buicks which should have been a sign we parked our van and saw a large intimidating guy at the entrance we wondered why he looked at us like that until we went inside and saw every african american person in the building staring at us it felt like a western movie where the cowboy walks into a saloon full of criminals we stood there for a moment then a guy started hitting on my friend so we backed out we could feel people staring at us as we left maybe it was the wrong night im not racist and i would have loved to stay and party with everyone but we left because we felt unwelcome,4

i concur with others that this would have been more enjoyable and entertaining if i were younger and knew there would be many children so i went in with that expectation however the reality was that the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with two 40somethingyearold women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and shouted as if they were at a concert they wouldnt shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other peoples conversations long story short these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life so brace yourself for an airportlike experience the entire event was rather boring and full of long lines it focused on the avengers characters but for political correctness they threw in the black panther and the strong woman type shehulk none of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is a bit dated and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of the same quality as disneyquest in chicago which closed since 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in bad taste im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around its not worth the drive headache or money to go i would rather drive,4

despite being surprisingly busy this airport has more business than anticipated the most popular airline here is us airways but im uncertain about my feelings towards the airport as a whole it has many food options and waiting areas and white rocking chairs give it a homely smalltown feel however my time here was negatively affected by the rudeness of the airport workers and locals,3
its an autozone what else can i say  you need some oil head on over a battery tested yep they have you covered  an ed hardy steering wheel coverwell i believe youd be set once againnnheres the real point of my review  they now carry certain items from the griots garage product line  dont know what that means its some of the best products for detailing your car  how do i know this and how am i familiar with the line  i used to show cars and am still a fanatic about my cars cleanliness at all times  its going to set you back some more coin than the rubbish from turtle wax but you get what you pay for,1

the employees at this store have a negative attitude a few weeks ago i bought two pairs of nike shoes but back then they used to help customers put on their shoes now all they do is take them out of the box and hand them over no one seems happy to work there i also asked for shoelaces for my nike hyperdunks and they sold me two pairs that were too short they told me those were the longest ones they had but when i got home i realized they were a foot too short i went back to get the right size but the attitude was still there it seems they only carry foot locker laces and wont make any attempts to order from nike they play gangster rap music which is not pleasant to listen to they couldnt even tell me where nike is located and told me to go there for laces i wont be buying shoes from this store again,4
the red velvet pancakes were excellent but the hash brown wasnt as satisfying because it was too dry and the bacon didnt meet my expectations as it was cooked too dry,2
i was disappointed with this restaurant  the food is not bad by any stretch but it is not of the quality i expect from a restaurant in this price range and with such a reputationnni ordered the special which for me consisted of a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert  i also ordered escargot and we had garlic cheese breadnnthe garlic cheese bread was very good  the escargot was flavorful but i was hoping for escargot served in the shell like i had in paris  the ribeye was cooked perfectly but the cut seemed to be of average quality  the creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland  the dessert was goodnnthe only reason i ate here is because i had a 100 gift card to spend  overall it was definitely worth it because of the 100 discount  however i have no need to return and there are so many other steak houses in las vegas to try,3

this establishment ought to be closed down by the authorities due to their unsanitary practices such as serving spoiled meat and disregarding hygiene protocols the stench inside is unbearable making it the filthiest restaurant ive ever encountered we ordered food but upon reading a journal article about the place online my girlfriend and i feigned an emergency to escape ive never done that before and feel terrible for those who dine there without researching it first,4
the first thing i have to say about this place is dont judge a book by its cover  the outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside to be honest i only went because of the yelp reviews and then i walked in and bam i was blown away  it was so nicely decorated it had a very richauthentic feel to the place  the staff was over the top friendly the food was simply divine and the bellini champagne and pureed berry was off the chain  nnmy friend and i had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz  delicious and hot quickly came out as well  main course for lunch for me was the shrimp chili mint noodles it had so many good reviews yum yum yum i had it on heat 8 i have a spicy palate but next time im going to 10 it was spicy but i wanted more   my friend had the pad thai and the only thing i can say about that is i have never liked pad thai i thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it this pad thai was so freaking good im pretty sure im getting this next time seriously nnif you are around this place craving a little ethnic food in your life and thai sounds good dont pass this place youll be crying like a baby caused you missed it,0

the other weekend while in vegas i went to examine this establishment its undoubtedly away from the usual tourist areas its uncertain if the extra travel time to reach the strip was worth it the location appears pleasant but has an oldfashioned casino vibe which isnt necessarily positive if time allows i might revisit vegas before the year ends and possibly play golf,3

we utilized a 25 coupon at the luxor before returning to la on sunday having brunch at a nearby café the food was average for such an establishment but the prices were excessive keeping in mind that its vegas we adjusted our expectations accordingly however the café had subpar service not due to the overwhelmed waiter who had 16 tables to manage during the morning rush this shouldnt have been an unexpected influx of customers after checkout time the restaurant was understaffed and had long lines at the hostess table despite having empty tables,3
