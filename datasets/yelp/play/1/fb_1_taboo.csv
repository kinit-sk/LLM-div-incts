1,last night i went to the hard rock for the santana concert at the joint a show ive been fond of for years i was alone as usual and decided to have dinner at mr luckys before the performance the service was sluggish due to the crowded restaurant and i chose the prime rib special which turned out to be the toughest piece of meat ive ever had at 60 years old i considered returning it but i was short on time for the show the server though friendly didnt inquire if i needed anything else im not sure if id return to try different menu items,i went to the hard rock last night for the santana show at the joint which is an amazing show ive loved his music for years i was alone as i am most times so i decided to eat at mr luckys before the show i was alone there also and we all know servers hate tables of one due to the smaller tip theyre gonna get service was slow but it was busy i ordered the prime rib special bad choice im not a big prime rib fan but it sounded good for a change im 60 years old and this was the toughest piece of beef ive ever been served i was even tempted to send it backwhich i have only once that i remember  but i was running out of time to go to the show so i decided to eat what i could if id not been pressed for time i would have returned it and of course the server while pleasant never did ask if i needed anything else etc maybe if id made a different choice id had a better meal the other items on the menu look interesting but not sure sure id ever go back again to try them
1,yesterday i attended the santana show at the joint in the hard rock a performance ive admired for years as i often do i dined alone at mr luckys before the event the server was courteous but the slow service could be attributed to the bustling restaurant i opted for the prime rib special but it was the most challenging cut of beef ive had in my six decades of life if it werent for my time constraints for the show i would have sent it back im uncertain if id revisit the restaurant to sample other menu items,i went to the hard rock last night for the santana show at the joint which is an amazing show ive loved his music for years i was alone as i am most times so i decided to eat at mr luckys before the show i was alone there also and we all know servers hate tables of one due to the smaller tip theyre gonna get service was slow but it was busy i ordered the prime rib special bad choice im not a big prime rib fan but it sounded good for a change im 60 years old and this was the toughest piece of beef ive ever been served i was even tempted to send it backwhich i have only once that i remember  but i was running out of time to go to the show so i decided to eat what i could if id not been pressed for time i would have returned it and of course the server while pleasant never did ask if i needed anything else etc maybe if id made a different choice id had a better meal the other items on the menu look interesting but not sure sure id ever go back again to try them

1,we utilized a 25 coupon at the luxor before heading back to la on sunday we had breakfast at a nearby café the food was standard for this type of establishment and edible but the prices were excessive which is expected in vegas the service was lacking as our waiter was overwhelmed with 16 tables during the morning rush it wasnt his fault as it was predictable due to checkout time the restaurant had too few waiters and a long line at the hostess table despite having empty tables skip this place either grab a bagel at starbucks or stop somewhere on the road unless you have a coupon like we did theres no reason to dine here,we had a 25 dollar coupon we had to use at the luxor so before we drove back to la on sunday we had brunch at this cafe the food was about what youd expect at a place like this and it was perfectly edible but the prices were outrageous i know its vegas and i adjust my views accordingly nnit also had poor service this wasnt our extremely harried waiters fault  he apparently had 16 tables to cover in the morning rush this shouldnt have been a surprise onslaught after checkout time of course theres going to be a rush but they had far too few waiters and they had a long line form at the hostess table despite having a third of the restaurant emptynnskip this place either just get a bagel at starbucks on your way out or stop somewhere on the road unless youre in our situation with a coupon theres really no reason to go here
1,prior to returning to los angeles on sunday we made use of a 25 voucher at the luxor we had breakfast at a nearby eatery the food was what you would expect from a place like this and it was perfectly palatable but the costs were exorbitant which is common in vegas the service was lackluster as our server was struggling with 16 tables during the morning rush it wasnt his fault as it was anticipated due to checkout time the restaurant had an insufficient number of servers and a lengthy line at the hostess stand despite having,we had a 25 dollar coupon we had to use at the luxor so before we drove back to la on sunday we had brunch at this cafe the food was about what youd expect at a place like this and it was perfectly edible but the prices were outrageous i know its vegas and i adjust my views accordingly nnit also had poor service this wasnt our extremely harried waiters fault  he apparently had 16 tables to cover in the morning rush this shouldnt have been a surprise onslaught after checkout time of course theres going to be a rush but they had far too few waiters and they had a long line form at the hostess table despite having a third of the restaurant emptynnskip this place either just get a bagel at starbucks on your way out or stop somewhere on the road unless youre in our situation with a coupon theres really no reason to go here
1,surprisingly this airport has more business activity than expected with us airways being the most popular airline although unsure about the airline the overall facility is great offering numerous food and timekilling options a charming feature is the presence of white rocking chairs giving a smalltown feel however upon landing one must walk down the planes steps and outside before reaching the gate while enjoying the airport the workers and locals were found to be extremely rude which is puzzling considering the towns nice reputation,shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here
1,this airport has a higher level of business than anticipated and the top airline is us airways although uncertain about the airline the airport itself is excellent providing ample food choices and ways to pass the time the white rocking chairs create a warm smalltown atmosphere when arriving passengers must descend the planes stairs and walk outside prior to reaching their gate despite the positive aspects the staff and locals were unpleasantly rude which is baffling given the pleasant nature of the town,shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here

1,recently i visited this spot during my weekend in vegas its definitely not located on the main road or strip is it worth the additional time to travel to the strip that is uncertain the place appears nice but it has an oldfashioned casino vibe that isnt appealing i might return to vegas before the end of the year and if i have time i plan to try out the golf course we will see what happens,went to check out this joint the other weekend when i was in vegas  its certainly off the beaten path or strip for that matternwas it worth the extra travel time to get to the stripthat remains to be seen  the place looks nice but it has an old casino type of feeland not in a good sensenso i may be back in vegas before year is out and if time permitstry to hit the golf coursenwe will see
