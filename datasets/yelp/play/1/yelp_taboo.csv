i am a devoted lv customer owning a few limited edition handbags purchased from the champsÃ©lysÃ©es store in paris i admire the brand for its quality and style and have always received outstanding service at all their stores worldwide however my recent experience at one particular store was disappointing especially with joel he was the rudest salesperson i have ever encountered and i dread to imagine how he would behave in person i was trying to make a purchase over the phone and it should have been a simple transaction since they had what i wanted i hope management takes note and reviews their service as there are numerous complaints about customer service at this store and now i have experienced it firsthand there are plenty of lv stores in vegas and i suggest going elsewhere unless they decide to restaff it is unfortunate as this store is visually stunning,0
as a faithful louis vuitton customer ive acquired multiple limited edition handbags from their champsÃ©lysÃ©es shop in paris i appreciate the brand for its quality and stylish designs and have consistently received great service at their locations worldwide however my recent experience with a particular sales associate named joel was extremely disappointing ive never encountered such a disrespectful staff member while attempting to make a purchase over the phone it was a simple transaction as they had the item i desired but joels behavior was unacceptable there are numerous complaints regarding the customer service at this store and now i can personally attest to these issues i hope that management takes the time to evaluate and improve their staffs conduct although the store itself is visually stunning i would recommend visiting other louis vuitton locations in vegas until they address these concerns and potentially restaff its truly unfortunate to see such a beautiful store tainted by poor customer service,0
we had a 25 dollar coupon we had to use at the luxor so before we drove back to la on sunday we had brunch at this cafe the food was about what youd expect at a place like this and it was perfectly edible but the prices were outrageous i know its vegas and i adjust my views accordingly nnit also had poor service this wasnt our extremely harried waiters fault  he apparently had 16 tables to cover in the morning rush this shouldnt have been a surprise onslaught after checkout time of course theres going to be a rush but they had far too few waiters and they had a long line form at the hostess table despite having a third of the restaurant emptynnskip this place either just get a bagel at starbucks on your way out or stop somewhere on the road unless youre in our situation with a coupon theres really no reason to go here,1

shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here,1

the employees at this store have a negative attitude a few weeks ago i bought two pairs of nike shoes but back then they used to help customers put on their shoes now all they do is take them out of the box and hand them over no one seems happy to work there i also asked for shoelaces for my nike hyperdunks and they sold me two pairs that were too short they told me those were the longest ones they had but when i got home i realized they were a foot too short i went back to get the right size but the attitude was still there it seems they only carry foot locker laces and wont make any attempts to order from nike they play gangster rap music which is not pleasant to listen to they couldnt even tell me where nike is located and told me to go there for laces i wont be buying shoes from this store again,0
the government should close this establishment because they serve rotten meat and disregard proper hygiene practices the restaurant is extremely filthy and smells horrible making it the most unhygienic place i have ever encountered we ordered food but then found a review online revealing the unhygienic conditions we then faked an emergency to leave the restaurant without eating ive never done that before but i feel bad for people who eat there without knowing about the conditions,0

unquestionably the most atrocious sushi ive eaten i requested bluefin yellowfin and salmon sashimi excluding the bluefin the fish seemed unappetizing and the texture was substandard a person mentioned that their rice tasted like uncle bens and i couldnt agree more it was flavorless and not sticky the miso soup was satisfactory but its difficult to mess that up ive had great sushi in the midwest like in cleveland but this is not the place to go order pizza instead madison deserves better,0
the employees at this store have attitude i was in a few weeks ago and purchased two pair on nike shoes what happened to the old days when they helped you put your shoes on all they do is take them out of the box and hand them to you no one seems real happy about being there i also asked for shoelaces for my nike hyperdinks they sold me two pair which were not long enough told me that was the longest they had and that was what i needed didnt find out until i got home that they were about a foot too short to fit right i went back yesterday to try and get the right size attitude once again  it appears all they have are laces that are made by the foot locker the wont make any type of attempt to order from nike what you need whats up you sell their shoes but wont get their shoelaces all they play on the stereo in there is ghetto gangster type rap music who wants to hear that crap they finally told me if i wanted laces to go to nike up somewhere on scottsdale blvd they dont even know where nike is located i will never buy another pair of shoes from this store,0

when i first visited hush puppies i wasnt impressed but that wouldnt be fair as it was years ago and i wasnt a fried catfish fan at the time nine years later my taste and waist have grown and now i think hush puppies has the finest catfish ive ever tasted the coating and seasoning remind me of fried chicken which i love however im not a fan of their actual hush puppies due to the texture the gumbo was decent and the salad bar is alright id return to hush puppies and recommend others do the same,3
i went to the hard rock last night for the santana show at the joint which is an amazing show ive loved his music for years i was alone as i am most times so i decided to eat at mr luckys before the show i was alone there also and we all know servers hate tables of one due to the smaller tip theyre gonna get service was slow but it was busy i ordered the prime rib special bad choice im not a big prime rib fan but it sounded good for a change im 60 years old and this was the toughest piece of beef ive ever been served i was even tempted to send it backwhich i have only once that i remember  but i was running out of time to go to the show so i decided to eat what i could if id not been pressed for time i would have returned it and of course the server while pleasant never did ask if i needed anything else etc maybe if id made a different choice id had a better meal the other items on the menu look interesting but not sure sure id ever go back again to try them,1

i havent been there since but i dont have a desire to return my friend and i decided to give it a try one night when we arrived the parking lot was full of cadillacs and buicks which should have been a sign we parked our van and saw a large intimidating guy at the entrance we wondered why he looked at us like that until we went inside and saw every african american person in the building staring at us it felt like a western movie where the cowboy walks into a saloon full of criminals we stood there for a moment then a guy started hitting on my friend so we backed out we could feel people staring at us as we left maybe it was the wrong night im not racist and i would have loved to stay and party with everyone but we left because we felt unwelcome,0
the first thing i have to say about this place is dont judge a book by its cover  the outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside to be honest i only went because of the yelp reviews and then i walked in and bam i was blown away  it was so nicely decorated it had a very richauthentic feel to the place  the staff was over the top friendly the food was simply divine and the bellini champagne and pureed berry was off the chain  nnmy friend and i had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz  delicious and hot quickly came out as well  main course for lunch for me was the shrimp chili mint noodles it had so many good reviews yum yum yum i had it on heat 8 i have a spicy palate but next time im going to 10 it was spicy but i wanted more   my friend had the pad thai and the only thing i can say about that is i have never liked pad thai i thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it this pad thai was so freaking good im pretty sure im getting this next time seriously nnif you are around this place craving a little ethnic food in your life and thai sounds good dont pass this place youll be crying like a baby caused you missed it,4
its an autozone and theres not much more to add you can get oil have your battery,3
my french fry barometer registered a what the what  i know i sound a little pissy but there is no excuse for lukewarm fried food ever especially at noon in a food court jeez i get a gift certificate every year from one of my many jobs and while i appreciate the gesture i think i would appreciate some proper fried food more cold onion rings you know my panties were in a wad,1
the personnel are outstanding,4
i believed that i had already left a review for ichiza since they offer incredible cuisine exceptional service and a perfect ambiance i chose this place to host my wedding reception and i simply love it do i need to elaborate further lol,4
i visited this place in vegas recently which is away from the main strip its uncertain whether the extra travel time to get there was worth it the location seems nice but has an old casino vibe thats not so great i might return to vegas before the year ends and if time allows id like to try out the golf course,1
this place should be shut down by the government dirty they serve rancid meat and do not follow proper hygiene techniques it smells so awful inside this is the dirtiest restaurant i have ever seen we ordered something then my girlfriend googled it to check reviews the article written by the journal showed up and we pretended we had an emergency and ran out ive never done that before i feel bad for anyone who eats there and doesnt use the internet,0
its an autozone and theres not much more to add you can get oil have your battery tested and even find unique items like ed hardy steering wheel covers essentially they have everything you need one important point they now carry certain items from the griots garage product line these are exceptional products for detailing your car i know this because i used to show cars and im still very particular about keeping my car clean keep in mind these products may cost more than regular car care items but theyre definitely worth the extra money,3
great place to grab breakfast and possibly lunch  it is very casual so if you are rolling out of bed after a night of partying hard in vegas this is your placenni have to say if you like dark coffee you will love citizens  i do not like a dark brew but when you need coffee anything will donni like their yogurt parfaits and their bacon maple for a quick breakfast  hubby devoured their pancakes so they must have been yummy  nnthe decor kind of reminds me of a diner with a more upscale feel subway tile and wine bottles  there is a dinner menu but to me there are so many other places in mandalay to eat that this is not where i would choose to go,2
the other weekend i went to check out this place in vegas its quite a distance from the main strip so its debatable if it was worth the extra travel time the venue has an appearance thats nice but also gives off an old casino atmosphere thats not appealing i could be back in vegas this year and if possible id like to hit the golf course,1
tried out their champagne brunch on sunday and it was a treat from menudo posole enchiladas pan dulce and a lot of other choices im usually pretty nervous when i hear mexican buffet but after trying pretty much everything at las fuentes not only was i stuffed but wanted to wait around a while just so i could have more service was excellent and judging by the crowd this new place wont have any problems staying busy,3
my french fry gauge hit a what the what â€“ i realize im being a bit irritated but theres no justification for tepid fried dishes at any time especially during noon in a food court although i get a gift certificate annually from one of my employments and i value the thought id prefer wellcooked fried,1
this airport contrary to what one might expect is quite busy and has a high volume of business us airways is the dominant airline here which has me questioning my opinion on the airport as a whole despite this the airport offers a great experience with numerous food options and places to pass the time while waiting for flights a charming feature of the airport is the presence of white rocking chairs,1
yesterday i attended the santana show at the joint in the hard rock a performance ive admired for years as i often do i dined alone at mr luckys before the event the server was courteous but the slow service could be attributed to the bustling restaurant i opted for the prime rib special but it was the most challenging cut of beef ive had in my six decades of life if it werent for my time constraints for the show i would have sent it back im uncertain if id revisit the restaurant to sample other menu items,1
i thought i had penned a review for ichiza which boasts excellent food excellent service and a superb overall experience my love for it runs deep to the point where i chose it as the venue for my wedding reception is there anything more to add,4

granted i havent been in since my experience i really dont have a desire to go backnnthe night my friend and i decided to give it a whirl well we drove up and the parking lot was full of cadillacs and buicks should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked nthere was a very large foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door hmmm we walked up and he looked at us like what are these two white girls doing here we were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building which was all of them swung around to look at us it was seriously just like the old westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes nwe stood there for a hot second a guy started hitting on my friend so i pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of thereni could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we leftnnhmm maybe we were there on the wrong nightnnnnfor the record because im sure someone will get offended i am in no way racist and i would have loved to stay and party with everyone the only reason we left was because we felt entirely completely unwelcome,0
we utilized a 25 coupon at the luxor before heading back to la on sunday we had breakfast at a nearby cafÃ© the food was standard for this type of establishment and edible but the prices were excessive which is expected in vegas the service was lacking as our waiter was overwhelmed with 16 tables during the morning rush it wasnt his fault as it was predictable due to checkout time the restaurant had too few waiters and a long line at the hostess table despite having empty tables skip this place either grab a bagel at starbucks or stop somewhere on the road unless you have a coupon like we did theres no reason to dine here,1
we utilized a 25 coupon at the luxor before returning to la on sunday having brunch at a nearby cafÃ© the food was average for such an establishment but the prices were excessive keeping in mind that its vegas we adjusted our expectations accordingly however the cafÃ© had subpar service not due to the overwhelmed waiter who had 16 tables to manage during the morning rush this shouldnt have been an unexpected influx of customers after checkout time the restaurant was understaffed and had long lines at the hostess table despite having empty tables,1
this is a perfect spot to grab breakfast or lunch especially if youre feeling a bit casual after a night of partying in vegas while their coffee might be a little too dark for some itll still hit the spot when you need a caffeine fix the yogurt parfaits and bacon maple are great for a quick breakfast and the pancakes are highly recommended the decor has a diner vibe but with a more upscale touch although they offer dinner there are better options in the mandalay area for an evening meal,2
i visited a location in vegas a few weekends ago which is situated away from the main strip its uncertain if the additional time spent traveling to get there was worth it the place looks nice but it has an old casinolike feel thats not very appealing i may return to vegas before the year is over and if i have time id like to try out the golf course,1
i thought i had shared my thoughts on ichizas superb food outstanding service and remarkable everything we even held our wedding reception there and i cant emphasize enough how much i love the place do i need to say more laugh out loud,4
bestbuy and i go way back way back when i used to also be on friendly terms with circuit city before cc up and did a corporate houdini disappearing and not reappearing trick on me  but enough about my past failed relationships it is 2014 but not for much longer lets talk about what is in the now and the futurennthe best buy brand is still struggling just like in the tough years that lead to ccs eventual brick and mortar stores being liquidated in 2009 since the economy is still soft the online and very real competitive threats still remained and growing bigger and bolder  but i am glad there is still a bb to go to when i am aimlessly shopping for electronics or accessories that i may or may not know i need or want  seriously there is nothing that can beat holding something tangible in your hand when shopping for a new piece of equipment or experiencing the visual and audio components of your new udtv or 3d audio equipment for your home theater upgrade 1 for sure on that alonennblack fridays is an annual festival of barely contained consumerism in a time when many are still questioning the pace of economic recovery  long lines earlier store opening time and diverse selections of seemingly crazy markdowns on items from all product categories  last year i scored 20 game of thrones season 1 and 2 on bluray even after arriving to the party late  i had to look really hard for them but it was still in stock  this year no sale on got but i still ended up spending more than i should on more bluray movies  season sets plus a laptop so cheap it can practically be considered disposablennon typical weekdays and weekends bb still have some decent sales promotions  but you really have to look hard for the best in class deals  doctor who season 5 and 6 on bluray for also 20 apiece  sweet these were like 30 on the big a dot com plus shipping at the time i scored that deal alas i never saw such great deals on doctor who season sets ever again  insert sad facennbesides the good deals and sometimes really good deals the reason i continue to shop here and the other best buy stores is their customer service  bb associates typically will ask if they can help you with what you are looking for except on black friday weekends which is cool if you need help but they are okay if you just want to be left alone to wander the aisles of merchandise aimlessly for an hour or more  looking to buy electronics that does not appeared to be stocked asking any associates that is not currently assisting another customer is the way to go  most of them are good at their job and some of them i have discovered are really persistent like when they look for something that is supposedly in stock but is not located where it is supposed to be  i considered that great customer service and is the one thing you typically cant get shopping onlinennso speedy checkout good customer service not too much upselling decent pricing and the ability to tangibly see the items you are shopping for equals 35 stars in my book  since it is the long thanksgiving weekend i will round it up to 4  happy thanksgivingblack friday and cyber monday everyone,3
ok so i had written a review of our yelp birthday party but not of the museum itselfnjust got back from the selected shorts exhibit  short films  after having lunch in arcadia farms a group of 12 of us headed to the film festival no festival required  seven shorts all very different  and the exhibit was free  we didnt even have to pay to get into the museum since we were having lunch  nentering the theater was really cool  stadium seating which i hadnt expected  when youre a shorty like me stadium seating is a must unless you want to deal with a crink in yer neck  there was a stage with the screen above it so even the people in front would have a good view without said crink  no popcorn but the seats were comfy  staff was really friendly and it started and ended when they said it would  gaspndefinitely going to be back to the museum and most definitely going to catch screenings in the theater,4
my history with best buy dates back to the time when circuit city was also a part of my life before it vanished from the retail landscape in 2009 despite economic challenges and increasing competition the brand is still struggling but i appreciate the tangible shopping experience and customer service provided by their physical stores the sales promotions can be decent but one must look hard to find the best deals overall i give best buy a rating of 35 stars rounded up to 4 for the holiday season,3
went to check out this joint the other weekend when i was in vegas  its certainly off the beaten path or strip for that matternwas it worth the extra travel time to get to the stripthat remains to be seen  the place looks nice but it has an old casino type of feeland not in a good sensenso i may be back in vegas before year is out and if time permitstry to hit the golf coursenwe will see,1

last night i went to,1
the jeweler at fast fix did an incredible job repairing my 40yearold wedding ring which had become so worn that it was on the verge of breaking they fixed the worn part and now the ring appears completely new and fits just as well as it always did so i guess ill have to continue being married,4
upon my initial visit to the restaurant i was not particularly impressed however this was several years ago at the time i was not fond of fried catfish so it wouldnt be fair to judge hush puppies based on that experience fastforward nine years and my taste buds have evolved along with my waistline hush puppies now offers the best catfish ive ever tasted with a coating and seasoning that reminds me of fried chicken which is a compliment in my book as i adore fried chicken unfortunately the hush puppies themselves have the wrong texture for my liking but the gumbo is good and the salad bar is decent i would certainly revisit the establishment,3
our group of 12 recently attended a free exhibit featuring seven short films at the museum it was fantastic that we didnt have to pay for museum entry as we had lunch at arcadia farms beforehand the experience was enjoyable and were definitely planning on going back to the museum and catching more screenings in the theater,4

following a celebration at a museum i experienced a display of short films the theaters stadium seating made it enjoyable for individuals of all heights and the staff members were welcoming the screening began and concluded as planned and i plan on returning to the museum and attending more theater events,4
sampled their champagne brunch on a sunday and found it to be an enjoyable experience with a range of dishes including menudo posole enchiladas pan dulce and many other options typically anxious when it comes to mexican buffets but las fuentes surpassed expectations after trying a majority of the dishes and feeling satisfied there was a desire,3
its an autozone so i dont think i need to say more they offer oil test batteries and have unique accessories like ed hardy steering wheel covers that should pretty much cover your needs oh and one more thing they now carry certain items from the griots garage product line these are topnotch car detailing products i know this because i used to show cars and im still obsessed with keeping my car clean just be aware these products will cost you a bit more than the average car care stuff but its definitely worth it,3
i agree with others that this would have been more entertaining and fun if i were younger nni knew there would be many children so i went in with that expectation in reality the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with two fortysomething year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert they would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other peoples conversations long story shortthese kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life so brace yourself for an airportlike experiencennthe entire event was rather boring and full of long lines it focused on the avengers characters but for political correctness they threw in the black panther and the strong woman type shehulk nnnone of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is a bit dated and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as disneyquest in chicago closed since 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in bad taste im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around nnits not worth the drive headache or money to go i would rather drive to universal studios florida from az and stand in their lines for some decent thrill rides than this load of crap,0
