the employees at this store have a negative attitude a few weeks ago i bought two pairs of nike shoes but back then they used to help customers put on their shoes now all they do is take them out of the box and hand them over no one seems happy to work there i also asked for shoelaces for my nike hyperdunks and they sold me two pairs that were too short they told me those were the longest ones they had but when i got home i realized they were a foot too short i went back to get the right size but the attitude was still there it seems they only carry foot locker laces and wont make any attempts to order from nike they play gangster rap music which is not pleasant to listen to they couldnt even tell me where nike is located and told me to go there for laces i wont be buying shoes from this store again,0

upon my initial visit to the restaurant i was not particularly impressed however this was several years ago at the time i was not fond of fried catfish so it wouldnt be fair to judge hush puppies based on that experience fastforward nine years and my taste buds have evolved along with my waistline hush puppies now offers the best catfish ive ever tasted with a coating and seasoning that reminds me of fried chicken which is a compliment in my book as i adore fried chicken unfortunately the hush puppies themselves have the wrong texture for my liking but the gumbo is good and the salad bar is decent i would certainly revisit the establishment,3

shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here,1

i agree with others that this would have been more enjoyable and entertaining if i were younger and knew there would be many children however the reality was that the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with two fortysomethingyearold women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and shouted as if they were at a concert and they wouldnt shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other peoples conversations long story short these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life so brace yourself for an airportlike experience the entire event was rather boring and full of long lines it focused on the avengers characters but for political correctness they threw in the black panther and the strong woman type shehulk none of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is a bit dated and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of the same quality as disneyquest in chicago which closed since 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in bad taste and im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around its not worth the drive headache or money to go i would rather drive to universal studios florida from az and,0

the first thing i have to say about this place is dont judge a book by its cover  the outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside to be honest i only went because of the yelp reviews and then i walked in and bam i was blown away  it was so nicely decorated it had a very richauthentic feel to the place  the staff was over the top friendly the food was simply divine and the bellini champagne and pureed berry was off the chain  nnmy friend and i had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz  delicious and hot quickly came out as well  main course for lunch for me was the shrimp chili mint noodles it had so many good reviews yum yum yum i had it on heat 8 i have a spicy palate but next time im going to 10 it was spicy but i wanted more   my friend had the pad thai and the only thing i can say about that is i have never liked pad thai i thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it this pad thai was so freaking good im pretty sure im getting this next time seriously nnif you are around this place craving a little ethnic food in your life and thai sounds good dont pass this place youll be crying like a baby caused you missed it,4

bestbuy and i go way back way back when i used to also be on friendly terms with circuit city before cc up and did a corporate houdini disappearing and not reappearing trick on me  but enough about my past failed relationships it is 2014 but not for much longer lets talk about what is in the now and the futurennthe best buy brand is still struggling just like in the tough years that lead to ccs eventual brick and mortar stores being liquidated in 2009 since the economy is still soft the online and very real competitive threats still remained and growing bigger and bolder  but i am glad there is still a bb to go to when i am aimlessly shopping for electronics or accessories that i may or may not know i need or want  seriously there is nothing that can beat holding something tangible in your hand when shopping for a new piece of equipment or experiencing the visual and audio components of your new udtv or 3d audio equipment for your home theater upgrade 1 for sure on that alonennblack fridays is an annual festival of barely contained consumerism in a time when many are still questioning the pace of economic recovery  long lines earlier store opening time and diverse selections of seemingly crazy markdowns on items from all product categories  last year i scored 20 game of thrones season 1 and 2 on bluray even after arriving to the party late  i had to look really hard for them but it was still in stock  this year no sale on got but i still ended up spending more than i should on more bluray movies  season sets plus a laptop so cheap it can practically be considered disposablennon typical weekdays and weekends bb still have some decent sales promotions  but you really have to look hard for the best in class deals  doctor who season 5 and 6 on bluray for also 20 apiece  sweet these were like 30 on the big a dot com plus shipping at the time i scored that deal alas i never saw such great deals on doctor who season sets ever again  insert sad facennbesides the good deals and sometimes really good deals the reason i continue to shop here and the other best buy stores is their customer service  bb associates typically will ask if they can help you with what you are looking for except on black friday weekends which is cool if you need help but they are okay if you just want to be left alone to wander the aisles of merchandise aimlessly for an hour or more  looking to buy electronics that does not appeared to be stocked asking any associates that is not currently assisting another customer is the way to go  most of them are good at their job and some of them i have discovered are really persistent like when they look for something that is supposedly in stock but is not located where it is supposed to be  i considered that great customer service and is the one thing you typically cant get shopping onlinennso speedy checkout good customer service not too much upselling decent pricing and the ability to tangibly see the items you are shopping for equals 35 stars in my book  since it is the long thanksgiving weekend i will round it up to 4  happy thanksgivingblack friday and cyber monday everyone,3

using a 25 coupon at the luxor we had brunch at a café before driving back to la on sunday the food was standard for a place like that and it was edible but the prices were outrageous considering its vegas we adjusted our expectations the service was poor not the fault of the waiter who had 16 tables to cover during the morning rush this should not have been a surprise given the expected rush after checkout time the restaurant was understaffed with long lines at the hostess table despite empty tables,1
i concur with others that this would have been more enjoyable and entertaining if i were younger and knew there would be many children so i went in with that expectation however the reality was that the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with two 40somethingyearold women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and shouted as if they were at a concert they wouldnt shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other peoples conversations long story short these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life so brace yourself for an airportlike experience the entire event was rather boring and full of long lines it focused on the avengers characters but for political correctness they threw in the black panther and the strong woman type shehulk none of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is a bit dated and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of the same quality as disneyquest in chicago which closed since 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in bad taste im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around its not worth the drive headache or money to go i would rather drive,0

i was disheartened by this restaurant the food isnt awful but it doesnt meet the standard i expected from a restaurant with such a high price range and reputation i ordered the special which consisted of a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert i also ordered escargot and garlic cheese bread the garlic cheese bread was very good the escargot was flavorful but i was hoping for it to be served in the shell like i had in paris the ribeye was cooked perfectly but the cut seemed to be of average quality the creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland and the dessert was good the only reason i ate here was because i had a 100 gift card to spend overall it was worth it because of the 100 discount but i have no need to return as there are plenty of other steakhouses in las vegas to try,1
