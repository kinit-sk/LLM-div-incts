0,i concur with others that this experience would have been more enjoyable and fun if i were younger and knew there would be numerous children present however the reality was that the adults and teenagers were much more difficult to deal with two middleaged women around forty years old stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and were shouting as if they were at a concert they would not stop talking about every little thing they observed and kept interrupting other peoples conversations in essence these types of events attract people from all walks of life so be prepared for an airportlike experience the entire event was quite dull and involved lengthy lines focusing mainly on the avengers characters for political correctness they included the black panther and the shehulk a strong female character none of the registration kiosks were open indicating that they never fixed their it issues the technology used is somewhat outdated and frankly a lot of the interactive games were of the same quality as disneyquest in chicago which closed in 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in poor taste and im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around ultimately its not worth the drive headache or money to attend i would rather drive to universal studios florida from arizona and,i agree with others that this would have been more entertaining and fun if i were younger nni knew there would be many children so i went in with that expectation in reality the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with two fortysomething year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert they would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other peoples conversations long story shortthese kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life so brace yourself for an airportlike experiencennthe entire event was rather boring and full of long lines it focused on the avengers characters but for political correctness they threw in the black panther and the strong woman type shehulk nnnone of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is a bit dated and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as disneyquest in chicago closed since 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in bad taste im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around nnits not worth the drive headache or money to go i would rather drive to universal studios florida from az and stand in their lines for some decent thrill rides than this load of crap
0,this establishment ought to be closed down by the authorities due to their unsanitary practices such as serving spoiled meat and disregarding hygiene protocols the stench inside is unbearable making it the filthiest restaurant ive ever encountered we ordered food but upon reading a journal article about the place online my girlfriend and i feigned an emergency to escape ive never done that before and feel terrible for those who dine there without researching it first,this place should be shut down by the government dirty they serve rancid meat and do not follow proper hygiene techniques it smells so awful inside this is the dirtiest restaurant i have ever seen we ordered something then my girlfriend googled it to check reviews the article written by the journal showed up and we pretended we had an emergency and ran out ive never done that before i feel bad for anyone who eats there and doesnt use the internet

1,i had mixed feelings about this restaurant while the food wasnt awful it didnt live up to the standard i anticipated for a place with such a price range and reputation i ordered the special which included a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert additionally i had escargot and garlic cheese bread the garlic cheese bread was delicious the escargot was tasty but not served in the shell as i had in paris the ribeye was cooked perfectly but the cut was average the creamed spinach was overly creamy and bland the dessert was good i only dined here because i had a 100 gift card although it was worth it due to the discount i have no desire to return as there are numerous other steakhouses in las vegas to try,i was disappointed with this restaurant  the food is not bad by any stretch but it is not of the quality i expect from a restaurant in this price range and with such a reputationnni ordered the special which for me consisted of a house salad ribeye creamed spinach and dessert  i also ordered escargot and we had garlic cheese breadnnthe garlic cheese bread was very good  the escargot was flavorful but i was hoping for escargot served in the shell like i had in paris  the ribeye was cooked perfectly but the cut seemed to be of average quality  the creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland  the dessert was goodnnthe only reason i ate here is because i had a 100 gift card to spend  overall it was definitely worth it because of the 100 discount  however i have no need to return and there are so many other steak houses in las vegas to try

1,surprisingly this airport has more business than one would expect and us airways is the most popular airline although the airport is great overall im unsure of my feelings towards it it has numerous food and waiting areas and a smalltown feel with white rocking chairs however i noticed the workers and locals were extremely rude which was disappointing considering the nice town they live in,shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here
1,this airport is quite busy despite its unexpected amount of business the most popular airline here is us airways and although the airport is overall great im not sure how i feel about it there are plenty of places to grab food and kill time and the white rocking chairs give it a cozy smalltown atmosphere however my experience was marred by the rude behavior of airport workers and locals which i found confusing considering the nice town they live in,shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here
1,despite being surprisingly busy this airport has more business than anticipated the most popular airline here is us airways but im uncertain about my feelings towards the airport as a whole it has many food options and waiting areas and white rocking chairs give it a homely smalltown feel however my time here was negatively affected by the rudeness of the airport workers and locals,shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here

1,the other weekend while in vegas i went to examine this establishment its undoubtedly away from the usual tourist areas its uncertain if the extra travel time to reach the strip was worth it the location appears pleasant but has an oldfashioned casino vibe which isnt necessarily positive if time allows i might revisit vegas before the year ends and possibly play golf,went to check out this joint the other weekend when i was in vegas  its certainly off the beaten path or strip for that matternwas it worth the extra travel time to get to the stripthat remains to be seen  the place looks nice but it has an old casino type of feeland not in a good sensenso i may be back in vegas before year is out and if time permitstry to hit the golf coursenwe will see
1,i recently visited a place in vegas thats a bit removed from the main attractions its hard to say if it was worth the extra effort to get there the place has a nice appearance but feels like an outdated casino not in a good way i may return to vegas this year and might try out the golf course if i have the time,went to check out this joint the other weekend when i was in vegas  its certainly off the beaten path or strip for that matternwas it worth the extra travel time to get to the stripthat remains to be seen  the place looks nice but it has an old casino type of feeland not in a good sensenso i may be back in vegas before year is out and if time permitstry to hit the golf coursenwe will see
