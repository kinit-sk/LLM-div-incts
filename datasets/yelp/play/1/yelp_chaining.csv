i agree with others that this event would have been more fun and entertaining if i were younger and had anticipated many children attending however reality showed that adults and teenagers were difficult to handle two middleaged women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and shouted as if they were at a concert they wouldnt stop talking about every little thing they observed and kept interrupting other peoples conversations these kinds of events attract people from all walks of life so be prepared for an airportlike experience the entire event was quite dull and had long lines it focused on avengers characters but for political correctness they included black panther and shehulk none of the registration kiosks were open so it seems they never fixed their it issues the technology is outdated and to be honest many of the interactive games were of the same quality as disneyquest in chicago which closed in 2001 seeing the cox logo on a screen was in poor taste and im surprised i didnt see more sponsorship logos around its not worth the drive headache or money to attend id rather drive somewhere else,0
the employees at this store have a negative attitude a few weeks ago i bought two pairs of nike shoes but back then they used to help customers put on their shoes now all they do is take them out of the box and hand them over no one seems happy to work there i also asked for shoelaces for my nike hyperdunks and they sold me two pairs that were too short they told me those were the longest ones they had but when i got home i realized they were a foot too short i went back to get the right size but the attitude was still there it seems they only carry foot locker laces and wont make any attempts to order from nike they play gangster rap music which is not pleasant to listen to they couldnt even tell me where nike is located and told me to go there for laces i wont be buying shoes from this store again,0
this airport may be busy but it provides an enjoyable experience with numerous food choices and relaxing spots to wait for flights the presence of white rocking chairs adds a charming touch,1

i was surprised when i first got to the airport because i had to go down the stairs of the plane and outside before i could get to my gate but other than that i had a good time at the airport however i noticed that all the airport workers and people who lived near the airport were very rude which made me wonder because they live in a nice town this behavior bothered me a lot and made me not like being there i cant understand how people can be unhappy when they live in such a nice place,1
the employees at this store exhibit a negative demeanor a few weeks ago i purchased two pairs of nike shoes but previously they used to assist customers in putting on their shoes now all they do is remove the shoes from the box and hand them over no one appears to be happy working there i also requested shoelaces for my nike hyperdunks and was sold two pairs that were too short they informed me those were the longest ones they had but upon returning home i realized they were a foot too short i returned to acquire the correct size but the attitude remained it seems they only carry foot locker laces and refuse to make efforts to order from nike they play gangster rap music which is not enjoyable to listen to they were unable to inform me of nikes location and told me to go there for laces i will not be purchasing shoes from this store again,0
dont judge this restaurant by its exterior the inside is beautifully decorated with a rich authentic feel the staff is very friendly and the food is divine especially the shrimp chili mint noodles and pad thai,4

shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think it is always busy here and the most popular airline is us airways so i am not sure how i feel about that the aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane the cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel nnwhen i landed here initially i got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that i had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate definitely a first other than that i enjoyed my time at the aiport nnthe one thing that i did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely rude i am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town but every person i had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone really irriated me and i hated being there i am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town blew my mind away but than again i will never get  people i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here,1
bestbuy and i go way back way back when i used to also be on friendly terms with circuit city before cc up and did a corporate houdini disappearing and not reappearing trick on me  but enough about my past failed relationships it is 2014 but not for much longer lets talk about what is in the now and the futurennthe best buy brand is still struggling just like in the tough years that lead to ccs eventual brick and mortar stores being liquidated in 2009 since the economy is still soft the online and very real competitive threats still remained and growing bigger and bolder  but i am glad there is still a bb to go to when i am aimlessly shopping for electronics or accessories that i may or may not know i need or want  seriously there is nothing that can beat holding something tangible in your hand when shopping for a new piece of equipment or experiencing the visual and audio components of your new udtv or 3d audio equipment for your home theater upgrade 1 for sure on that alonennblack fridays is an annual festival of barely contained consumerism in a time when many are still questioning the pace of economic recovery  long lines earlier store opening time and diverse selections of seemingly crazy markdowns on items from all product categories  last year i scored 20 game of thrones season 1 and 2 on bluray even after arriving to the party late  i had to look really hard for them but it was still in stock  this year no sale on got but i still ended up spending more than i should on more bluray movies  season sets plus a laptop so cheap it can practically be considered disposablennon typical weekdays and weekends bb still have some decent sales promotions  but you really have to look hard for the best in class deals  doctor who season 5 and 6 on bluray for also 20 apiece  sweet these were like 30 on the big a dot com plus shipping at the time i scored that deal alas i never saw such great deals on doctor who season sets ever again  insert sad facennbesides the good deals and sometimes really good deals the reason i continue to shop here and the other best buy stores is their customer service  bb associates typically will ask if they can help you with what you are looking for except on black friday weekends which is cool if you need help but they are okay if you just want to be left alone to wander the aisles of merchandise aimlessly for an hour or more  looking to buy electronics that does not appeared to be stocked asking any associates that is not currently assisting another customer is the way to go  most of them are good at their job and some of them i have discovered are really persistent like when they look for something that is supposedly in stock but is not located where it is supposed to be  i considered that great customer service and is the one thing you typically cant get shopping onlinennso speedy checkout good customer service not too much upselling decent pricing and the ability to tangibly see the items you are shopping for equals 35 stars in my book  since it is the long thanksgiving weekend i will round it up to 4  happy thanksgivingblack friday and cyber monday everyone,3
