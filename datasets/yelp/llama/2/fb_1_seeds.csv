0,i typically visit las vegas for business purposes 34 times a month but this particular trip has been the worst experience of my life i decided to book a reservation at this hotel due to its prime location and affordable rates but 195 per night is still a bit steep the lobby and casino looked nice but the elevators were in disrepair the room was filthy and smelled like an ashtray and urine and the carpet was incredibly dirty when i requested an early checkout the staff was rude so i contacted total rewards and they were able to transfer us to the paris hotel for an additional 80 per night which was a completely different and better experience sorry quad but i wont be returning,i usually go to vegas  3 or 4 days once a month for business but this is so far the worst experience of my life i decide to make my reservation in this hotel  because i was taking a few days off work and this place was perfect because of the location and the affordable rates but still 195 per night is not cheap the lobby and casino looks very nice the  big surprise is  when you get to your room the elevators are falling apart the room is filthy smells like an ashtray and pee  the carpet is sooo dirty  when i call for an  early check out the staff was so rude  i call the total rewards and they were able to move us to paris hotel for 80 more of what we paid before paris was a total different experience  sorry the quad but never again

1,one reviewer aptly described their experience at this store as akin to black friday every day despite the chaotic atmosphere i felt it was still worth visiting and exploring the abundance of designer items at discounted prices while the shoes and purses were in disarray the dresses and tops offered a diverse selection making it a great place to find unique pieces i tried on several items but only left with a casual dress and tank top planning to return another day for more shopping,one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another
1,a reviewer once compared shopping at this store to a black friday experience and i can attest to the accuracy of that statement the store was in disarray during my visit but the variety of designer items at affordable prices made it a worthwhile trip although the shoes and purses were in poor condition the dresses and tops offered an extensive selection making it an ideal location for finding stylish pieces i tried on multiple items but ultimately left with only a casual dress and tank top looking forward to returning another day to continue shopping,one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another

1,my friend and i visited a popular fast food chain for the second time and i opted for a chocolate shake unfortunately i found it to be excessively sweet and could only manage a few bites before feeling discomfort in my stomach my friend had a similar experience with a peanut butter shake despite the fact that the taste was enjoyable at first its almost as if were both allergic to sugar or something despite this the restaurants quick service and friendly staff make me want to give it another try perhaps ill ask for a smaller portion next time,me and my bff went again this time i got the shake i think they are called glaciers regular custard with cookies and caramel after about 4 bites i couldnt eat anymore its just to sweet my bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar i just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience we just must be sugar intolerantnni want to love this place so much they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good maybe ill see if they make an extra small
1,my friend and i have visited a certain fast food establishment twice now and both times weve had the same disappointing experience i ordered a chocolate shake which initially tasted great but quickly became overwhelmingly sweet i could only manage a few bites before my stomach started to hurt my friend had a similar reaction to their peanut butter shake despite enjoying the taste its almost as if were both sensitive to sugar or something despite this the restaurants staff is always friendly and efficient which makes me want to give it another chance maybe ill ask for a smaller size next,me and my bff went again this time i got the shake i think they are called glaciers regular custard with cookies and caramel after about 4 bites i couldnt eat anymore its just to sweet my bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar i just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience we just must be sugar intolerantnni want to love this place so much they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good maybe ill see if they make an extra small
1,i fondly recall the rios heyday in the late 1990s when it was the goto destination for a lively hotel casino experience unfortunately the years have not been kind to the property and it now shows signs of neglect and disrepair the rooms are spacious but outdated lacking modern amenities like flatscreen tvs and the carpet drapes and bathrooms are in dire need of a refresh its clear that harrahs acquired the property at a high cost and is now trying to maximize their returns but its a shame to see such a oncegrand establishment in such a state i only stayed here on new years eve because i waited too long to book a room at my usual haunts like aria and the wynn the restaurants were mediocre back in the day and still havent improved although the burger i had at american grill was quite tasty the crowd here isnt exactly stylish and the karaoke performances by bikiniclad women on top of the slot machines have definitely upped the cheese factor i wont be returning to the rio anytime soon,i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotel casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90s  its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorlynnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens  carpet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor  harrahs bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it  its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too long to book at the places i normally stay at like aria and the wynn  restaurants werent great back in the 90s and still arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was really tasty  no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machinesnndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here

1,this establishment is subpar not only is it pricey but the food quality is also poor we tried the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and each dish was disappointing in its own way the chicken curry was a mistake on my part as it was dry and lacked flavor the pork rice was also underwhelming with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was mediocre with stucktogether noodles and defrosted meatballs the only redeeming quality was the flavorful broth,this place is awful not only is it expensive the food quality was poor we ordered the meatball pho the chicken curry and the pork ricennfirst up for review the chicken curry it was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant the chicken was dry and the curry itself was blandnnthe pork rice wasnt any better  the rice was hard and the pork had no flavornnthe best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasnt good  the noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer  the only thing that was decent was their broth  it was flavorful but that was it

1,over the past year and a half baci has seen a decline in business due to the arrival of new competitors in the area when they were the only game in town they could charge high prices and provide subpar service but now they need to reassess their customer service and product offerings to stay competitive,over the year and half baci has gone down hill when he was the only business in the area he could command the price and act the way they do but since other businesses moved into the area and have a  much better product and pricing baci need to rethink customer service and their product

2,im somewhat conflicted about this establishment i believe it warrants a second visit to give it a fair assessment but ill share my initial impressions here the staff was friendly and welcoming which made for a positive start i opted for the lunch 2meat combo selecting ribs and brisket based on positive reviews the ribs were st louisstyle spare ribs which were tender and flavorful but a bit fatty the brisket was tasty but a tad dry so i added some of their bbq sauce the sauce complemented the ribs well but im not sure id order either dish again id like to return and try other menu items such as pulled pork and chicken for now ill give it three stars but ill update my review after my next visit,im kind of torn about this place  i think it deserves a second trip to really be fair  but ill document my first impressions herennfirst off the staff was nice and friendly  so it started off on a good note  i went for the lunch 2meat combo ribs and brisket since i read they were good in other reviews for 1299  the ribs were the st louis style spareribs not the baby back ribs i have grown to love  they were fatty but nice and tender  the brisket was flavorful but kind of dry so i elected to use some of their bbq sauce on the side  ultimately i think the sauce went better with the ribs  i probably wont order either again but id like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu  in particular the pulled pork and pulled chickennnill give it three stars for now but ill update on my next visit

2,during my initial visit to las vegas i stayed at the paris hotel but it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults so i switched to the sahara where i spent most of my vacation playing blackjack at the 2 nobust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and chatty but the food at pacos bar and grill was a disappointment and i suffered a bout of food poisoning from eating mexican cuisine at a desertthemed lowbudget casino despite this i still enjoy returning to the sahara for blackjack whenever im in vegas as it offers a unique nascar experience that i cant find elsewhere,the first time i came to vegas we were staying at the paris which apparently is just too full of functional nongambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls so we headed for the sahara and its 2 no bust blackjack tables  we basically spent our entire vacation at those tables  the dealers were fun and friendly even the pit bosses chatted with us  okay granted we were there for like three staff changes no sleep is necessary in vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor but they really were coolnnminus two stars for pacos bar and grill  a steady 13 hour diet of bud light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating mexican food at a desertthemed lowbudget casino would be a good idea  well bud light was wrong and i scored some impressive fbi food borne illness but danged if i didnt lose 5lbs on that tripnni still love the sahara though and i continue to return for blackjack every time im in vegas  come on it has its own nascar experience in it  i dont know what that is but im pretty sure its bud light and crappy mexican food which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the paris any day

2,while en route to a 1920sthemed event with some friends we arrived early and decided to explore a nearby store the sign on the door indicated that minors could enter with a parent and the store offered a variety of items including dvds for 499 or more halloween costumes at a 40 discount and a selection of plastic wear including items resembling lady gagas style additionally there were vhs tapes for sale and while the store was clean it had an older feel to it we found the name toy box to be slightly misleading as we expected more toys and fewer clothes nonetheless it seemed like a wellstocked store that might be popular among strippers although we couldnt confirm this assumption the adventure with my friends was an unexpected and enjoyable experience,was with some friends headed to a roaring 20s event and we were way early and one of my friends said hey lets check out this store so we did and the sign on the door says if you are under 18 you can get in with your parentnnwell cupids toy box offers dvds 499 or higher like my tip says and the store is clean but feels old if that makes any sense  you can find halloween costumes 40 off  and all the fun plastic wear you have ever thought of wearing you know dress up like lady gaga for a daynnoh and for you old schoolers on the discount table were vhs tapes for sale nnthey did have some toys and lets be honest with the name toy box i expected more toys and less clothes lol but thats just me  nnover all its a clean older shop that i am sure is frequented by stripers though i dont know any stripers personally so i cant back that statement up but this store seemed stocked with outfits and such for them  nnsometimes is an adventure when going out with my friends never know where we might end up at
