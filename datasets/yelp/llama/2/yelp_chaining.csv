if you delight in the rich flavors of tomato mozzarella and basil then youll surely enjoy,4
one reviewer aptly described this store as a constant state of bedlam but despite the disarray its still worth visiting for the chance to score some great deals on designer items the shoe and purse selection was a bit rough around the edges with noticeable wear and tear but the dresses and tops were plentiful and diverse i tried on a bunch of different items but ultimately left with a casual dress and tank top if youre looking to score some stylish finds without breaking the bank this store is worth checking out in small doses focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,1
if youre looking for a place to grab a bite to eat while youre out on the town this dennys is a great choice its got a great location and its open all day and night so its perfect for those latenight cravings but lets be real i wouldnt be caught dead eating here when im sober haha,3
when youre drunk as hell and trying to maintain your budget nothing beats this particular dennysnnseriously its at a really prime location on the strip and its open 24 hours a day what else can you ask fornnhowever i dont think i would eat here if i were sober haha,3
the flavors of the pupusas exploded in every bite leaving a delightful taste in my mouth,3
i was thoroughly impressed by the delectable nature of the pupusas they were truly a culinary delight,3
i have been a customer of bryant pest control for several years they have been wonderful to work with and the technicians have always been professional i live in seville in gilbert and being out here can be challenging with bugs scorpions etc they are thorough and personable they do not require a contract and are family owned,3
one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another,1
the first time i came to vegas we were staying at the paris which apparently is just too full of functional nongambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls so we headed for the sahara and its 2 no bust blackjack tables  we basically spent our entire vacation at those tables  the dealers were fun and friendly even the pit bosses chatted with us  okay granted we were there for like three staff changes no sleep is necessary in vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor but they really were coolnnminus two stars for pacos bar and grill  a steady 13 hour diet of bud light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating mexican food at a desertthemed lowbudget casino would be a good idea  well bud light was wrong and i scored some impressive fbi food borne illness but danged if i didnt lose 5lbs on that tripnni still love the sahara though and i continue to return for blackjack every time im in vegas  come on it has its own nascar experience in it  i dont know what that is but im pretty sure its bud light and crappy mexican food which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the paris any day,2
i have nothing good to say about the mac store at this location the makeup artist who helped me for my prom was unprofessional and did a horrible job she applied way too much foundation and the eyeshadow was a disaster i was devastated and had to redo my makeup as soon as i got home i would never recommend this place to anyone and instead suggest going to nordstrom or neiman marcus for a better makeup experience,0
this place is awful not only is it expensive the food quality was poor we ordered the meatball pho the chicken curry and the pork ricennfirst up for review the chicken curry it was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant the chicken was dry and the curry itself was blandnnthe pork rice wasnt any better  the rice was hard and the pork had no flavornnthe best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasnt good  the noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer  the only thing that was decent was their broth  it was flavorful but that was it,1
im thoroughly impressed with the freshness and greenness of this establishment i thoroughly enjoyed my chicken wrap and would readily choose it over other options like jimmy johns or subway the fact that its close to my workplace is a bonus but even if it werent id still prefer it i had heard about this place from an old classmate who used to work here and was kind enough to invite me to try it out the prices are reasonable and the flavors in my wrap were rich and satisfying im definitely looking forward to coming back,4

i gave this mac store a 1star rating because of the poor quality of service i received specifically the makeup artist who worked on my face for my high school prom did a terrible job using a foundation that was much darker than my skin tone and applying eyeshadow in a messy way i was left in tears and had to redo my makeup when i got home i would advise others to avoid getting their makeup done at this mac store and instead go to nordstrom or neiman marcus for a better experience,0

during my initial visit to las vegas i stayed at the paris hotel but it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults so i switched to the sahara where i spent the rest of my vacation playing blackjack at their 2 no bust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and engaging but i have to deduct two stars for the mediocre mexican food at pacos bar and grill which led to a 13hour bout of food poisoning despite that i still enjoy returning to the sahara for blackjack whenever im in vegas,2

this establishment is subpar not only is it pricey but the food quality is also poor we tried the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and none of them impressed us the chicken curry was a mistake on my part as it was dry and lacked flavor the pork rice was also disappointing with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was not great with stucktogether noodles and mediocre meatballs that tasted like they had just been thawed the only redeeming quality was the flavorful broth,1

my wife and i were on vacation when she had a seizure in the airport and ems took us to st lukes because it is so close im guessing if we had just been in the er i would give this place a five star the er staff were all so friendly and courteous to my wife and myself we have been in several hospitals before and no place has ever been so kind and caring especially for myself who waits by the bedside the whole time rebecca colleen and lee asked me several times if the patient needed anything made sure she had blankets to stay warm and made sure she had pain medicine for the after care from the seizure and fall they even brought me water and made sure i ate a meal even after i refused so i could stay in the room the er definitely went out of their way to make us feel like we were being taken care ofnnunfortunately as soon as my wife was admitted and taken upstairs to be further evaluated overnight the care totally flipped and turned for the worse the nurses were not friendly very short with us and showed no kindness we had to ask several times what was even going on and why she wasnt getting medication when the neurologist came in he never mentioned anything about taking my wife off pain medicine or anything and that is when things got even worse he prescribed her with a new seizure medication that turns out the hospital doesnt even carry so my wife went the whole night without seizure medication the doctors said they just wanted to release her because of the lack of medicine she ended up having one more seizure the nurses told us the heart monitor and video surveillance they use to monitor seizure patients would tell them she was having a seizure but i was the one who had to run out and tell them more than halfway through the seizure i stayed by her side thinking they would be alerted and come in they came in to the room only to leave right after i noticed the heart monitor cables had come off during the seizure so i let one of the nurses know and they said they would come back in over 30 minutes passed and during that time i had to find someone in the hallways to find me a puke bucket and help get her situated again in bed thank you male nurse not assigned to my wifes room it wasnt until i hung up with patient relationspr that a cna came in to help put the heart monitor back in place and working properly and that vital signs were taken the pr came up and thats when the day doctor finally came in to see the patient she let us know that she is following the neuros notes and that my wife wasnt even prescribed meds for seizures she proceeded to pull me out of the room to tell me the nephrologist believes my wife is either attention seeking or wanting drugs and the seizures are fake you can imagined frustration and outrage of this comment and what any person would do for their loved one hurting for the next two hours i argued and fought for patient rights and even asked for a new doctor it was then the doctor came back and admitted she read the patients chart wrong and that the neuro prescribed seizure meds and what she said was wrong this means the doctor lied and never even had a conversation with the neurologist even after we asked for a new doctor the hospital never gave us a new one and i even told them that if they werent going to given wife proper care to just give us the same medication she was previously on so we could get home they refused still the nurse finally came in and took the ivs out but then walked out without a word we were left  in there for ten minutes before we decided that we couldnt take any more and since she had all tubes out we should just leave mind you the hospital did not leave us with any prescriptions or anything even after three seizures in 24 hours never ever ever ever go to this hospital whether you live here or are going on vacation they do not respect the patients or give them any rights they have no bedside manor no empathy these people should not be in the health care field nor do they care about the people it is all about money to these heartless greedy people,0

im a huge sushi enthusiast and luckily sushi three is within walking distance from my home the temptation of their delicious sushi is always on my mind but the prices do help to keep my cravings in check for a couple of months at a time when i do visit i thoroughly enjoy every bite and sometimes ill even order takeout since they offer reasonable lunch deals i prefer to dine in though as the restaurant is quite peaceful allowing me to relax and enjoy my food in silence sushi three is definitely my goto spot for sushi as the other places ive tried in pittsburgh are loud and lacking in options,4
this casino offers a fantastic experience with a lively atmosphere excellent dining options and a spotless movie theater its even better that its located off the strip making it a more localfriendly destination,3
i have a strong affinity for sushi and sushi three is my top choice for satisfying my cravings its proximity to my home makes it an easy choice and while the prices may be a bit steep they help to regulate my sushi consumption when i do indulge i always enjoy the experience and occasionally ill order takeout since their lunch specials are quite reasonable the restaurant itself is very serene providing the perfect atmosphere to savor my food without distractions sushi three,4

i am a huge fan of sushi three they live within walking distance of my home so its no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind admittedly the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time but when i do come here i enjoy every bite occasionally i also order takeout since they have very reasonable lunch deals but really i prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itselfnnspeaking of the place itself is very quiet which i actually like i can just sit talk with a friend or read a book and then what a radical concept enjoy my food in peace this is a big deal for me because the other places i know of where i can get sushi are loud busy and quite frankly a little limiting optionswise compared to sushi threes menu if i want sushi i either come here or i get a small pack at giant eagle thats how much i hate the other sushi places ive visited in pittsburgh if im going to pay as much as i do for my fish i want to be in a place i can sit and actually enjoy my foodnnby the way sushi three does serve things other than sushi so people looking for some japanese food that isnt rice and fish are definitely going to find something theres some really delicious beef chicken and pork dishes but of course a place with the word sushi in its name is going to specialize in sushi and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here the orders come in various styles and sizes as well so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves the combos all come with soup and salad which are also very yummynni at this point have developed a routine order a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all i need here sure ill occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me but the truth is that sushi three makes such enormous orders that i cant eat more than that without feeling a bit sick nnbut hey at least you get your moneys worth i say definitely give this place a shot if youre a sushi fan,4

on our latest outing my best friend and i tried the ice cream shops signature glacier shake which was essentially a rich creamy custard with cookies and caramel however we both found it too sweet and could only manage a few bites before feeling uncomfortable in our stomachs despite our initial excitement we have come to realize that we might be sugar intolerant which is a disappointment since we appreciate the restaurants promptness and welcoming atmosphere,1
pupusas oh how they tantalized my taste buds with their savory goodness,3
i have a deep appreciation for this restaurant the ambiance is warm and inviting and the cuisine is exceptional,4
me and my bff went again this time i got the shake i think they are called glaciers regular custard with cookies and caramel after about 4 bites i couldnt eat anymore its just to sweet my bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar i just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience we just must be sugar intolerantnni want to love this place so much they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good maybe ill see if they make an extra small,1
upon returning to the ice cream parlor with my friend we were eager to try their famous glacier shakes however we were caught off guard by the intense sweetness and could only manage a few bites before feeling queasy,1
