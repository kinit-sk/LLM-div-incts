i was not initially planning to try asian cuisine but since my choice was based on this address httpwwwqypefrplace8103kommoedchenkarlsruhe i ended up at a restaurant that served a variety of asian dishes despite being in a different neighborhood i stumbled upon a place that served delicious food especially their buffet wok which offered 20 different specialties for a reasonable price the restaurant had a cozy atmosphere and the staff was friendly making it a great value for the price,3
ive had the misfortune of dealing with dr kile a vet who doesnt possess the necessary people skills and some of his staff members are equally unfriendly i took two of my dogs and a couple of puppies to his clinic but he incorrectly diagnosed one of them and i ended up paying a hefty sum for medication and treatment that didnt work when i asked about treating another dog dr kile became argumentative and wouldnt listen to my concerns to top it all off he insulted me leaving a sour taste in my mouth i wont be taking any,0
on our latest outing my best friend and i tried the ice cream shops signature glacier shake which was essentially a rich creamy custard with cookies and caramel unfortunately we both found it too sweet and could only manage a few bites before feeling discomfort in our stomachs despite our initial enthusiasm weve come to realize that we might be sugar intolerant which is a disappointment since we appreciate the restaurants promptness and welcoming atmosphere,1

one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another,1

me and my bff went again this time i got the shake i think they are called glaciers regular custard with cookies and caramel after about 4 bites i couldnt eat anymore its just to sweet my bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar i just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience we just must be sugar intolerantnni want to love this place so much they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good maybe ill see if they make an extra small,1
if youre looking for a reliable place to get your makeup done i would steer clear of this particular macys store i had a horrible encounter with the makeup artist who worked there who applied far too much foundation that was much darker than my skin tone and made a mess of my eyeshadow i was devastated and had to remove it all when i got home then redo my makeup myself instead try going to nordstrom or neiman marcus for a more positive experience with mac makeup artists,0

one reviewer aptly described this store as a constant state of bedlam but despite the disarray its still worth visiting for the chance to score some great deals on designer items the shoe and purse selection was a bit rough around the edges with noticeable wear and tear but the dresses and tops were plentiful and diverse i tried on a bunch of different items but ultimately left with a casual dress and tank top if youre looking to score some stylish finds without breaking the bank this store is worth checking out in small doses focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,1
ive been to vegas a few times and the first time i visited i stayed at the paris hotel however i quickly realized that it wasnt the best fit for me and my friends as it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults we decided to head over to the sahara hotel instead where we spent the rest of our vacation playing blackjack at the 2 no bust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and chatty and we had a great time minus a couple of stars for the mediocre food at pacos bar and grill despite my questionable judgment after consuming too much bud light i still enjoyed my time at the sahara and continue to return for blackjack whenever im in vegas,2

according to one reviewer this store is like black friday every day  a chaotic mess but with the potential for great deals while the shoes and purses were in disrepair the dresses and tops offered a wealth of options despite trying on many items i only walked away with a casual dress and tank top if youre willing to sift through the chaos you might find some great designer pieces at affordable prices its a good idea to tackle this store in small sections focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,1
meh ive experienced better exactly what i was thinkingnnafter all the hype ive heard about the famous pinks hot dogs in la i seriously thought i would have been blown away by the experience maybe its because of the hype that shot my expectations through the roof but wouldnt you think with all the hype it should at least make me want to come back for more nnbut im the kind of girl that always gives a place the benefit of the doubt perhaps i ordered something notsoamazing on the menu  the pastrami reuben dog i honestly thought this was a pretty good choice equipped with hot dog pastrami mustard swiss cheese  sauerkraut i mean its not the fattiest of the bunch but lets be honest the scorching hot weather was taking a negative toll on my appetite regardless of my choice i had the chance to have a bite of a few others  the planet hollywood the vegas strip dog chili cheese fries nothing really sang to me ya know in other words i was hoping for more something more memorable and amazing rather than just a meal to fill me up i think ill give the la pinks a chance but if that doesnt change my mind who knows what will,1

the first time i came to vegas we were staying at the paris which apparently is just too full of functional nongambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls so we headed for the sahara and its 2 no bust blackjack tables  we basically spent our entire vacation at those tables  the dealers were fun and friendly even the pit bosses chatted with us  okay granted we were there for like three staff changes no sleep is necessary in vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor but they really were coolnnminus two stars for pacos bar and grill  a steady 13 hour diet of bud light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating mexican food at a desertthemed lowbudget casino would be a good idea  well bud light was wrong and i scored some impressive fbi food borne illness but danged if i didnt lose 5lbs on that tripnni still love the sahara though and i continue to return for blackjack every time im in vegas  come on it has its own nascar experience in it  i dont know what that is but im pretty sure its bud light and crappy mexican food which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the paris any day,2

i usually go to vegas  3 or 4 days once a month for business but this is so far the worst experience of my life i decide to make my reservation in this hotel  because i was taking a few days off work and this place was perfect because of the location and the affordable rates but still 195 per night is not cheap the lobby and casino looks very nice the  big surprise is  when you get to your room the elevators are falling apart the room is filthy smells like an ashtray and pee  the carpet is sooo dirty  when i call for an  early check out the staff was so rude  i call the total rewards and they were able to move us to paris hotel for 80 more of what we paid before paris was a total different experience  sorry the quad but never again,0

i am a huge fan of sushi three they live within walking distance of my home so its no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind admittedly the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time but when i do come here i enjoy every bite occasionally i also order takeout since they have very reasonable lunch deals but really i prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itselfnnspeaking of the place itself is very quiet which i actually like i can just sit talk with a friend or read a book and then what a radical concept enjoy my food in peace this is a big deal for me because the other places i know of where i can get sushi are loud busy and quite frankly a little limiting optionswise compared to sushi threes menu if i want sushi i either come here or i get a small pack at giant eagle thats how much i hate the other sushi places ive visited in pittsburgh if im going to pay as much as i do for my fish i want to be in a place i can sit and actually enjoy my foodnnby the way sushi three does serve things other than sushi so people looking for some japanese food that isnt rice and fish are definitely going to find something theres some really delicious beef chicken and pork dishes but of course a place with the word sushi in its name is going to specialize in sushi and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here the orders come in various styles and sizes as well so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves the combos all come with soup and salad which are also very yummynni at this point have developed a routine order a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all i need here sure ill occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me but the truth is that sushi three makes such enormous orders that i cant eat more than that without feeling a bit sick nnbut hey at least you get your moneys worth i say definitely give this place a shot if youre a sushi fan,4
this place is a letdown both in terms of cost and food quality we ordered the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice but unfortunately they didnt meet our expectations the chicken curry was a mistake as it was dry and had little flavor the pork rice was also a disappointment with hard rice and unseasoned pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was not impressive with noodles that were all stuck together and meatballs that tasted like they had just,1

a reviewer once said that shopping at this store was like experiencing black friday daily when i went the store was indeed a mess but i have a feeling thats the standard despite the mayhem its worth the visit for the potential to find excellent deals on quality merchandise the shoes and purses were in poor condition with visible flaws like holes and pen marks but the dresses and tops were abundant and included many highend choices i tried on a lot of items but only purchased a casual dress and tank top if you want to visit this store,1
if youre in the vicinity of pb you should definitely stop by for a bite to eat the menu may not be extensive but the quality of the food makes up for it the market fresh sandwich of the day is always a great choice and the outdoor seating area is a nice bonus you wont find anything quite like this place in phoenix or maybe even beyond,4
i typically visit las vegas for business purposes 34 days a month but this particular trip has been the worst experience of my life i chose to stay at this hotel because of its location and affordable rates but 195 per night is still expensive the lobby and casino looked nice but the elevators were in disrepair the room was dirty and smelled like an ashtray and urine and the carpet was filthy when i requested an early checkout the staff was rude but i was able to switch to the paris hotel for an additional 80 per night through the total rewards program needless to say ill never stay at the quad again,0
this eatery exceeded my expectations with its inviting ambiance and delectable cuisine the chicken wrap i had the pleasure of enjoying was packed with flavor and left me feeling fulfilled while its close proximity to my workplace may pose a threat to my productivity i am grateful for the opportunity to indulge in such culinary delights the prices are fair and the menu offers a diverse selection making it an excellent choice for a quick satisfying meal i am excited to return and explore more of their offerings,4
im on the fence about this place the staff was friendly but the food was a mixed bag i went for the lunch special which included ribs and brisket but the ribs were not what i was expecting they were st louisstyle spareribs which were fatty and tender but not my cup of tea the brisket was flavorful but a bit dry so i added some bbq sauce to give it a boost im,2
this place is awful not only is it expensive the food quality was poor we ordered the meatball pho the chicken curry and the pork ricennfirst up for review the chicken curry it was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant the chicken was dry and the curry itself was blandnnthe pork rice wasnt any better  the rice was hard and the pork had no flavornnthe best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasnt good  the noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer  the only thing that was decent was their broth  it was flavorful but that was it,1
i recently visited this medical center with a throat infection and i was pleased with the efficient care i received the staff were quick to attend to me and the lady at the front desk was very pleasant and accommodating the doctor was also very helpful in offering me a range of medication and treatment options,4
tomato mozzarella basil sandwiches  crack sandwiches  i work near pb and go often  if you are looking for a huge menu with a large seating area dont be surprised to find a few items and the market fresh sandwich of the day on the menu and outdoor seating  thats what makes this place so great the food is fab and theres nothing else like this place in phoenixor perhaps the whole world,4
i received a prompt online order but the honey chicken had a sweeter taste than expected and the lettuce wraps didnt come with the usual meat filling maybe dining in would be a better experience if i want to try autumn courts fare in the future,2
chicken bread and canes sauce make for a tasty trio and the service is always on point even in the drivethru,4
this casino has a great atmosphere amazing places to eat and a very clean movie theater it doesnt get much better than that i think that its great that its off of the strip and that its more a place for locals than tourists,3
truthfully i dont understand what the whole hubbub is about this place its yummy for suresome of the better eggs benedict and coffee ive had around these parts but an hour wait really i went to delucas a few times truthfully out of the urgings of a nytimes article and was pretty disappointed each visit its just ok food ok atmosphere and bad service nncome to jersey ill show you a good breakfast,2
this 1 star rating is only for the mac part of this macysnmac  macysnif you have somewhere special to go to and you want your makeup done please please do not get your makeup done here at least not with the kind of big makeup artist whos kind of bubbly that works herenni had a really bad experience here when i got my makeup done for highschool promwhiiile backk but she did my makeup and told me it was a surprise until the end i chose my eyeshadow but when i saw my face it was filled with foundation that was wayy darker than my skin tone and my eyeshadow was kind of a mess this put me to tears considering that i was going to take pics 2 hours from that time i completely took it off when i got home and redid my make upnnso pleaseeee if you want to experience having your make up done by mac makeup artists please do me a favor and go to nordstroms or neiman marcus going to macys for mac was a nightmare,0
i was not familiar with the area so i chose a restaurant based on its online presence it turned out to be a great decision as the restaurant offered a diverse selection of asian dishes including a buffet wok with 20 different options the food was fresh and flavorful and the staff was attentive and friendly overall it was a great dining experience at a reasonable price,3
my experience at this mac store was a complete disaster the makeup artist who did my makeup for prom was not only unfriendly but she also did a terrible job my foundation was way too dark and my eyeshadow was a mess i was left,0
im searching for a stylish british pub in the downtown area with a friendly team behind the bar reasonable rates and a laidback ambiance while id love to give it a perfect score the constant football matches playing on the tvs detract from my enjoyment still its a solid 4 stars from me,3
i had a room reserved through travelocity but they cancelled it without consulting me citing construction as the reason when i called the hotel to inquire they told me they had no available rooms it appears that travelocity customers are being pushed aside in favor of other reservations,0
im feeling ambivalent about this place i think its worthy of a second visit to give it a fair evaluation but for now ill share my first impressions the staff was warm and inviting which set the tone for a positive experience i went for the lunch 2meat combo choosing the spare ribs and brisket as they came highly recommended while the ribs were tender and flavorful the brisket was,2
after reading about this eatery on a popular food board we decided to give it a go we tried three different tacos and a pollo dish and despite the smaller tortillas they were bursting with deliciousness,2

this casino is a true gem boasting a fantastic atmosphere topnotch dining and a stateoftheart movie theater and the best part its tucked away from the tourist crowds making it a perfect spot for locals to enjoy,3
i recall the rios heyday in the late 1990s when it was the goto destination for a lively hotel casino experience unfortunately the property has not aged well with outdated rooms tired carpets and drapes and bathrooms in need of a refresh its clear that harrahs acquired the property and is trying to maximize profits but its a shame to see such a oncegrand establishment in decline i only stayed here on new years eve because i waited too long to book my usual spots at aria or the wynn the restaurants were never great and while the burger at american grill was tasty the overall dining experience was nothing special the atmosphere has become quite cheesy with bikiniclad singers performing karaoke on top of slot machines i wouldnt be returning to the rio,1
im not sure why everyones so obsessed with this place sure the eggs benedict and coffee are good but is it really worth waiting in line for an hour ive been to delucas a few times and while its not terrible its not exactly the best either if youre looking for a great breakfast spot you might want to check out some other,2
my partner and i went out for an early dinner and were inspired by reviews we had read when we arrived we were seated at a table for two and given menus by the host however the waiter who took our drink orders was unfriendly and seemed impatient the only kind server we encountered was the girl who brought us our drinks and chips with salsa unfortunately the atmosphere was ruined by a screeching child and the chips and salsa were underwhelming we didnt even get the chance to review the food as the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and leave no one seemed to care that we were unhappy with our experience,0
we had read about this restaurant on the chowhound board and decided to give it a try  we ordered 3 pastors and 1 pollo  though the tortillas are on the small size they are delicious and filled to overflowing,2
over the past year and a half baci has seen a decline in business due to the arrival of new competitors in the area when they were the only game in town they could charge higher prices and maintain a certain level of service quality however with the entry of new businesses offering better products and more competitive pricing baci needs to reassess their customer service and product offerings to stay competitive,1
as a sushi enthusiast ive found a gem of a restaurant thats conveniently located near my home the prices may be a tad steep but the quality of the food makes it worth the splurge the atmosphere is peaceful and serene allowing me to savor every bite without feeling rushed plus the menu offers a variety of options beyond sushi including delectable beef pork and chicken dishes,4
the rio was once the place to be for a night of excitement and entertainment but those days are long gone the rooms may be spacious but theyre sorely,1
this place is a letdown and not just because of the high prices the food quality is questionable and we were left underwhelmed by our meals we ordered the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice but each dish failed to impress the chicken curry was a mistake as it was bland and the chicken was overcooked the pork rice was similarly disappointing with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was subpar with clum,1
this establishment is subpar not only is it pricey but the food quality is also disappointing we tried the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and each dish fell short of our expectations the chicken curry was a mistake on my part as it lacked flavor and the chicken was overcooked the pork rice was equally unimpressive with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was mediocre with clumpy noodles and defrosted meatballs the only redeeming quality was the flavorful broth,1
to be honest im not sure what all the fuss is about when it comes to this place sure the eggs benedict and coffee are pretty good but an hour wait ive been to delucas a few times and was underwhelmed each visit the food is just okay the atmosphere is nothing special and the service is subpar if you want a really good breakfast come to jersey and ill show you the way,2
if youre looking for a great place to spend an evening this venue has it all from fine dining to a topnotch movie theater its the perfect destination for a night out and the best part its located just off the strip so you can avoid the tourist traps and enjoy a more local experience,3
my partner and i went for an early dinner  we were inspired by reviews on yelp and echo magazine  when we entered we got escorted by the host to a table for two and supplied with menus  he was not welcoming or talkative just doing his job  shortly after came the waiter who was hostile and obnoxious  to take our drink orders  he made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done  the girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit  there was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable the chips and salsa were underwhelming and my sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water  i would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go  no one stopped us to ask why  they just didnt care  i dont know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome  it was one of the worst experiences weve had in phoenixmanuel p,0

im a huge sushi enthusiast and luckily sushi three is within walking distance from my home the temptation of their delicious sushi is always on my mind but the prices do help to keep my cravings in check for a couple of months at a time when i do visit i thoroughly enjoy every bite and sometimes ill even order takeout since they offer reasonable lunch deals i prefer to dine in though as the restaurant is quite peaceful allowing me to relax and enjoy my food in silence sushi three is definitely my goto spot for sushi as the other places ive tried in pittsburgh are loud and lacking in options,4
was with some friends headed to a roaring 20s event and we were way early and one of my friends said hey lets check out this store so we did and the sign on the door says if you are under 18 you can get in with your parentnnwell cupids toy box offers dvds 499 or higher like my tip says and the store is clean but feels old if that makes any sense  you can find halloween costumes 40 off  and all the fun plastic wear you have ever thought of wearing you know dress up like lady gaga for a daynnoh and for you old schoolers on the discount table were vhs tapes for sale nnthey did have some toys and lets be honest with the name toy box i expected more toys and less clothes lol but thats just me  nnover all its a clean older shop that i am sure is frequented by stripers though i dont know any stripers personally so i cant back that statement up but this store seemed stocked with outfits and such for them  nnsometimes is an adventure when going out with my friends never know where we might end up at,2

if anyone knows of a stylish british pub in the heart of the city with a warm and welcoming staff reasonable prices and a laidback ambiance id be eternally grateful just fyi im not a fan of soccer so if its always playing on the tvs its a bit of a dealbreaker for me,3
i wasnt originally planning to try asian cuisine but since my choice was between that and a restaurant that i had never heard of i decided to give it a try as it turned out i made a mistake with the address and ended up at a different restaurant but i was still able to enjoy a variety of dishes including sushi grilled meats and a buffet with 150 specialties from chinese thai vietnamese and japanese cuisine the restaurant had a cozy atmosphere with a sympathetic terrace and a wellmaintained interior the menu offered a range of options including a buffet with 20 different dishes for a fixed price of 690 euros and the quality and freshness of the food were evident the only downside was the unfriendly service but overall i would still recommend this restaurant,3
i was out with some friends and we were heading to a roaring 20s event we arrived early and one of my friends suggested we check out a nearby store the sign on the door said that minors could enter with a parent or guardian and the store had a variety of items including dvds for 499 or higher and a selection of halloween costumes and novelty plastic wear it also had a discount table with vhs tapes for sale,2
im upset because i had a confirmed reservation through travelocity but they cancelled it due to construction and now the hotel is claiming they dont have any available rooms it seems like travelocity customers are being treated unfairly and not being given the same priority as other guests,0
i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotel casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90s  its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorlynnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens  carpet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor  harrahs bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it  its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too long to book at the places i normally stay at like aria and the wynn  restaurants werent great back in the 90s and still arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was really tasty  no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machinesnndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here,1

the past year and a half has seen a significant decrease in bacis market share as new competitors have entered the area and offered better products and prices to adapt to this changed market landscape baci needs to rethink their approach to customer service and product quality,1
i typically spend a few days in las vegas once a month for work but this particular trip has been the worst experience of my life i chose to stay at this hotel because of its convenient location and affordable rates but 195 per night is still a bit steep the lobby and casino looked nice but the elevators were in disrepair the room was filthy and smelled like an ashtray and urine and the carpet was incredibly dirty when i requested an early checkout the staff was rude so i contacted total rewards and they were able to move us to the paris hotel for an additional 80 per night the paris hotel was a completely different experience and ill never stay at the quad again,0
while en route to a 1920sthemed event with some friends we arrived early and decided to explore a nearby store the sign on the door indicated that minors could enter with a parent or guardian and the store offered an assortment of dvds for 499 or more as well as a variety of halloween costumes at a 40 discount the store had a vintage feel to it and in addition to clothing they also sold vhs tapes and some toys despite the name toy box i was surprised to find fewer toys and more clothing options overall it seemed like a clean and wellstocked store that might be popular among strippers although i couldnt confirm this assumption,2
my wife and i were on vacation when she had a seizure in the airport and ems took us to st lukes because it is so close im guessing if we had just been in the er i would give this place a five star the er staff were all so friendly and courteous to my wife and myself we have been in several hospitals before and no place has ever been so kind and caring especially for myself who waits by the bedside the whole time rebecca colleen and lee asked me several times if the patient needed anything made sure she had blankets to stay warm and made sure she had pain medicine for the after care from the seizure and fall they even brought me water and made sure i ate a meal even after i refused so i could stay in the room the er definitely went out of their way to make us feel like we were being taken care ofnnunfortunately as soon as my wife was admitted and taken upstairs to be further evaluated overnight the care totally flipped and turned for the worse the nurses were not friendly very short with us and showed no kindness we had to ask several times what was even going on and why she wasnt getting medication when the neurologist came in he never mentioned anything about taking my wife off pain medicine or anything and that is when things got even worse he prescribed her with a new seizure medication that turns out the hospital doesnt even carry so my wife went the whole night without seizure medication the doctors said they just wanted to release her because of the lack of medicine she ended up having one more seizure the nurses told us the heart monitor and video surveillance they use to monitor seizure patients would tell them she was having a seizure but i was the one who had to run out and tell them more than halfway through the seizure i stayed by her side thinking they would be alerted and come in they came in to the room only to leave right after i noticed the heart monitor cables had come off during the seizure so i let one of the nurses know and they said they would come back in over 30 minutes passed and during that time i had to find someone in the hallways to find me a puke bucket and help get her situated again in bed thank you male nurse not assigned to my wifes room it wasnt until i hung up with patient relationspr that a cna came in to help put the heart monitor back in place and working properly and that vital signs were taken the pr came up and thats when the day doctor finally came in to see the patient she let us know that she is following the neuros notes and that my wife wasnt even prescribed meds for seizures she proceeded to pull me out of the room to tell me the nephrologist believes my wife is either attention seeking or wanting drugs and the seizures are fake you can imagined frustration and outrage of this comment and what any person would do for their loved one hurting for the next two hours i argued and fought for patient rights and even asked for a new doctor it was then the doctor came back and admitted she read the patients chart wrong and that the neuro prescribed seizure meds and what she said was wrong this means the doctor lied and never even had a conversation with the neurologist even after we asked for a new doctor the hospital never gave us a new one and i even told them that if they werent going to given wife proper care to just give us the same medication she was previously on so we could get home they refused still the nurse finally came in and took the ivs out but then walked out without a word we were left  in there for ten minutes before we decided that we couldnt take any more and since she had all tubes out we should just leave mind you the hospital did not leave us with any prescriptions or anything even after three seizures in 24 hours never ever ever ever go to this hospital whether you live here or are going on vacation they do not respect the patients or give them any rights they have no bedside manor no empathy these people should not be in the health care field nor do they care about the people it is all about money to these heartless greedy people,0

stopped by here with some strep throat they were very quick and the lady up front was very nice and accommodating the doctor was very helpful and he offered me many different options for medicines and treatments ive also had other family members come to this location and they all enjoyed their experience,4
im not sure what all the hype is about when it comes to this restaurant sure they have some decent breakfast options but the wait time is ridiculous ive tried delucas a few times and was disappointed each visit the food is mediocre at best the atmosphere is nothing special and the service is lacking if youre looking for a truly great breakfast come to jersey and ill show you where to go,2

during my initial visit to las vegas i stayed at the paris hotel but it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults so i switched to the sahara where i spent the rest of my vacation playing blackjack at their 2 no bust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and engaging but i have to deduct two stars for the mediocre mexican food at pacos bar and grill which led to a 13hour bout of food poisoning despite that i still enjoy returning to the sahara for blackjack whenever im in vegas,2
im somewhat conflicted about this establishment while the staff was friendly and welcoming i feel that a second visit is necessary to give a fair assessment my first impressions were positive but i have some reservations i ordered the lunch 2meat combo which included ribs and brisket but i was disappointed that the ribs were not the baby back ribs i had expected they were tender but quite fatty the brisket was flavorful but a bit dry so i added some of their bbq sauce to enhance the taste overall i give it three stars for now but im open to revisiting and trying other menu items such as pulled pork and chicken,2
i was looking for a new dining experience and i found it at a restaurant that served a variety of asian cuisine the buffet wok was particularly impressive with 20 different specialties to choose from the food was delicious and the staff was wel,3

one reviewer aptly described their experience at this store as akin to black friday every day the place was a disorganized mess when i visited but i suspect thats the norm despite the chaos its worth checking out for the possibility of finding great deals on quality items the shoe and purse selection was lacking with visible damage like holes and tears but the dress and top options were plentiful and included many designer choices i tried on numerous items but only left with a casual dress and tank top this store would be a good place to visit in small increments focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,1
i recently visited pinks hot dogs in la and unfortunately my experience didnt live up to the hype despite the high expectations i didnt find the food particularly impressive i ordered the pastrami reuben dog which seemed like a good choice but it didnt blow me away the scorching hot weather might have affected my appetite but i still expected more from my meal i had the chance to try a few other dishes like the planet hollywood and the vegas strip dog but they didnt impress me either overall i was hoping for a more memorable experience but it didnt quite meet my expectations,1
this place is so fresh and so green green  n  i loved my chicken wrap to bad their so close to my official work place or else i would eat this over jimmy johns and subway any day this time i was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy n how lucky was i i had heard of this place from an old classmate from tempe he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections ni truly loved the flavors in my wrap so full and bold i was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end nway to go zk bistro you rock  i look forward to coming here more often,4
ive had a lessthanideal experience with dr kile and his team despite the clinics close location ive encountered issues with the doctors people skills as well as those of some of his staff one of my dogs was incorrectly diagnosed resulting in costly and ineffective treatment when i inquired about treating another dog dr kile was uncooperative and unprofessional i wont be taking any of my dogs back to this clinic which is a shame considering its convenient location,0
im kind of torn about this place  i think it deserves a second trip to really be fair  but ill document my first impressions herennfirst off the staff was nice and friendly  so it started off on a good note  i went for the lunch 2meat combo ribs and brisket since i read they were good in other reviews for 1299  the ribs were the st louis style spareribs not the baby back ribs i have grown to love  they were fatty but nice and tender  the brisket was flavorful but kind of dry so i elected to use some of their bbq sauce on the side  ultimately i think the sauce went better with the ribs  i probably wont order either again but id like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu  in particular the pulled pork and pulled chickennnill give it three stars for now but ill update on my next visit,2
if youre looking for a place to eat after a night out on the town this dennys is a great option its located in a prime spot and is open all day every day its got everything you need but im not sure id want to eat here if i were sober maybe its just the drink talking but its definitely worth a visit,3

on my first trip to vegas i stayed at the paris but it was packed with kids and adults who didnt seem to be there to gamble or drink so i headed to the sahara where i found some great blackjack tables the dealers and pit bosses were really friendly and we had a blast chatting with them however i have to say that the mexican food at pacos bar and grill was a letdown and i ended up getting pretty sick from it despite that i still love the sahara and always come back for the blackjack when im in town,2

im a big fan of sushi and im lucky to have a fantastic sushi restaurant just a short walk from my house while the prices may be a bit high the taste and quality of the food make it well worth the investment the restaurant itself is quite tranquil providing the perfect setting to enjoy a meal with a friend or simply indulge in some solo dining and with a diverse menu that includes sushi beef pork and chicken options theres something for everyone,4
i have a strong affinity for sushi and sushi three is my top choice for satisfying my cravings its proximity to my home makes it an easy choice and while the prices may be a bit steep they help to regulate my sushi consumption when i do indulge i always enjoy the experience and occasionally ill order takeout since their lunch specials are quite reasonable the restaurant itself is very serene providing the perfect atmosphere to savor my food without distractions sushi three,4
i would advise against getting your makeup done at this particular macys location especially if you have a special event or occasion to attend i had a terrible experience with the makeup artist there who applied way too much foundation that didnt match my skin tone and botched my eyeshadow i ended up in tears and had to redo my makeup at home instead i would recommend going to nordstrom or neiman marcus for a better experience with mac makeup artists,0
i was thoroughly impressed by the delectable nature of the pupusas they were truly a culinary delight,3
im somewhat conflicted about this establishment while i think it has potential i feel that a second visit is necessary to give it a fair assessment however i will share my initial impressions the staff was friendly and welcoming which was a great start i opted for the lunch 2meat combo selecting the st louisstyle spare ribs and brisket as i had read positive reviews about them the ribs were tender and flavorful but the brisket was a bit dry so i added some of their bbq sauce to enhance the flavor overall id give the meal three stars for now but im eager to return and try more items on the menu such as the pulled pork and chicken,2

when youre feeling the effects of a night out and trying to stay within your means this dennys is the way to go its situated in a prime spot on the strip and its always open so you can satisfy your cravings at any time but lets be real i wouldnt want to eat here unless i was feeling the effects of a good time haha,3
i had high hopes for sharing my experience at this establishment but unfortunately we never got the chance to stay there i made a reservation through a thirdparty website and received a confirmation number but a week later i received an email informing me that there would be construction taking place during our visit i was advised to call a certain number if i had any questions which i did but i was told that my reservation had been cancelled due to the establishment being closed i decided to call the establishment directly and i was told that they were not closed but there were no rooms available it seems that my reservation was cancelled without my consent and now im being told that theyre fully booked its quite frustrating to say the least,0
my partner and i went out for an early dinner and were influenced by reviews we had read on yelp and echo magazine when we arrived we were seated at a table for two and given menus by the host the waiter took our drink orders without much enthusiasm and seemed eager to finish our order quickly the only friendly service we received was from the server who brought us our drinks and chips with salsa unfortunately the atmosphere was spoiled by a screaming child and the chips and salsa were disappointing my sprite even tasted like it had been dunked in toilet water since the waiter never returned to take our food order we decided to pay for our drinks and leave no one seemed to care that we were unhappy with our experience,0
i was out with some friends who were heading to a 1920sthemed event and we arrived early one of my friends suggested we check out a nearby store and the sign on the door said that minors could enter with a parent or guardian the store had a variety of items including dvds for 499 or higher and a selection of halloween costumes and novelty plastic wear it also had a discount table with vhs tapes for sale while i expected more toys and less clothing from a store called toy box it was still a fun and unique place to explore overall it seemed like a clean and wellstocked shop that might be popular with strippers although i dont know any personally,2
i recall the rios heyday when it was the goto destination for a lively casino experience but alas those glory days are long behind it now the rooms are generous in size but the outdated decor and lack of modern amenities like flatscreen tvs and updated bathrooms make for a lessthandesirable stay its clear that harrahs acquired this property and is trying to maximize their profits but its a shame to see such a oncegrand establishment fall into disrepair i only chose to stay here on new years eve because i procrastinated when it came to booking my usual haunts like aria and the wynn the dining options were never great and while the burger at american grill was tasty the overall quality of the food remains subpar the atmosphere has also become rather cheesy with bikiniclad women singing karaoke on top of slot machines needless to say i wont be returning to the rio,1
this establishment is subpar not only is it pricey but the food quality is also poor we tried the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and none of them impressed us the chicken curry was a mistake on my part as it was dry and lacked flavor the pork rice was also disappointing with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was not great with stucktogether noodles and mediocre meatballs that tasted like they had just been thawed the only redeeming quality was the flavorful broth,1
i was suffering from strep throat and decided to visit this medical clinic the staff were very efficient and the lady at the front desk was very pleasant the doctor was very knowledgeable and offered me a range of medication and treatment options i would definitely recommend this clinic to my family and friends,4
