0,my spouse and i were on vacation when she had a seizure at the airport and ems took us to st lukes hospital the er staff were very friendly and courteous and we were impressed with the level of care they provided unfortunately the care took a turn for the worse once my wife was admitted to the hospital the nurses were unfriendly and showed no empathy and we had to ask multiple times for updates on her condition the neurologist prescribed a new seizure medication that the hospital didnt carry and my wife went without medication for an entire night she ended up having another seizure and the nurses were slow to respond the hospitals patient relations department was unhelpful and we were left feeling frustrated and angry,my wife and i were on vacation when she had a seizure in the airport and ems took us to st lukes because it is so close im guessing if we had just been in the er i would give this place a five star the er staff were all so friendly and courteous to my wife and myself we have been in several hospitals before and no place has ever been so kind and caring especially for myself who waits by the bedside the whole time rebecca colleen and lee asked me several times if the patient needed anything made sure she had blankets to stay warm and made sure she had pain medicine for the after care from the seizure and fall they even brought me water and made sure i ate a meal even after i refused so i could stay in the room the er definitely went out of their way to make us feel like we were being taken care ofnnunfortunately as soon as my wife was admitted and taken upstairs to be further evaluated overnight the care totally flipped and turned for the worse the nurses were not friendly very short with us and showed no kindness we had to ask several times what was even going on and why she wasnt getting medication when the neurologist came in he never mentioned anything about taking my wife off pain medicine or anything and that is when things got even worse he prescribed her with a new seizure medication that turns out the hospital doesnt even carry so my wife went the whole night without seizure medication the doctors said they just wanted to release her because of the lack of medicine she ended up having one more seizure the nurses told us the heart monitor and video surveillance they use to monitor seizure patients would tell them she was having a seizure but i was the one who had to run out and tell them more than halfway through the seizure i stayed by her side thinking they would be alerted and come in they came in to the room only to leave right after i noticed the heart monitor cables had come off during the seizure so i let one of the nurses know and they said they would come back in over 30 minutes passed and during that time i had to find someone in the hallways to find me a puke bucket and help get her situated again in bed thank you male nurse not assigned to my wifes room it wasnt until i hung up with patient relationspr that a cna came in to help put the heart monitor back in place and working properly and that vital signs were taken the pr came up and thats when the day doctor finally came in to see the patient she let us know that she is following the neuros notes and that my wife wasnt even prescribed meds for seizures she proceeded to pull me out of the room to tell me the nephrologist believes my wife is either attention seeking or wanting drugs and the seizures are fake you can imagined frustration and outrage of this comment and what any person would do for their loved one hurting for the next two hours i argued and fought for patient rights and even asked for a new doctor it was then the doctor came back and admitted she read the patients chart wrong and that the neuro prescribed seizure meds and what she said was wrong this means the doctor lied and never even had a conversation with the neurologist even after we asked for a new doctor the hospital never gave us a new one and i even told them that if they werent going to given wife proper care to just give us the same medication she was previously on so we could get home they refused still the nurse finally came in and took the ivs out but then walked out without a word we were left  in there for ten minutes before we decided that we couldnt take any more and since she had all tubes out we should just leave mind you the hospital did not leave us with any prescriptions or anything even after three seizures in 24 hours never ever ever ever go to this hospital whether you live here or are going on vacation they do not respect the patients or give them any rights they have no bedside manor no empathy these people should not be in the health care field nor do they care about the people it is all about money to these heartless greedy people

0,i typically spend a few days in las vegas once a month for work but this particular trip has been the worst experience of my life i chose to stay at this hotel because of its convenient location and affordable rates but 195 per night is still a bit steep the lobby and casino looked nice but the elevators were in disrepair the room was filthy and smelled like an ashtray and urine and the carpet was incredibly dirty when i requested an early checkout the staff was rude so i contacted total rewards and they were able to move us to the paris hotel for an additional 80 per night the paris hotel was a completely different experience and ill never stay at the quad again,i usually go to vegas  3 or 4 days once a month for business but this is so far the worst experience of my life i decide to make my reservation in this hotel  because i was taking a few days off work and this place was perfect because of the location and the affordable rates but still 195 per night is not cheap the lobby and casino looks very nice the  big surprise is  when you get to your room the elevators are falling apart the room is filthy smells like an ashtray and pee  the carpet is sooo dirty  when i call for an  early check out the staff was so rude  i call the total rewards and they were able to move us to paris hotel for 80 more of what we paid before paris was a total different experience  sorry the quad but never again

0,my partner and i went out for an early dinner and were inspired by reviews we had read when we arrived we were seated at a table for two and given menus by the host however the waiter who took our drink orders was unfriendly and seemed impatient the only kind server we encountered was the girl who brought us our drinks and chips with salsa unfortunately the atmosphere was ruined by a screeching child and the chips and salsa were underwhelming we didnt even get the chance to review the food as the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and leave no one seemed to care that we were unhappy with our experience,my partner and i went for an early dinner  we were inspired by reviews on yelp and echo magazine  when we entered we got escorted by the host to a table for two and supplied with menus  he was not welcoming or talkative just doing his job  shortly after came the waiter who was hostile and obnoxious  to take our drink orders  he made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done  the girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit  there was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable the chips and salsa were underwhelming and my sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water  i would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go  no one stopped us to ask why  they just didnt care  i dont know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome  it was one of the worst experiences weve had in phoenixmanuel p

0,ive taken two of my dogs to dr kiles clinic and while the location is convenient the service has been disappointing the doctor and some of his staff lack interpersonal skills which has led to misunderstandings and miscommunications one of my dogs was misdiagnosed and i paid a significant amount for unnecessary treatment and medication when i asked about treating another dog dr kile was dismissive and argumentative i wont be returning to this clinic with any of my dogs which is unfortunate given its proximity to my home,ive taken 2 of my dogs to dr kile and a couple puppies  he has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals  he misdiagnosed one of my dogs and i paid a ton for his services and medication for a treatment that did nothing  at one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what i had to say  when asking about a treatment for another of my dogs i was insulted by dr kile  i will never bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home
0,ive had a lessthanideal experience with dr kile and his team despite the clinics close location ive encountered issues with the doctors people skills as well as those of some of his staff one of my dogs was incorrectly diagnosed resulting in costly and ineffective treatment when i inquired about treating another dog dr kile was uncooperative and unprofessional i wont be taking any of my dogs back to this clinic which is a shame considering its convenient location,ive taken 2 of my dogs to dr kile and a couple puppies  he has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals  he misdiagnosed one of my dogs and i paid a ton for his services and medication for a treatment that did nothing  at one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what i had to say  when asking about a treatment for another of my dogs i was insulted by dr kile  i will never bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home

1,i recall the rios heyday when it was the goto destination for a lively casino experience but alas those glory days are long behind it now the rooms are generous in size but the outdated decor and lack of modern amenities like flatscreen tvs and updated bathrooms make for a lessthandesirable stay its clear that harrahs acquired this property and is trying to maximize their profits but its a shame to see such a oncegrand establishment fall into disrepair i only chose to stay here on new years eve because i procrastinated when it came to booking my usual haunts like aria and the wynn the dining options were never great and while the burger at american grill was tasty the overall quality of the food remains subpar the atmosphere has also become rather cheesy with bikiniclad women singing karaoke on top of slot machines needless to say i wont be returning to the rio,i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotel casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90s  its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorlynnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens  carpet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor  harrahs bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it  its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too long to book at the places i normally stay at like aria and the wynn  restaurants werent great back in the 90s and still arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was really tasty  no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machinesnndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here

1,one reviewer aptly described their experience at this store as akin to black friday every day the place was a disorganized mess when i visited but i suspect thats the norm despite the chaos its worth checking out for the possibility of finding great deals on quality items the shoe and purse selection was lacking with visible damage like holes and tears but the dress and top options were plentiful and included many designer choices i tried on numerous items but only left with a casual dress and tank top this store would be a good place to visit in small increments focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another
1,a reviewer once said that shopping at this store was like experiencing black friday daily when i went the store was indeed a mess but i have a feeling thats the standard despite the mayhem its worth the visit for the potential to find excellent deals on quality merchandise the shoes and purses were in poor condition with visible flaws like holes and pen marks but the dresses and tops were abundant and included many highend choices i tried on a lot of items but only purchased a casual dress and tank top if you want to visit this store,one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another
1,this establishment is subpar not only is it pricey but the food quality is also disappointing we tried the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and each dish fell short of our expectations the chicken curry was a mistake on my part as it lacked flavor and the chicken was overcooked the pork rice was equally unimpressive with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was mediocre with clumpy noodles and defrosted meatballs the only redeeming quality was the flavorful broth,this place is awful not only is it expensive the food quality was poor we ordered the meatball pho the chicken curry and the pork ricennfirst up for review the chicken curry it was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant the chicken was dry and the curry itself was blandnnthe pork rice wasnt any better  the rice was hard and the pork had no flavornnthe best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasnt good  the noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer  the only thing that was decent was their broth  it was flavorful but that was it

2,while en route to a 1920sthemed event with some friends we arrived early and decided to explore a nearby store the sign on the door indicated that minors could enter with a parent or guardian and the store offered an assortment of dvds for 499 or more as well as a variety of halloween costumes at a 40 discount the store had a vintage feel to it and in addition to clothing they also sold vhs tapes and some toys despite the name toy box i was surprised to find fewer toys and more clothing options overall it seemed like a clean and wellstocked store that might be popular among strippers although i couldnt confirm this assumption,was with some friends headed to a roaring 20s event and we were way early and one of my friends said hey lets check out this store so we did and the sign on the door says if you are under 18 you can get in with your parentnnwell cupids toy box offers dvds 499 or higher like my tip says and the store is clean but feels old if that makes any sense  you can find halloween costumes 40 off  and all the fun plastic wear you have ever thought of wearing you know dress up like lady gaga for a daynnoh and for you old schoolers on the discount table were vhs tapes for sale nnthey did have some toys and lets be honest with the name toy box i expected more toys and less clothes lol but thats just me  nnover all its a clean older shop that i am sure is frequented by stripers though i dont know any stripers personally so i cant back that statement up but this store seemed stocked with outfits and such for them  nnsometimes is an adventure when going out with my friends never know where we might end up at
2,as my friends and i were heading to a roaring twenties event we found ourselves arriving early and decided to kill some time by checking out a nearby store the sign on the door mentioned that minors could enter with a parent or guardian and the store offered a range of dvds for 499 or higher as well as a selection of halloween costumes at a 40 discount the store had a somewhat oldfashioned feel to it and in addition to,was with some friends headed to a roaring 20s event and we were way early and one of my friends said hey lets check out this store so we did and the sign on the door says if you are under 18 you can get in with your parentnnwell cupids toy box offers dvds 499 or higher like my tip says and the store is clean but feels old if that makes any sense  you can find halloween costumes 40 off  and all the fun plastic wear you have ever thought of wearing you know dress up like lady gaga for a daynnoh and for you old schoolers on the discount table were vhs tapes for sale nnthey did have some toys and lets be honest with the name toy box i expected more toys and less clothes lol but thats just me  nnover all its a clean older shop that i am sure is frequented by stripers though i dont know any stripers personally so i cant back that statement up but this store seemed stocked with outfits and such for them  nnsometimes is an adventure when going out with my friends never know where we might end up at
2,im somewhat conflicted about this establishment while i think it has potential i feel that a second visit is necessary to give it a fair assessment however i will share my initial impressions the staff was friendly and welcoming which was a great start i opted for the lunch 2meat combo selecting the st louisstyle spare ribs and brisket as i had read positive reviews about them the ribs were tender and flavorful but the brisket was a bit dry so i added some of their bbq sauce to enhance the flavor overall id give the meal three stars for now but im eager to return and try more items on the menu such as the pulled pork and chicken,im kind of torn about this place  i think it deserves a second trip to really be fair  but ill document my first impressions herennfirst off the staff was nice and friendly  so it started off on a good note  i went for the lunch 2meat combo ribs and brisket since i read they were good in other reviews for 1299  the ribs were the st louis style spareribs not the baby back ribs i have grown to love  they were fatty but nice and tender  the brisket was flavorful but kind of dry so i elected to use some of their bbq sauce on the side  ultimately i think the sauce went better with the ribs  i probably wont order either again but id like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu  in particular the pulled pork and pulled chickennnill give it three stars for now but ill update on my next visit
2,im feeling ambivalent about this place i think its worthy of a second visit to give it a fair evaluation but for now ill share my first impressions the staff was warm and inviting which set the tone for a positive experience i went for the lunch 2meat combo choosing the spare ribs and brisket as they came highly recommended while the ribs were tender and flavorful the brisket was,im kind of torn about this place  i think it deserves a second trip to really be fair  but ill document my first impressions herennfirst off the staff was nice and friendly  so it started off on a good note  i went for the lunch 2meat combo ribs and brisket since i read they were good in other reviews for 1299  the ribs were the st louis style spareribs not the baby back ribs i have grown to love  they were fatty but nice and tender  the brisket was flavorful but kind of dry so i elected to use some of their bbq sauce on the side  ultimately i think the sauce went better with the ribs  i probably wont order either again but id like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu  in particular the pulled pork and pulled chickennnill give it three stars for now but ill update on my next visit

2,ive been to vegas a few times and the first time i visited i stayed at the paris hotel however i quickly realized that it wasnt the best fit for me and my friends as it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults we decided to head over to the sahara hotel instead where we spent the rest of our vacation playing blackjack at the 2 no bust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and chatty and we had a great time minus a couple of stars for the mediocre food at pacos bar and grill despite my questionable judgment after consuming too much bud light i still enjoyed my time at the sahara and continue to return for blackjack whenever im in vegas,the first time i came to vegas we were staying at the paris which apparently is just too full of functional nongambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls so we headed for the sahara and its 2 no bust blackjack tables  we basically spent our entire vacation at those tables  the dealers were fun and friendly even the pit bosses chatted with us  okay granted we were there for like three staff changes no sleep is necessary in vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor but they really were coolnnminus two stars for pacos bar and grill  a steady 13 hour diet of bud light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating mexican food at a desertthemed lowbudget casino would be a good idea  well bud light was wrong and i scored some impressive fbi food borne illness but danged if i didnt lose 5lbs on that tripnni still love the sahara though and i continue to return for blackjack every time im in vegas  come on it has its own nascar experience in it  i dont know what that is but im pretty sure its bud light and crappy mexican food which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the paris any day
