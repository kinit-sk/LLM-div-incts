im frustrated because i had a confirmed reservation through travelocity but they cancelled it due to construction at the hotel when i called the hotel they said they were sold out and couldnt accommodate me it seems unfair that they would cancel my reservation without offering an alternative solution,4
i gave this macys store a 1star rating specifically for the mac part of the store if youre looking to get your makeup done for a special occasion i would not recommend getting it done here i had a terrible experience with one of the makeup artists who worked here and it left me in tears instead i would suggest going to nordstrom or neiman marcus for your makeup needs,4
during my initial visit to las vegas i stayed at the paris hotel but it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults so i switched to the sahara where i spent most of my vacation playing blackjack at the 2 nobust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and chatty but the food at pacos bar and grill was a disappointment and i suffered a bout of food poisoning from eating mexican cuisine at a desertthemed lowbudget casino despite this i still enjoy returning to the sahara for blackjack whenever im in vegas as it offers a unique nascar experience that i cant find elsewhere,2

im a huge sushi enthusiast and luckily sushi three is within walking distance from my home the temptation of their delicious sushi is always on my mind but the prices do help to keep my cravings in check for a couple of months at a time when i do visit i thoroughly enjoy every bite and sometimes ill even order takeout since they offer reasonable lunch deals i prefer to dine in though as the restaurant is quite peaceful allowing me to relax and enjoy my food in silence sushi three is definitely my goto spot for sushi as the other places ive tried in pittsburgh are loud and lacking in options,0
me and my bff went again this time i got the shake i think they are called glaciers regular custard with cookies and caramel after about 4 bites i couldnt eat anymore its just to sweet my bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar i just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience we just must be sugar intolerantnni want to love this place so much they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good maybe ill see if they make an extra small,3
the past year and a half has seen a significant decrease in bacis market share as new competitors have entered the area and offered better products and prices to adapt to this changed market landscape baci needs to rethink their approach to customer service and product quality,3
this casino offers a fantastic experience with a lively atmosphere excellent dining options and a spotless movie theater its even better that its located off the strip making it a more localfriendly destination,1
if youre looking for a great time this casino has it all  a vibrant atmosphere delicious food and a pristine movie theater plus its offstrip location makes it a hidden gem for locals,1
this establishment is subpar not only is it pricey but the food quality is also poor we tried the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and each dish was disappointing in its own way the chicken curry was a mistake on my part as it was dry and lacked flavor the pork rice was also underwhelming with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was mediocre with stucktogether noodles and defrosted meatballs the only redeeming quality was the flavorful broth,3
im not sure i understand why this place is so popular sure the eggs benedict and coffee are good but is it worth an hour wait ive been to delucas a few times and while its not bad its not great either the food is just okay and the atmosphere and service are nothing special i think people are overhyping it a bit,2

i was not impressed with this restaurant its expensive and the food quality is poor we ordered the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice and none of them lived up to my expectations the chicken curry was a mistake as it was dry and had no flavor the pork rice was also a letdown with hard rice and flavorless pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was subpar with stucktogether noodles and defrosted meatballs the only positive aspect was the,3
ive had a disappointing experience with dr kile who lacked adequate communication skills and incorrectly diagnosed one of my dogs despite paying a significant amount for his services and medication the treatment was ineffective when i inquired about treating another dog dr kile was dismissive and rude i wont be returning to his office which is unfortunate given its proximity to my home,4
my partner and i went for an early dinner  we were inspired by reviews on yelp and echo magazine  when we entered we got escorted by the host to a table for two and supplied with menus  he was not welcoming or talkative just doing his job  shortly after came the waiter who was hostile and obnoxious  to take our drink orders  he made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done  the girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit  there was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable the chips and salsa were underwhelming and my sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water  i would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go  no one stopped us to ask why  they just didnt care  i dont know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome  it was one of the worst experiences weve had in phoenixmanuel p,4

jerry the proprietor is a talented artisan who creates tattoos not for financial gain but for the passion he has for the craft despite his skill his prices are surprisingly affordable making his shop my goto destination for highquality tattoos,0
i have a strong affinity for sushi and sushi three is my top choice for satisfying my cravings its proximity to my home makes it an easy choice and while the prices may be a bit steep they help to regulate my sushi consumption when i do indulge i always enjoy the experience and occasionally ill order takeout since their lunch specials are quite reasonable the restaurant itself is very serene providing the perfect atmosphere to savor my food without distractions sushi three,0
one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another,3
bacis struggles in the past year and a half can be attributed to the influx of new businesses in the area which have offered superior products and pricing to regain their footing baci needs to adapt their customer service and product offerings to meet the changing demands of the market,3
stopped by here with some strep throat they were very quick and the lady up front was very nice and accommodating the doctor was very helpful and he offered me many different options for medicines and treatments ive also had other family members come to this location and they all enjoyed their experience,0
ive had the pleasure of being a customer of bryant pest control for a number of years now and i must say theyve been an absolute delight to work with their technicians are always professional courteous and thorough in their work as a resident of seville in gilbert i can attest to the challenges that come with living in an area with a high bug and scorpion population however bryant pest control has always had my back providing me with topnotch service thats tailored to my specific needs the best part they dont require a contract and their familyowned business approach makes me feel like im in good hands,1
im looking for a trendy british pub in the city center with a welcoming staff reasonable prices and a chill vibe while id give it a 5star rating i have to deduct a point because they always show soccer here and im not a fan,1
this casino has a great atmosphere amazing places to eat and a very clean movie theater it doesnt get much better than that i think that its great that its off of the strip and that its more a place for locals than tourists,1
after researching this restaurant on a popular food board we decided to pay it a visit we tried three different tacos and a chicken entree and although the tortillas were on the smaller side they were filled to the brim with delicious ingredients,2
one reviewer aptly described this store as a constant state of bedlam but despite the disarray its still worth visiting for the chance to score some great deals on designer items the shoe and purse selection was a bit rough around the edges with noticeable wear and tear but the dresses and tops were plentiful and diverse i tried on a bunch of different items but ultimately left with a casual dress and tank top if youre looking to score some stylish finds without breaking the bank this store is worth checking out in small doses focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,3
over the year and half baci has gone down hill when he was the only business in the area he could command the price and act the way they do but since other businesses moved into the area and have a  much better product and pricing baci need to rethink customer service and their product,3
i have a strong affinity for sushi and fortunately sushi three is located close to my home making it easily accessible while the prices may be a tad steep they do serve as a deterrent to overindulgence however when i do visit i thoroughly enjoy every bite additionally they offer reasonable lunch deals for takeout but i prefer to dine inhouse as the atmosphere is tranquil allowing me to savor my food in peace the menu boasts an impressive variety of sushi options and i often order a large salad and softshell crab rolls the portions are generous and i usually cant finish more than that without feeling uncomfortably full nonetheless i highly recommend sushi three to sushi enthusiasts,0
i had a prompt delivery of my online order but the honey chicken didnt live up to its name tasting more like a sweet and sour dish the lettuce wraps were also underwhelming lacking the expected filling given the unimpressive experience im uncertain about trying autumn courts food again and i might opt for dining in instead,2
im not trying to be negative but i just dont get why everyone is so obsessed with this place sure its got some good breakfast options but the wait is ridiculous ive tried delucas a few times and its just not that great the food is average and the service is subpar i think people are making too big of a deal out of it,2
cant go wrong with the classics chicken bread and canes sauce and topnotch service to boot,0
ive had better experiences to be honest all the hype around pinks hot dogs in la led me to expect something truly exceptional but unfortunately it didnt quite live up to my expectations maybe it was the high expectations that led to my disappointment but i thought that with all the hype the experience should have been more memorable i gave the place the benefit of the doubt and ordered the pastrami reuben dog which seemed like a good choice but it wasnt exactly what i was hoping for the hot weather also affected my appetite so i didnt get to try much else from the menu im willing to give pinks another chance but im not sure if itll be enough to change my mind,3
i received my online order in a timely manner but unfortunately the honey chicken didnt quite live up to my expectations it had a stronger sweet and sour flavor than i had anticipated furthermore the lettuce wraps lacked the advertised toppings leaving me feeling disappointed if i decide to dine at autumn courts again ill make sure to eat in the restaurant instead of ordering online,2
love canes more like love everything their chicken bread and sauce are all topnotch and the service is always friendly and efficient whether youre dining in or grabbing a quick bite at the drivethru,0

my spouse and i were on vacation when she experienced a seizure at the airport and ems brought us to st lukes hospital the er staff were very friendly and courteous but the care took a turn for the worse once my wife was admitted to the hospital the nurses were unfriendly and we had to ask multiple times for updates on her condition the neurologist prescribed a new seizure medication but the hospital didnt carry it and my wife went without medication for the whole night she had another seizure and the nurses didnt respond promptly i had to find someone to help me get her settled again in bed and it wasnt until i spoke with patient relations that a cna came in to assist the patient relations representative told us that the doctor had read my wifes chart wrong and that the neurologist had prescribed seizure medication despite this the hospital didnt give us a new doctor and we were left with no choice but to leave,4

i had a room booked through travelocity but they suddenly cancelled it citing construction at the hotel when i contacted the hotel directly they claimed they were fully booked and couldnt help me its strange that travelocity would cancel my reservation without providing an alternative especially since the hotel seems to have availability,4

while on vacation my wife experienced a seizure in the airport and was taken to st lukes hospital by ems despite the initial kindness and care shown by the er staff the quality of care drastically declined once she was admitted to the hospital the nurses were unfriendly and we had to repeatedly ask for basic needs such as pain medicine and water the neurologist even accused my wife of faking her seizures to get drugs which was unacceptable we fought for proper care and eventually left the hospital without any prescriptions or assistance,4
a reviewer once compared shopping at this store to a black friday experience and i can attest to the accuracy of that statement the store was in disarray during my visit but the variety of designer items at affordable prices made it a worthwhile trip although the shoes and purses were in poor condition the dresses and tops offered an extensive selection making it an ideal location for finding stylish pieces i tried on multiple items but ultimately left with only a casual dress and tank top looking forward to returning another day to continue shopping,3

i usually spend a few days in las vegas each month for work but this trip has been a nightmare i chose this hotel because of its convenient location and reasonable rates but the room was a disappointment the elevators were broken the room was dirty and smelled like smoke and urine and the carpet was disgusting when i asked for an early checkout the staff was unhelpful so i contacted total rewards and,4
i received a promptly delivered online order  however the honey chicken tasted more like sweet and sour and i was sure the lettuce wraps would come with something more or other than ground up pan fried meat  perhaps the in restaurant experience would have been better  should i decide to dine on autumn courts fare in the future i will be sure to dine in only,2
to be honest im not sure what all the fuss is about when it comes to this place sure the eggs benedict and coffee are pretty good but is it worth waiting in line for an hour ive been to delucas a few times before and while the food and atmosphere are decent the service has been subpar if youre looking for a truly great breakfast you might want to consider somewhere else,2
i was thoroughly impressed by the delectable nature of the pupusas they were truly a culinary delight,1
according to one reviewer this store is like black friday every day  a chaotic mess but with the potential for great deals while the shoes and purses were in disrepair the dresses and tops offered a wealth of options despite trying on many items i only walked away with a casual dress and tank top if youre willing to sift through the chaos you might find some great designer pieces at affordable prices its a good idea to tackle this store in small sections focusing on dresses one day and shoes another,3
this 1 star rating is only for the mac part of this macysnmac  macysnif you have somewhere special to go to and you want your makeup done please please do not get your makeup done here at least not with the kind of big makeup artist whos kind of bubbly that works herenni had a really bad experience here when i got my makeup done for highschool promwhiiile backk but she did my makeup and told me it was a surprise until the end i chose my eyeshadow but when i saw my face it was filled with foundation that was wayy darker than my skin tone and my eyeshadow was kind of a mess this put me to tears considering that i was going to take pics 2 hours from that time i completely took it off when i got home and redid my make upnnso pleaseeee if you want to experience having your make up done by mac makeup artists please do me a favor and go to nordstroms or neiman marcus going to macys for mac was a nightmare,4
im kind of torn about this place  i think it deserves a second trip to really be fair  but ill document my first impressions herennfirst off the staff was nice and friendly  so it started off on a good note  i went for the lunch 2meat combo ribs and brisket since i read they were good in other reviews for 1299  the ribs were the st louis style spareribs not the baby back ribs i have grown to love  they were fatty but nice and tender  the brisket was flavorful but kind of dry so i elected to use some of their bbq sauce on the side  ultimately i think the sauce went better with the ribs  i probably wont order either again but id like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu  in particular the pulled pork and pulled chickennnill give it three stars for now but ill update on my next visit,2
the pupusas were a delight to taste their flavors bursting in every bite,1
i was out with some friends who were heading to a 1920sthemed event and we arrived early one of my friends suggested we check out a nearby store and the sign on the door said that minors could enter with a parent or guardian the store had a variety of items including dvds for 499 or higher and a selection of halloween costumes and novelty plastic wear it also had a discount table with vhs tapes for sale while i expected more toys and less clothing from a store called toy box it was still a fun and unique place to explore overall it seemed like a clean and wellstocked shop that might be popular with strippers although i dont know any personally,2
ive had the misfortune of dealing with dr kile a vet who doesnt possess the necessary people skills and some of his staff members are equally unfriendly i took two of my dogs and a couple of puppies to his clinic but he incorrectly diagnosed one of them and i ended up paying a hefty sum for medication and treatment that didnt work when i asked about treating another dog dr kile became argumentative and wouldnt listen to my concerns to top it all off he insulted me leaving a sour taste in my mouth i wont be taking any,4

i am a huge fan of sushi three they live within walking distance of my home so its no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind admittedly the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time but when i do come here i enjoy every bite occasionally i also order takeout since they have very reasonable lunch deals but really i prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itselfnnspeaking of the place itself is very quiet which i actually like i can just sit talk with a friend or read a book and then what a radical concept enjoy my food in peace this is a big deal for me because the other places i know of where i can get sushi are loud busy and quite frankly a little limiting optionswise compared to sushi threes menu if i want sushi i either come here or i get a small pack at giant eagle thats how much i hate the other sushi places ive visited in pittsburgh if im going to pay as much as i do for my fish i want to be in a place i can sit and actually enjoy my foodnnby the way sushi three does serve things other than sushi so people looking for some japanese food that isnt rice and fish are definitely going to find something theres some really delicious beef chicken and pork dishes but of course a place with the word sushi in its name is going to specialize in sushi and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here the orders come in various styles and sizes as well so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves the combos all come with soup and salad which are also very yummynni at this point have developed a routine order a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all i need here sure ill occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me but the truth is that sushi three makes such enormous orders that i cant eat more than that without feeling a bit sick nnbut hey at least you get your moneys worth i say definitely give this place a shot if youre a sushi fan,0

im on the fence about this place the staff was friendly but the food was a mixed bag i went for the lunch special which included ribs and brisket but the ribs were not what i was expecting they were st louisstyle spareribs which were fatty and tender but not my cup of tea the brisket was flavorful but a bit dry so i added some bbq sauce to give it a boost im,2
im a huge fan of this eatery the atmosphere is welcoming and the food is,0
the rio was once the place to be for a vibrant hotel casino experience but those days are long gone the rooms are now outdated and lack modern amenities like flatscreen tvs and the carpets and drapes are showing their age the bathrooms are in dire need of an update and it,3
we stumbled upon this restaurant on a food discussion board and decided to give it a shot we ordered three tacos and a chicken dish and although the tortillas were diminutive they were filled to the brim with mouthwatering ingredients,2
to be honest im not sure what all the fuss is about when it comes to this place sure the eggs benedict and coffee are decent but an hour wait ive been to delucas a few times and while the food is okay the atmosphere and service are nothing special i think people are making a bigger deal out of it than necessary,2
if youre in the vicinity of pb and have a hankering for a delicious tomato mozzarella basil sandwich youre in luck not only does this establishment offer a delectable variety of sandwiches but its outdoor seating area is also a great spot to enjoy your meal and dont be surprised if the menu changes daily as the market fresh sandwich of the day is always a welcome surprise this place truly stands out from the rest boasting a unique combination of great food and charming ambiance,0
the first time i came to vegas we were staying at the paris which apparently is just too full of functional nongambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls so we headed for the sahara and its 2 no bust blackjack tables  we basically spent our entire vacation at those tables  the dealers were fun and friendly even the pit bosses chatted with us  okay granted we were there for like three staff changes no sleep is necessary in vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor but they really were coolnnminus two stars for pacos bar and grill  a steady 13 hour diet of bud light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating mexican food at a desertthemed lowbudget casino would be a good idea  well bud light was wrong and i scored some impressive fbi food borne illness but danged if i didnt lose 5lbs on that tripnni still love the sahara though and i continue to return for blackjack every time im in vegas  come on it has its own nascar experience in it  i dont know what that is but im pretty sure its bud light and crappy mexican food which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the paris any day,2
cant get enough of love canes who can blame you their mouthwatering chicken fresh bread and signature sauce are a match made in heaven and lets not forget their excellent service which is always prompt and welcoming whether youre enjoying a meal in the restaurant or grabbing a quick takeout at the drivethru,0
i had a recent online ordering experience with autumn courts that left something to be desired the honey chicken dish had a sweeter and more sour taste than i had hoped for and the lettuce wraps were missing the additional ingredients i was expecting while the prompt delivery was appreciated the overall experience fell short if i choose to dine at autumn courts in the future ill,2
this place is a breath of fresh air both in terms of its ambiance and its culinary offerings i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to try it out and i was not disappointed the chicken wrap i had was packed with flavor and the prices were very reasonable ive heard great things about this place from a former classmate who used to work here and now i can see why its a great alternative to the usual fast food options and im excited to come back,0
i typically visit las vegas for business purposes 34 days a month but this particular trip has been the worst experience of my life i chose to stay at this hotel because of its location and affordable rates but 195 per night is still expensive the lobby and casino looked nice but the elevators were in disrepair the room was dirty and smelled like an ashtray and urine and the carpet was filthy when i requested an early checkout the staff was rude but i was able to switch to the paris hotel for an additional 80 per night through the total rewards program needless to say ill never stay at the quad again,4
this place is a letdown both in terms of cost and food quality we ordered the meatball pho chicken curry and pork rice but unfortunately they didnt meet our expectations the chicken curry was a mistake as it was dry and had little flavor the pork rice was also a disappointment with hard rice and unseasoned pork the meatball pho was the best of the three but even that was not impressive with noodles that were all stuck together and meatballs that tasted like they had just,3

if youre looking for a unique and enjoyable gaming experience this casino is the place to be with its inviting atmosphere topnotch dining and pristine movie theater its a true gem and the best part its located away from the bustling strip making it a locals secret hideaway,1
i was looking forward to staying at a hotel but my reservation was cancelled by travelocity due to construction when i tried to book a new room the hotel said they were sold out its confusing and frustrating that travelocity would cancel my reservation without offering a solution especially since the hotel seems to have availability,4
im hooked on this place the ambiance is refreshing and the food is incredibly tasty i recently had the pleasure of trying their chicken wrap and let me tell you it was love at first bite the prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are generous im so glad i stumbled upon this hidden gem and i cant wait to come back for more oh and did i mention that its conveniently located near my workplace its a winwin situation,0
when youre feeling quite intoxicated and trying to stay within your budget this particular dennys location is hard to beat its prime spot on the strip and 24hour availability make it a great option however im not sure id want to eat here if i were sober,1
my wife and i were on vacation when she had a seizure in the airport and ems took us to st lukes because it is so close im guessing if we had just been in the er i would give this place a five star the er staff were all so friendly and courteous to my wife and myself we have been in several hospitals before and no place has ever been so kind and caring especially for myself who waits by the bedside the whole time rebecca colleen and lee asked me several times if the patient needed anything made sure she had blankets to stay warm and made sure she had pain medicine for the after care from the seizure and fall they even brought me water and made sure i ate a meal even after i refused so i could stay in the room the er definitely went out of their way to make us feel like we were being taken care ofnnunfortunately as soon as my wife was admitted and taken upstairs to be further evaluated overnight the care totally flipped and turned for the worse the nurses were not friendly very short with us and showed no kindness we had to ask several times what was even going on and why she wasnt getting medication when the neurologist came in he never mentioned anything about taking my wife off pain medicine or anything and that is when things got even worse he prescribed her with a new seizure medication that turns out the hospital doesnt even carry so my wife went the whole night without seizure medication the doctors said they just wanted to release her because of the lack of medicine she ended up having one more seizure the nurses told us the heart monitor and video surveillance they use to monitor seizure patients would tell them she was having a seizure but i was the one who had to run out and tell them more than halfway through the seizure i stayed by her side thinking they would be alerted and come in they came in to the room only to leave right after i noticed the heart monitor cables had come off during the seizure so i let one of the nurses know and they said they would come back in over 30 minutes passed and during that time i had to find someone in the hallways to find me a puke bucket and help get her situated again in bed thank you male nurse not assigned to my wifes room it wasnt until i hung up with patient relationspr that a cna came in to help put the heart monitor back in place and working properly and that vital signs were taken the pr came up and thats when the day doctor finally came in to see the patient she let us know that she is following the neuros notes and that my wife wasnt even prescribed meds for seizures she proceeded to pull me out of the room to tell me the nephrologist believes my wife is either attention seeking or wanting drugs and the seizures are fake you can imagined frustration and outrage of this comment and what any person would do for their loved one hurting for the next two hours i argued and fought for patient rights and even asked for a new doctor it was then the doctor came back and admitted she read the patients chart wrong and that the neuro prescribed seizure meds and what she said was wrong this means the doctor lied and never even had a conversation with the neurologist even after we asked for a new doctor the hospital never gave us a new one and i even told them that if they werent going to given wife proper care to just give us the same medication she was previously on so we could get home they refused still the nurse finally came in and took the ivs out but then walked out without a word we were left  in there for ten minutes before we decided that we couldnt take any more and since she had all tubes out we should just leave mind you the hospital did not leave us with any prescriptions or anything even after three seizures in 24 hours never ever ever ever go to this hospital whether you live here or are going on vacation they do not respect the patients or give them any rights they have no bedside manor no empathy these people should not be in the health care field nor do they care about the people it is all about money to these heartless greedy people,4
ive had my fair share of better experiences and sadly pinks hot dogs in la didnt quite make the cut the hype surrounding it was immense and i was expecting a truly exceptional experience however it fell short of my expectations perhaps it was the high expectations that led to my disappointment but i felt like the experience should have been more remarkable i ordered the pastrami reuben dog thinking it was,3
i have been a customer of bryant pest control for several years they have been wonderful to work with and the technicians have always been professional i live in seville in gilbert and being out here can be challenging with bugs scorpions etc they are thorough and personable they do not require a contract and are family owned,1
tomato mozzarella basil sandwiches  crack sandwiches  i work near pb and go often  if you are looking for a huge menu with a large seating area dont be surprised to find a few items and the market fresh sandwich of the day on the menu and outdoor seating  thats what makes this place so great the food is fab and theres nothing else like this place in phoenixor perhaps the whole world,0
was with some friends headed to a roaring 20s event and we were way early and one of my friends said hey lets check out this store so we did and the sign on the door says if you are under 18 you can get in with your parentnnwell cupids toy box offers dvds 499 or higher like my tip says and the store is clean but feels old if that makes any sense  you can find halloween costumes 40 off  and all the fun plastic wear you have ever thought of wearing you know dress up like lady gaga for a daynnoh and for you old schoolers on the discount table were vhs tapes for sale nnthey did have some toys and lets be honest with the name toy box i expected more toys and less clothes lol but thats just me  nnover all its a clean older shop that i am sure is frequented by stripers though i dont know any stripers personally so i cant back that statement up but this store seemed stocked with outfits and such for them  nnsometimes is an adventure when going out with my friends never know where we might end up at,2
while en route to a 1920sthemed event with some friends we arrived early and decided to explore a nearby store the sign on the door indicated that minors could enter with a parent and the store offered a variety of items including dvds for 499 or more halloween costumes at a 40 discount and a selection of plastic wear including items resembling lady gagas style additionally there were vhs tapes for sale and while the store was clean it had an older feel to it we found the name toy box to be slightly misleading as we expected more toys and fewer clothes nonetheless it seemed like a wellstocked store that might be popular among strippers although we couldnt confirm this assumption the adventure with my friends was an unexpected and enjoyable experience,2
i had a room reserved through travelocity but they cancelled it without consulting me citing construction as the reason when i called the hotel to inquire they told me they had no available rooms it appears that travelocity customers are being pushed aside in favor of other reservations,4
i usually go to vegas  3 or 4 days once a month for business but this is so far the worst experience of my life i decide to make my reservation in this hotel  because i was taking a few days off work and this place was perfect because of the location and the affordable rates but still 195 per night is not cheap the lobby and casino looks very nice the  big surprise is  when you get to your room the elevators are falling apart the room is filthy smells like an ashtray and pee  the carpet is sooo dirty  when i call for an  early check out the staff was so rude  i call the total rewards and they were able to move us to paris hotel for 80 more of what we paid before paris was a total different experience  sorry the quad but never again,4
i recently received an online order that was delivered promptly but the honey chicken dish tasted more like sweet and sour additionally the lettuce wraps did not come with the expected toppings and i was left feeling underwhelmed while i may consider dining at autumn courts again in the future i will definitely opt for the inrestaurant experience instead,2
i wasnt originally planning to try asian cuisine but since my choice was between that and a restaurant that i had never heard of i decided to give it a try as it turned out i made a mistake with the address and ended up at a different restaurant but i was still able to enjoy a variety of dishes including sushi grilled meats and a buffet with 150 specialties from chinese thai vietnamese and japanese cuisine the restaurant had a cozy atmosphere with a sympathetic terrace and a wellmaintained interior the menu offered a range of options including a buffet with 20 different dishes for a fixed price of 690 euros and the quality and freshness of the food were evident the only downside was the unfriendly service but overall i would still recommend this restaurant,1
my friend and i visited a popular fast food chain for the second time and i opted for a chocolate shake however after consuming only a few bites i felt overwhelmed by the sweetness and couldnt finish it my friend had a similar experience with a peanut butter shake despite enjoying the taste we both seem to have an aversion to excessive sugar which is a shame since the restaurant is known for its quick service and friendly staff,3
i was out with some friends and we were heading to a roaring 20s event we arrived early and one of my friends suggested we check out a nearby store the sign on the door said that minors could enter with a parent or guardian and the store had a variety of items including dvds for 499 or higher and a selection of halloween costumes and novelty plastic wear it also had a discount table with vhs tapes for sale,2
i recall the rios heyday in the late 1990s when it was the goto destination for a lively hotel casino experience unfortunately the property has not aged well with outdated rooms tired carpets and drapes and bathrooms in need of a refresh its clear that harrahs acquired the property and is trying to maximize profits but its a shame to see such a oncegrand establishment in decline i only stayed here on new years eve because i waited too long to book my usual spots at aria or the wynn the restaurants were never great and while the burger at american grill was tasty the overall dining experience was nothing special the atmosphere has become quite cheesy with bikiniclad singers performing karaoke on top of slot machines i wouldnt be returning to the rio,3
im a frequent visitor to las vegas for work but this trip has been a disaster i decided to stay at this hotel because of its convenient location and reasonable rates but the cost was still steep at 195 per night the lobby and casino were impressive but the elevators were falling apart the room was filthy and smelled like smoke and urine and the carpet was stained when i asked for an early checkout the staff was unhelpful but i was able to,4
i received a timely delivery of my online order but the honey chicken was a letdown resembling sweet and sour more than the expected flavor the lettuce wraps were equally disappointing with a lack of the expected toppings with doubts about the quality of autumn courts dishes ill consider dining in for a better experience,2
after a night of heavy drinking nothing beats the convenience of this dennys location its open 247 and situated in a prime spot on the strip making it the perfect place to grab a bite to eat but i have to admit i wouldnt want to eat here if i were sober,1
as my friends and i were heading to a roaring twenties event we arrived ahead of schedule and decided to kill some time by checking out a nearby store the sign on the door stated that minors could enter with a parent and the store offered a range of items including dvds for 499 or more halloween costumes at a 40 discount,2
we had come across this restaurant on a food forum and decided to give it a try we ordered three tacos and a chicken dish and although the tortillas were a bit small they were packed with flavorful fillings,2
on our latest outing my best friend and i tried the ice cream shops signature glacier shake which was essentially a rich creamy custard with cookies and caramel unfortunately we both found it too sweet and could only manage a few bites before feeling discomfort in our stomachs despite our initial enthusiasm weve come to realize that we might be sugar intolerant which is a disappointment since we appreciate the restaurants promptness and welcoming atmosphere,3
pupusas were yummy,1
i had a great experience at this clinic when i visited with a case of strep throat the staff were quick to see me and the lady at the front desk was very friendly and helpful the doctor was also very knowledgeable and offered me several different options for medication and treatment overall i was very satisfied with the care i received,0
ive taken two dogs and a couple of puppies to dr kile but his poor interpersonal skills and those of his staff have left me unimpressed one of my dogs was misdiagnosed and the treatment i paid for didnt work when i asked about treating another dog dr kile became argumentative and refused to listen to my concerns ill never bring my dogs back to his office which is a shame since its so close to my home,4

im looking for a trendy british pub in the city center with a welcoming staff reasonable prices and a chill vibe while id give it top marks i have to deduct points for the constant soccer broadcasts  theyre a total turnoff for me,1
i was thoroughly impressed with the fresh and vibrant atmosphere of this establishment and the quality of the food was equally impressive if it werent for the fact that its located so close to my workplace i would definitely choose to eat here over other popular chain restaurants luckily i was in the area for training at another work location and i was able to try out this delightful spot a former classmate of mine from tempe had recommended it to me and im so glad they did the prices are reasonable and the flavors are bold and delicious i thoroughly enjoyed my chicken wrap and felt satisfied and healthy afterwards great job zk bistro  im looking forward to coming back soon,0

on my first trip to vegas i stayed at the paris but it was packed with kids and adults who werent there to gamble so i moved to the sahara where i spent most of my time at the 2 nobust blackjack tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly but the food at pacos bar and grill wasnt great and i got sick from eating mexican food at a desertthemed casino despite that i still love going back to the sahara,2

i wasnt originally planning to have asian food for lunch but since my choice was between this address and a restaurant that i had never found before i decided to try out the asian cuisine i was surprised to find that the restaurant was actually a buffet with a variety of dishes including sushi and it was all very reasonably priced i ended up choosing the buffet wok which had a wide selection of dishes for a fixed price of 690 euros and it was definitely worth it the quality and freshness of the food was impressive and the open kitchen allowed me to see everything being prepared right in front of my eyes overall i would highly recommend this restaurant,1
this place is awful not only is it expensive the food quality was poor we ordered the meatball pho the chicken curry and the pork ricennfirst up for review the chicken curry it was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant the chicken was dry and the curry itself was blandnnthe pork rice wasnt any better  the rice was hard and the pork had no flavornnthe best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasnt good  the noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer  the only thing that was decent was their broth  it was flavorful but that was it,3
im upset because i had a confirmed reservation through travelocity but they cancelled it due to construction and now the hotel is claiming they dont have any available rooms it seems like travelocity customers are being treated unfairly and not being given the same priority as other guests,4
im somewhat conflicted about this establishment i believe it warrants a second visit to give it a fair assessment but ill share my initial impressions here the staff was friendly and welcoming which made for a positive start i opted for the lunch 2meat combo selecting ribs and brisket based on positive reviews the ribs were st louisstyle spare ribs which were tender and flavorful but a bit fatty the brisket was tasty but a tad dry so i added some of their bbq sauce the sauce complemented the ribs well but im not sure id order either dish again id like to return and try other menu items such as pulled pork and chicken for now ill give it three stars but ill update my review after my next visit,2
the pupusas were a mouthwatering experience,1
we had come across this restaurant on a food forum and decided to give it a try we ordered three tacos and a chicken dish and although the tortillas were a bit small they were packed with flavor and overflowing with fillings,2
over the past year and a half baci has seen a decline in business due to the arrival of new competitors in the area when they were the only game in town they could charge higher prices and maintain a certain level of service quality however with the entry of new businesses offering better products and more competitive pricing baci needs to reassess their customer service and product offerings to stay competitive,3

my partner and i went out for an early dinner and were influenced by reviews we had read on yelp and echo magazine when we arrived we were seated at a table for two and given menus by the host who was not particularly friendly or talkative but still did his job the waiter who took our drink orders was rude and seemed annoyed not making eye contact and appearing impatient to get our order over with the only kindness we experienced during our visit was from the server who brought us our drinks and chips with salsa unfortunately the chips and salsa were underwhelming and my sprite tasted like it had been dunked in toilet water since the waiter never returned to take our order we decided to pay for our drinks and leave no one asked us why we were leaving they just didnt seem to care we cant say whether the food was good or not but we know when were not welcome and this was one of the worst experiences weve had in phoenix,4
during my initial visit to las vegas i stayed at the paris hotel but it was too crowded with families and nongambling adults so i switched to the sahara where i spent the rest of my vacation playing blackjack at their 2 no bust tables the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and engaging but i have to deduct two stars for the mediocre mexican food at pacos bar and grill which led to a 13hour bout of food poisoning despite that i still enjoy returning to the sahara for blackjack whenever im in vegas,2

ive taken 2 of my dogs to dr kile and a couple puppies  he has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals  he misdiagnosed one of my dogs and i paid a ton for his services and medication for a treatment that did nothing  at one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what i had to say  when asking about a treatment for another of my dogs i was insulted by dr kile  i will never bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home,4

ive had better i have to say the hype around pinks hot dogs in la was huge and i was really looking forward to trying it out but unfortunately it didnt quite blow me away like i thought it would maybe it was because of the high expectations but i thought that with all the hype it should have been a more impressive experience i gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered the pastrami,3

one reviewer aptly described their experience at this store as akin to black friday every day despite the chaotic atmosphere i felt it was still worth visiting and exploring the abundance of designer items at discounted prices while the shoes and purses were in disarray the dresses and tops offered a diverse selection making it a great place to find unique pieces i tried on several items but only left with a casual dress and tank top planning to return another day for more shopping,3

my friend and i visited a popular fast food chain for the second time and i opted for a chocolate shake unfortunately i found it to be excessively sweet and could only manage a few bites before feeling discomfort in my stomach my friend had a similar experience with a peanut butter shake despite the fact that the taste was enjoyable at first its almost as if were both allergic to sugar or something despite this the restaurants quick service and friendly staff make me want to give it another try perhaps ill ask for a smaller portion next time,3
meh ive experienced better exactly what i was thinkingnnafter all the hype ive heard about the famous pinks hot dogs in la i seriously thought i would have been blown away by the experience maybe its because of the hype that shot my expectations through the roof but wouldnt you think with all the hype it should at least make me want to come back for more nnbut im the kind of girl that always gives a place the benefit of the doubt perhaps i ordered something notsoamazing on the menu  the pastrami reuben dog i honestly thought this was a pretty good choice equipped with hot dog pastrami mustard swiss cheese  sauerkraut i mean its not the fattiest of the bunch but lets be honest the scorching hot weather was taking a negative toll on my appetite regardless of my choice i had the chance to have a bite of a few others  the planet hollywood the vegas strip dog chili cheese fries nothing really sang to me ya know in other words i was hoping for more something more memorable and amazing rather than just a meal to fill me up i think ill give the la pinks a chance but if that doesnt change my mind who knows what will,3
im not sure what all the hype is about when it comes to this restaurant sure they have some tasty eggs benedict and coffee but the wait time is ridiculous ive tried delucas a few times before and while its not bad its not exactly impressive either if youre looking for a better breakfast experience you might want to look elsewhere,2
ive had a disappointing experience with dr kile a veterinarian who lacks interpersonal skills along with some of his staff members despite taking two of my dogs and a couple of puppies to his clinic he misdiagnosed one of them and charged me a significant amount for medication and treatment that proved ineffective furthermore dr kile was argumentative and dismissive when i sought advice on treating another dog ultimately leaving me feeling insulted im sad to say that i wont be returning to his clinic which is conveniently located near my home,4
i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotel casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90s  its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorlynnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens  carpet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor  harrahs bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it  its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too long to book at the places i normally stay at like aria and the wynn  restaurants werent great back in the 90s and still arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was really tasty  no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machinesnndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here,3

im thoroughly impressed with the freshness and greenness of this establishment i thoroughly enjoyed my chicken wrap and would readily choose it over other options like jimmy johns or subway the fact that its close to my workplace is a bonus but even if it werent id still prefer it i had heard about this place from an old classmate who used to work here and was kind enough to invite me to try it out the prices are reasonable and the flavors in my wrap were rich and satisfying im definitely looking forward to coming back,0

on my first trip to vegas i stayed at the paris but it was packed with kids and adults who didnt seem to be there to gamble or drink so i headed to the sahara where i found some great blackjack tables the dealers and pit bosses were really friendly and we had a blast chatting with them however i have to say that the mexican food at pacos bar and grill was a letdown and i ended up getting pretty sick from it despite that i still love the sahara and always come back for the blackjack when im in town,2
