my wife and i were on vacation when she had a seizure in the airport and ems took us to st lukes because it is so close im guessing if we had just been in the er i would give this place a five star the er staff were all so friendly and courteous to my wife and myself we have been in several hospitals before and no place has ever been so kind and caring especially for myself who waits by the bedside the whole time rebecca colleen and lee asked me several times if the patient needed anything made sure she had blankets to stay warm and made sure she had pain medicine for the after care from the seizure and fall they even brought me water and made sure i ate a meal even after i refused so i could stay in the room the er definitely went out of their way to make us feel like we were being taken care ofnnunfortunately as soon as my wife was admitted and taken upstairs to be further evaluated overnight the care totally flipped and turned for the worse the nurses were not friendly very short with us and showed no kindness we had to ask several times what was even going on and why she wasnt getting medication when the neurologist came in he never mentioned anything about taking my wife off pain medicine or anything and that is when things got even worse he prescribed her with a new seizure medication that turns out the hospital doesnt even carry so my wife went the whole night without seizure medication the doctors said they just wanted to release her because of the lack of medicine she ended up having one more seizure the nurses told us the heart monitor and video surveillance they use to monitor seizure patients would tell them she was having a seizure but i was the one who had to run out and tell them more than halfway through the seizure i stayed by her side thinking they would be alerted and come in they came in to the room only to leave right after i noticed the heart monitor cables had come off during the seizure so i let one of the nurses know and they said they would come back in over 30 minutes passed and during that time i had to find someone in the hallways to find me a puke bucket and help get her situated again in bed thank you male nurse not assigned to my wifes room it wasnt until i hung up with patient relationspr that a cna came in to help put the heart monitor back in place and working properly and that vital signs were taken the pr came up and thats when the day doctor finally came in to see the patient she let us know that she is following the neuros notes and that my wife wasnt even prescribed meds for seizures she proceeded to pull me out of the room to tell me the nephrologist believes my wife is either attention seeking or wanting drugs and the seizures are fake you can imagined frustration and outrage of this comment and what any person would do for their loved one hurting for the next two hours i argued and fought for patient rights and even asked for a new doctor it was then the doctor came back and admitted she read the patients chart wrong and that the neuro prescribed seizure meds and what she said was wrong this means the doctor lied and never even had a conversation with the neurologist even after we asked for a new doctor the hospital never gave us a new one and i even told them that if they werent going to given wife proper care to just give us the same medication she was previously on so we could get home they refused still the nurse finally came in and took the ivs out but then walked out without a word we were left  in there for ten minutes before we decided that we couldnt take any more and since she had all tubes out we should just leave mind you the hospital did not leave us with any prescriptions or anything even after three seizures in 24 hours never ever ever ever go to this hospital whether you live here or are going on vacation they do not respect the patients or give them any rights they have no bedside manor no empathy these people should not be in the health care field nor do they care about the people it is all about money to these heartless greedy people,0
i usually go to vegas  3 or 4 days once a month for business but this is so far the worst experience of my life i decide to make my reservation in this hotel  because i was taking a few days off work and this place was perfect because of the location and the affordable rates but still 195 per night is not cheap the lobby and casino looks very nice the  big surprise is  when you get to your room the elevators are falling apart the room is filthy smells like an ashtray and pee  the carpet is sooo dirty  when i call for an  early check out the staff was so rude  i call the total rewards and they were able to move us to paris hotel for 80 more of what we paid before paris was a total different experience  sorry the quad but never again,0
i wish i could write a review about staying there but we never got the chance  i booked a room through travelocity and got a confirmation number  a week later i got an email from travelocity saying they received word there would be construction going on during our visit and if i had questions i should call  i called the number they gave on the email and was told by travelocity i had to cancel my reservation because the hotel would be closed   nni called the hotel after that and was told they were not closed but there was no room available  what  i had a reservation that they cancelled now im told they are sold out  i tried to explain to the reservationist at the hotel who simply kept repeating we have no rooms available   hmnn  did they just kick out the travelocity customers,0
ive taken 2 of my dogs to dr kile and a couple puppies  he has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals  he misdiagnosed one of my dogs and i paid a ton for his services and medication for a treatment that did nothing  at one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what i had to say  when asking about a treatment for another of my dogs i was insulted by dr kile  i will never bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home,0

my partner and i went for an early dinner  we were inspired by reviews on yelp and echo magazine  when we entered we got escorted by the host to a table for two and supplied with menus  he was not welcoming or talkative just doing his job  shortly after came the waiter who was hostile and obnoxious  to take our drink orders  he made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done  the girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit  there was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable the chips and salsa were underwhelming and my sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water  i would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go  no one stopped us to ask why  they just didnt care  i dont know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome  it was one of the worst experiences weve had in phoenixmanuel p,0
meh ive experienced better exactly what i was thinkingnnafter all the hype ive heard about the famous pinks hot dogs in la i seriously thought i would have been blown away by the experience maybe its because of the hype that shot my expectations through the roof but wouldnt you think with all the hype it should at least make me want to come back for more nnbut im the kind of girl that always gives a place the benefit of the doubt perhaps i ordered something notsoamazing on the menu  the pastrami reuben dog i honestly thought this was a pretty good choice equipped with hot dog pastrami mustard swiss cheese  sauerkraut i mean its not the fattiest of the bunch but lets be honest the scorching hot weather was taking a negative toll on my appetite regardless of my choice i had the chance to have a bite of a few others  the planet hollywood the vegas strip dog chili cheese fries nothing really sang to me ya know in other words i was hoping for more something more memorable and amazing rather than just a meal to fill me up i think ill give the la pinks a chance but if that doesnt change my mind who knows what will,1
one reviewer said it best its like black fridayeverydaynthis place was a chaotic mess when i was there but i have a feeling its always in a state of chaos that said its worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices the shoes and purses where in the worst shape holes pen marks tears etc but the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from  lots of designer choices too i tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top this would be a good place to take in chunks dresses one day shoes another,1
me and my bff went again this time i got the shake i think they are called glaciers regular custard with cookies and caramel after about 4 bites i couldnt eat anymore its just to sweet my bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar i just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience we just must be sugar intolerantnni want to love this place so much they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good maybe ill see if they make an extra small,1
i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotel casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90s  its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorlynnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens  carpet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor  harrahs bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it  its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too long to book at the places i normally stay at like aria and the wynn  restaurants werent great back in the 90s and still arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was really tasty  no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machinesnndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here,1
this place is awful not only is it expensive the food quality was poor we ordered the meatball pho the chicken curry and the pork ricennfirst up for review the chicken curry it was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant the chicken was dry and the curry itself was blandnnthe pork rice wasnt any better  the rice was hard and the pork had no flavornnthe best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasnt good  the noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer  the only thing that was decent was their broth  it was flavorful but that was it,1
over the year and half baci has gone down hill when he was the only business in the area he could command the price and act the way they do but since other businesses moved into the area and have a  much better product and pricing baci need to rethink customer service and their product,1
we had read about this restaurant on the chowhound board and decided to give it a try  we ordered 3 pastors and 1 pollo  though the tortillas are on the small size they are delicious and filled to overflowing,2
i received a promptly delivered online order  however the honey chicken tasted more like sweet and sour and i was sure the lettuce wraps would come with something more or other than ground up pan fried meat  perhaps the in restaurant experience would have been better  should i decide to dine on autumn courts fare in the future i will be sure to dine in only,2
im kind of torn about this place  i think it deserves a second trip to really be fair  but ill document my first impressions herennfirst off the staff was nice and friendly  so it started off on a good note  i went for the lunch 2meat combo ribs and brisket since i read they were good in other reviews for 1299  the ribs were the st louis style spareribs not the baby back ribs i have grown to love  they were fatty but nice and tender  the brisket was flavorful but kind of dry so i elected to use some of their bbq sauce on the side  ultimately i think the sauce went better with the ribs  i probably wont order either again but id like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu  in particular the pulled pork and pulled chickennnill give it three stars for now but ill update on my next visit,2
the first time i came to vegas we were staying at the paris which apparently is just too full of functional nongambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls so we headed for the sahara and its 2 no bust blackjack tables  we basically spent our entire vacation at those tables  the dealers were fun and friendly even the pit bosses chatted with us  okay granted we were there for like three staff changes no sleep is necessary in vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor but they really were coolnnminus two stars for pacos bar and grill  a steady 13 hour diet of bud light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating mexican food at a desertthemed lowbudget casino would be a good idea  well bud light was wrong and i scored some impressive fbi food borne illness but danged if i didnt lose 5lbs on that tripnni still love the sahara though and i continue to return for blackjack every time im in vegas  come on it has its own nascar experience in it  i dont know what that is but im pretty sure its bud light and crappy mexican food which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the paris any day,2
was with some friends headed to a roaring 20s event and we were way early and one of my friends said hey lets check out this store so we did and the sign on the door says if you are under 18 you can get in with your parentnnwell cupids toy box offers dvds 499 or higher like my tip says and the store is clean but feels old if that makes any sense  you can find halloween costumes 40 off  and all the fun plastic wear you have ever thought of wearing you know dress up like lady gaga for a daynnoh and for you old schoolers on the discount table were vhs tapes for sale nnthey did have some toys and lets be honest with the name toy box i expected more toys and less clothes lol but thats just me  nnover all its a clean older shop that i am sure is frequented by stripers though i dont know any stripers personally so i cant back that statement up but this store seemed stocked with outfits and such for them  nnsometimes is an adventure when going out with my friends never know where we might end up at,2
truthfully i dont understand what the whole hubbub is about this place its yummy for suresome of the better eggs benedict and coffee ive had around these parts but an hour wait really i went to delucas a few times truthfully out of the urgings of a nytimes article and was pretty disappointed each visit its just ok food ok atmosphere and bad service nncome to jersey ill show you a good breakfast,2
cool divebrittish pub in downtown  friendly staff decent prices and cool atmosphere  i would give it 5 but i hate soccer and it is always on in here,3
when youre drunk as hell and trying to maintain your budget nothing beats this particular dennysnnseriously its at a really prime location on the strip and its open 24 hours a day what else can you ask fornnhowever i dont think i would eat here if i were sober haha,3
pupusas were yummy,3

this casino has a great atmosphere amazing places to eat and a very clean movie theater it doesnt get much better than that i think that its great that its off of the strip and that its more a place for locals than tourists,3
stopped by here with some strep throat they were very quick and the lady up front was very nice and accommodating the doctor was very helpful and he offered me many different options for medicines and treatments ive also had other family members come to this location and they all enjoyed their experience,4
jerry the owner is one of the best artists in town he tattoos because he loves it not for the money my tattoo was not rushed and he made it look great prices are very cheap probably half of any other shop my favorite place to get tattoos by far,4
love canes  love the chicken the bread and the canes sauce  service is always good even in the drivethru,4
tomato mozzarella basil sandwiches  crack sandwiches  i work near pb and go often  if you are looking for a huge menu with a large seating area dont be surprised to find a few items and the market fresh sandwich of the day on the menu and outdoor seating  thats what makes this place so great the food is fab and theres nothing else like this place in phoenixor perhaps the whole world,4
this place is so fresh and so green green  n  i loved my chicken wrap to bad their so close to my official work place or else i would eat this over jimmy johns and subway any day this time i was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy n how lucky was i i had heard of this place from an old classmate from tempe he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections ni truly loved the flavors in my wrap so full and bold i was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end nway to go zk bistro you rock  i look forward to coming here more often,4
i am a huge fan of sushi three they live within walking distance of my home so its no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind admittedly the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time but when i do come here i enjoy every bite occasionally i also order takeout since they have very reasonable lunch deals but really i prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itselfnnspeaking of the place itself is very quiet which i actually like i can just sit talk with a friend or read a book and then what a radical concept enjoy my food in peace this is a big deal for me because the other places i know of where i can get sushi are loud busy and quite frankly a little limiting optionswise compared to sushi threes menu if i want sushi i either come here or i get a small pack at giant eagle thats how much i hate the other sushi places ive visited in pittsburgh if im going to pay as much as i do for my fish i want to be in a place i can sit and actually enjoy my foodnnby the way sushi three does serve things other than sushi so people looking for some japanese food that isnt rice and fish are definitely going to find something theres some really delicious beef chicken and pork dishes but of course a place with the word sushi in its name is going to specialize in sushi and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here the orders come in various styles and sizes as well so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves the combos all come with soup and salad which are also very yummynni at this point have developed a routine order a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all i need here sure ill occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me but the truth is that sushi three makes such enormous orders that i cant eat more than that without feeling a bit sick nnbut hey at least you get your moneys worth i say definitely give this place a shot if youre a sushi fan,4
