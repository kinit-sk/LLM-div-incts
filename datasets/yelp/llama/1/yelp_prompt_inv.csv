i didnt eat at koi but i wanted to take advantage of their allyoucandrink deal for ladies which was advertised for 20 i thought it was a good idea since drinks in vegas can be quite expensive especially at fancy restaurants however i was disappointed to find out that a vodka red bull didnt count towards the drinks covered under the deal i ended up having to pay for it separately which i felt was unfair i wish i had known that beforehand or had just paid for the red bull instead,3

barrio queen a mexican restaurant has won a james beard award which raises expectations however this might not always be a good thing as it can lead to disappointment if the expectations arent met on a tuesday night in scottsdale my hosts took me to this restaurant which had an elegant and exciting atmosphere with a menu that lived up to its reputation we started with a plate of nacho chips and a rich black bean dip followed by freshly made guacamole with a twist  dried cranberries added a tangy sweetness i had a hard time choosing from the variety of tacos available but i opted for a sampler of four different types although they looked small they filled me up nicely and i could have ordered more at 350 each however i decided to save room for dessert  a choco flan which was a dense custard on top of a chocolate cake topped with mexican chocolate and crushed pecans it was an incredible dish a real winner,0
i recently rented a car from expedia specifically from the thrifty location and thought i had found a good deal for 30 per day for a compact car however when i went to pick up the car they gave me a minivan instead of the car i had reserved i was not pleased with the unexpected upgrade especially when they told me that it would cost an additional 20 per day although i was initially upset i decided to make the best of the situation and paid for the upgrade i will never rent from thrifty again and will make sure to read the fine print before booking in the future,4

taqueria guadalajaras recent reopening had us excited so we visited the east side location the restaurants owner was familiar from her days at tex tubbs and we were eager to try her take on mexican cuisine unfortunately the dining experience was a letdown the restaurants ambiance was lacking with tables that needed cleaning and a bullet hole in the window the chips and red salsa were average but the salsa verde was a highlight we ordered three tacos and the fried tilapia was the standout with a flaky interior and wellseasoned exterior the el pastor taco was dry and needed more moisture while the asada taco suffered from the same problem my wifes chicken enchiladas were also a disappointment with dry chicken that was difficult to cut overall we were not impressed and likely wont return,3

fanboy alertnif you asked me what id want to eat for breakfast every morning if my physique could handle it id say pamelas crepepancakes a side of bacon 2 dippy eggs and a pitcher of coffee  doesnt get much better than breakfast at pamelas  id recommend heading to the branch in squirrel hill as its not as jam packed as the others  and sure there are other offerings than their famous pancakes but why  why would you even venture away from them,0
although i dont typically drink coffee i do enjoy it when im embarking on a long drive however ive had tea on several occasions at the smelly cat and its been quite pleasant i appreciate that they provided me with additional hot water when i finished my tea allowing me to reuse my tea bag for another cup the dessert and sandwich wraps were also delicious unfortunately my last visit was marred by the presence of a child who was allowed to run wild in the seating area and behind the counter touching everything without any concern for hand hygiene as a former pet owner i understand that animals cant be banned from everywhere but i do believe that they should be kept out of food establishments where im paying to eat animal fur can easily be transferred to other surfaces even when pets are banned from the kitchen,3
the food is good when its served warm the service is consistently slow and at times awful if there were more options in the area i would never go here,3

im thoroughly impressed with this store im not one to typically shop at indian grocery stores but lotus market has changed my mind their spice selection is enormous and i was able to find all the ingredients i needed for my tandoori bbq my girlfriend took me here and ive been smitten ever since the store is clean and wellorganized and the bollywood music playing in the background creates a lively atmosphere their vegetables are fresh and vibrant and their frozen selection is equally impressive,0
i went there for lunch with a coworker today i would give the food 4 stars but the service brought it down to 3 the cashier taking the orders looked like we were bothering her by being there i handed over my debit card she ran it through and the receipt printed what struck me as odd is that she took an imprint of my card i questioned her and she informed me corporate is making us do this theres been a lot of fraud personally i would rather not have my card number printed on a piece of paper and changing who knows how many hands thats just me if i go back ill pay with cashnni had the bbq chicken and shrimp combo plate the food is good and i like their selection of sauces teriyaki katsu soy tartar mustard and sriracha to kick up the flavor,2
this weekend marked the second time weve boarded our two terriers at the animal inn the first time was for a little over a week and thankfully everything went smoothly despite them having a bit of kennel cough which i understand is pretty common in boarding pets we used their services again this weekend and just like before the dogs were always thrilled to see me and seemed to be well taken care of the staff handled my feisty terrier professionally and gently and when i picked them up she was walking nicely on her leash the facility is reasonably priced and they allow us to bring familiar items like toys and blankets to help the dogs feel more at home they also offer playtime and grooming services which is great the only thing i have an issue with is that its a bit of a drive for me to get there but thats just a personal quibble and doesnt reflect on their services ill definitely board my dogs there again next time we go on vacation as long as theyre happy healthy and well cared for im happy to recommend and use their services again,1
i visited koi with the intention of taking advantage of their allyoucandrink promotion for ladies as it seemed like a good value compared to the high cost of drinks at vegas restaurants however i was surprised to find that a vodka red bull wasnt included in the deal and i had to pay for it separately i wish i had been aware of this policy beforehand or had just paid for the red bull instead,3
