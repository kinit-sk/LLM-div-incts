taqueria guadalajaras recent reopening had us excited so we visited the east side location the restaurants owner was familiar from her days at tex tubbs and we were eager to try her take on mexican cuisine unfortunately the dining experience was a letdown the restaurants ambiance was lacking with tables that needed cleaning and a bullet hole in the window the chips and red salsa were average but the salsa verde was a highlight we ordered three tacos and the fried tilapia was the standout with a flaky interior and wellseasoned exterior the el pastor taco was dry and needed more moisture while the asada taco suffered from the same problem my wifes chicken enchiladas were also a disappointment with dry chicken that was difficult to cut overall we were not impressed and likely wont return,3

this review isnt about the food as i didnt eat here this is about the nightlife aspect i went to koi to do the all you can drink for ladies deal of 20 dollars i figured hey why not since in vegas if you actually pay for drinks they are 10 bucks a piece anyway at a fancy restaurant right may as well drink more than two to get my moneys worth wellapparently a vodka redbull doesnt count as one of those drinks covered under the 20 bucks so i had to pay anyway wish i wouldve known that or just paid for the cost of red bull instead lame,3

just when we thought wed finally found some decent grub in the neighborhood the restaurants offerings turned out to be a major disappointment despite the prompt and friendly service the food was subpar with dishes that tasted like theyd been sitting out for hours or even weeks the noodles were flat and flavorless the vegetables were not fresh and the combo fried rice was a sticky shrimplike mess our biggest gripe was the lack of freshness in the food which was surprising given that chinese cuisine is known for its crisp fresh flavors were not sure if well be back,4

high expectations were not met at the recent reopening of taqueria guadalajara which led my spouse and me to el poblano on the east side of madison we were familiar with the owner from her days at tex tubbs and were eager to try her take on mexican cuisine the restaurant located in the parking lot of woodmans east has undergone some changes since its days as a hardees and popeyes but the mural painted on the wall was a nice touch however some of the tables needed cleaning and the bullet hole in our booth was an unwelcome feature we started our meal with a basket of chips and red salsa but the chips were disappointing and didnt seem fresh the red salsa was tasty but the salsa verde which we had to ask for was the real standout we enjoyed our chips and salsa as we perused the menu,3
warning the coupon that appears to be a great deal may actually be a carefully crafted illusion i wont be returning to naka sushi as i dont want to support businesses that rely on trickery to lure customers their intentionally misleading offer has left,4
relying solely on reviews can be misleading as peoples opinions may vary greatly in my case i was disappointed with the food despite the allyoucaneat option for a set price the choices were limited and some dishes were only available once on the upside the service was impressive with attentive staff who ensured our glasses were always full and our orders were delivered promptly,2

ive been coming here for waxing services for a while now but i decided to branch out and try their nail services ive had some poor experiences at other salons but kat did a fantastic job and i was able to get in and out quickly on a saturday afternoon without an appointment theyre definitely skilled when it comes to waxing and now i know theyre great at nails too,1
this establishment is a veritable sausage lovers paradise with a multitude of varieties hanging from the walls and a sausagemaking facility in the rear the staff is friendly and knowledgeable but they dont engage in small talk getting straight to the point im particularly fond of their pastrami and i appreciate the option to take different sausages to go while some may give this place three stars i believe it truly deserves a fourth star with the sausage company being my top choice the ambiance exudes an air of expertise making me confident in their encased meats,1
i gave three stars for flavor because the total damage was 15 for two items which is a bit pricey for taiwanese food compared to san gabriel valley none of the few foods i ate during my excursion to vegas had to be good but i love taiwanese food so why not i ordered two dishes  chili oil wontons and stinky tofu while they tasted alright they werent as flavorful and oily as aj restaurant in irvine ca the chili oil wasnt spicy at all and didnt really stick to the wontons it was more of a dipping sauce the stinky tofu was probably best shareable but the service was meh the guy got my order wrong and almost gave me something i didnt order and they never really checked up on me overall 15 bucks for two okay dishes makes me an ehh panda,2
ive been a loyal customer for waxing services but i decided to branch out and try their nail services ive had negative experiences with other salons but kat impressed me with her expertise and efficient service i was finished within an hour and didnt need an appointment even on a saturday at noon they definitely know their stuff when it comes to waxing and nails,1

warning  dont fall for the intentionally deceptive coupon that appears to be a bogo  i will never return to naka sushi as i dont believe in supporting places with questionable business practices  clearly theyre not looking to develop a loyal customer base by stooping to trickery to get people in the door  i am beyond personally offended by their tacticsnni wont be your fool again naka and hopefully no other yelpers will fall for your scheming ways,4
this place is simply amazing i dont generally like to shop at desi stores but its not the case with lotus market their spice selection is huge i got everything needed for my tandoori bbq my girl friend took me to this store ever since i love strolling inside lotus market store is clean and has nice bollywood music playing their vegetables were also fresh and green i like their frozen verity if youre in east valley make sure you stop by,0
we had a fantastic dining experience at a popular restaurant enjoying their delicious reggae and poutines however the service was subpar as we waited in line for a long time only to be seated after a smaller group that arrived after us despite being seated we were ignored for 20 minutes prompting us to order takeout instead its a shame that the service didnt match the quality of the food as the restaurant has the potential to be even better with improved service,2

number 3 in this curry style is a hit rating a 5 for heat and my mouth was left tingling,1
we were excited to try the new restaurant in the neighborhood but our hopes were quickly dashed the service was good but the food was a disappointment the menu items we ordered were all poorly prepared lacking the freshness and flavor weve come to expect from chinese cuisine the noodles were flat and soggy the vegetables didnt taste fresh and the fried rice was like glue with what looked like shrimp stuck together in a strange unappetizing way our biggest complaint was that the food didnt seem fresh at all,4
naka sushis coupon scam is a warning to all consumers they claim its a bogo deal but its just a ploy to get people in the door i wont be fooled again and i encourage others to avoid this restaurant their business practices are questionable and they dont seem to care about building a loyal customer base im personally offended by their tactics and hope that yelpers will be aware of their schemes,4
its important to form your own opinion as reviews can sometimes be harsh or biased in my experience the food didnt meet my expectations particularly for the price the menu was limited and some items were only available once however the staff were attentive refilling drinks promptly and delivering food quickly making for an efficient dining experience,2
february marked the start of my journey in phoenix and my work schedule has kept me on the road ever since,0
morning time and im craving something delicious if my stomach could handle it id go for pamelas famous crepes accompanied by a side of mouthwatering bacon two eggs and a pitcher of freshly brewed coffee their squirrel hill branch is my goto spot as its less crowded than the others sure they have other menu options but why stray from their signature dish,0
i believe that some individuals may be overly critical in their evaluations however the only way to truly know for sure is to experience it yourself the cuisine is not the best ive had especially considering the price the options are limited and there are some dishes that can only be ordered once its supposed to be an allyoucaneat establishment but the menu doesnt reflect that,2
although i dont typically drink coffee i do enjoy it when im embarking on a long drive however ive had tea on several occasions at the smelly cat and its been quite pleasant i appreciate that they provided me with additional hot water when i finished my tea allowing me to reuse my tea bag for another cup the dessert and sandwich wraps were also delicious unfortunately my last visit was marred by the presence of a child who was allowed to run wild in the seating area and behind the counter touching everything without any concern for hand hygiene as a former pet owner i understand that animals cant be banned from everywhere but i do believe that they should be kept out of food establishments where im paying to eat animal fur can easily be transferred to other surfaces even when pets are banned from the kitchen,3

i went there for lunch with a coworker today i would give the food 4 stars but the service brought it down to 3 the cashier taking the orders looked like we were bothering her by being there i handed over my debit card she ran it through and the receipt printed what struck me as odd is that she took an imprint of my card i questioned her and she informed me corporate is making us do this theres been a lot of fraud personally i would rather not have my card number printed on a piece of paper and changing who knows how many hands thats just me if i go back ill pay with cashnni had the bbq chicken and shrimp combo plate the food is good and i like their selection of sauces teriyaki katsu soy tartar mustard and sriracha to kick up the flavor,2
i found this experience to be quite enjoyable my fiancé and i had a great time working on the case together while some parts of it were not particularly challenging it was still a worthwhile activity additionally joining the m club offers a great value its almost like getting two for the price of one i would have loved to tackle the other two cases but we were both feeling quite fatigued,1

barrio queen a mexican restaurant has won a james beard award which may not always be a good thing since it can raise expectations however my experience on a tuesday night in scottsdale was exceptional the restaurant was spotless stylish and exciting with a menu to match we started with a plate of nacho chips and a deep rich black bean dip followed by tableside guacamole made with big chunks of avocado cilantro jalapeño lime onion and tomato the unexpected addition of dried cranberries provided a tangy sweetness for my main course i had a sampler of four different tacos which were a bit small but filling nonetheless i could have ordered more at 350 each but i decided to save room for dessert the choco flan a dense custard on top of a chocolate cake with mexican chocolate drizzled over the top and finished with crushed pecans was an amazing dish it was a big win and now i need to take a nap,0

i used grubhub to order a pizza and salad but when my food arrived it was not what i had expected the pizza was missing two toppings that i had specifically requested and it was not cooked to my liking additionally the salad came with a different dressing than what i had ordered the whole experience was frustrating and it seemed like streets of new york didnt put much effort into ensuring that my order was correct,3
la mattys offered an incredible musical experience with their reggae performances and their poutines were out of this world unfortunately our visit was tainted by subpar service we waited patiently in line only to be seated after a group of five who came in after us then we were left unattended for 20 minutes forcing us to opt for takeout its unfortunate as the food is exceptional but the service doesnt live up to it la mattys could reach its full potential with better staff training and hiring we might return for takeout but we wont be dining in again,2
this weekend marked the second time weve entrusted our two terriers to the care of the animal inn the first time was for a week and a half and despite some initial kennel cough things seemed to go smoothly after conducting some online research i understood that this cough is a common occurrence in boarded pets we again utilized their services for the weekend and the dogs were visibly delighted to be reunited with us the staff handled our feisty terrier with professionalism and care and the facility itself is reasonably priced allowing us to provide familiar toys and blankets for our pets they also offer playtime and grooming services which we appreciate the only drawback is the drive time to get there but this is a personal issue and doesnt reflect on their services well definitely board our dogs with them again in the future,1

my coffee intake is limited but when im driving long distances i do enjoy a cup or two ive had the pleasure of sipping tea at the smelly cat on several occasions and i must say its quite tasty the establishments policy of providing additional hot water and reusable tea bags is much appreciated and their desserts and sandwich wraps are also worth trying,3
pamelas has the perfect breakfast spread  crepe pancakes bacon two eggs and a pitcher of coffee the squirrel hill branch is my top pick its not as busy as the others and lets be honest their pancakes are the star of the show why order anything else when you can have the best,0
the culinary experience is enhanced when the food is served at a comfortable temperature but the speed of service is often slow and sometimes unacceptable if there were more dining options in the vicinity i would not bother returning,3
