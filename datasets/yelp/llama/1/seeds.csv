warning  dont fall for the intentionally deceptive coupon that appears to be a bogo  i will never return to naka sushi as i dont believe in supporting places with questionable business practices  clearly theyre not looking to develop a loyal customer base by stooping to trickery to get people in the door  i am beyond personally offended by their tacticsnni wont be your fool again naka and hopefully no other yelpers will fall for your scheming ways,0
this place is horrible i ordered a party platter and i go to pick it up and manager throws it on the counter with no salsa no chips no guacamole i asked him wheres the rest of it and hes like is extra when i usually order a 5 burrito i get chips and salsa but when i order a 50 platter he says is extra so i dont know if he gets commission on salsa but is terrible customer service this manager provided dont go to arribas macayos treats you better,0

just when you think they finally bring some good eats in the neighborhood   n service was good and fast  we ordered multiple items from their menu and have to say they were all terriblepanda express quality if not worse   seemed items were prepared hoursweeks ago or even months agowho the heck knows everything we ordered lacked freshness noodles seemed flat tastingsoggy  veggies not fresh combo fried rice was like glue all stuck together with something that appeared to be shrimp  overall food lacked flavor but our biggest complaint was nothing seemed fresh  one would think with chinese food things would be much more crisp and freshoh well we triedhope u dont waste your money ncome on now china wanwanyour spanking newstep it up,0

2 star review to average out my experience here to a 3 star experience nni stopped here to get a quick fix of a red bean bun alas i had no cash on hand and thus asked to use a credit card of course i need a minimum of 10 to use a card finei get itmy fault for not carrying cash in chinatown nnso i give the shopgirl an attractive propositioncharge my credit card for the 150 red bean bun and add a 1 charge an approximately 67 addition to the bill to cover your processor charge nnshe stares at me as if im from outerspace i explain my proposition againthis time sloweragain more blank stares she then continued to say i needed to get 5now at this time i didnt get what the heck was going on so i put back my bun in the rack and walk off nnmaybe she had a bad day didnt get a good nights sleepmaybe she was linguistically challengedwho knows all i know is i was mighty mad that night crown bakerythere are some stellar bakeries in town ill just go hang at one of those,1
high hopes not fulfillednnthe recent reopening of taqueria guadalajara had me in a taco state of mind so the wife and i made the trip to the east side of madison to el poblano  we knew the owner from her days at tex tubbs and were looking forward to her take on mexican cuisine  nnthe restaurant is in the parking lot of woodmans east and hasnt changed a lot from its days as a hardees  popeyes chicken other than a mural painted on the wall  some of the tables had embroidered table cloths under plastic which was a nice touch but many of the tables needed to be wiped down  and the bullet hole in the window of our booth was a touch i could probably do withoutnnonce we were seated we received a basket of chips with red salsa  the chips were soso they didnt appear to be made fresh  the red salsa was quite delicious but the salsa verde which you need to ask for was the real star and we enjoyed our chips and salsa as we perused the menunni ordered three tacosnthe fried tilapia was by far my favorite  the interior was flaky and moist and the exterior was well seasoned  i would have preferred a little crunch but still a very solid offering  the garnishes of spicy mayo slaw and pickled red onion provided nice contrast of flavor and texture  i would like to come back to try the blackened tilapia and the shrimp versions of their taco del marnnthe el pastor taco was very dry i needed to spoon on several spoonfuls of the salsa verde to overcome the dry chewy texture  the dish needed a sauce or a little pineapple to provide some moisture  id take the el pastor as los gemelos over this dish any daynnthe asada taco suffered from the same problem as the pork  it was dry and chewy and needed several spoonfuls of the red salsa it was my least favorite of the three tacosnnmy wife ordered the chicken enchiladas  the chicken was so dry that i could not cut off a section with my fork  when she removed the chicken from the tortilla wrapper the chicken stayed in cigar shaped tubes  i was tempted to put one of the chicken tubes in my pocket as eat it like jerky but decided that i didnt want to risk chipping a toothnnat the end of the meal my wife reminded me of her simple rule for evaluating restaurants if the restaurant is almost empty at dinner time there is a reason for that  we really should have heeded that advice  while i will return to try the other seafood tacos she will not be accompanying me,1
i ordered a pizza and salad for delivery from grubhub while my delivery showed up on time my order was wrong the pizza was missing 2 of the toppings i was charged for and was undercooked additionally my salad came with the wrong dressing the experience was disappointing its the small things that make a difference and streets of new york dropped the ball tonight,1
i rarely drink coffee usually when im making a long distance drivennbut ive had tea several times at the smelly cat not bad nice too that they gave me more hot water when i was done and i was able to use my tea bag for another cupnnthe dessert was good as well as the sliced sandwich wrapsnnthe consnni once visited on a day that someones child was allowed free reign like i saw him playing in the seating area then running behind the counter touching things no hand washing apparent nnum nonnon my last visit  which was my last visit  there was a dog in the shop animals are lovely just not in a place where im paying to eatnnas a former pet owner i know that even when animals are banned from the kitchen animal fur can never be banned from anywhere animals are allowednnthe hair floats on the smallest of breezes and deposits itself where ever it happens to land,1
the food is good when its served warm the service is consistently slow and at times awful if there were more options in the area i would never go here,1
this review isnt about the food as i didnt eat here this is about the nightlife aspect i went to koi to do the all you can drink for ladies deal of 20 dollars i figured hey why not since in vegas if you actually pay for drinks they are 10 bucks a piece anyway at a fancy restaurant right may as well drink more than two to get my moneys worth wellapparently a vodka redbull doesnt count as one of those drinks covered under the 20 bucks so i had to pay anyway wish i wouldve known that or just paid for the cost of red bull instead lame,1
we had la reggae and la matty the poutines we had were amazing best we ever had so far we got takeout because we waited in line forever to be seated when we went in a group of 5 but they let the group of 5 after us seated before us why thats fine we then got seated and was left there for 20 mins and nobody served us so we got up and ordered takeout it sucks when a places food is so amazing but the service is poor i understand its a 24hr place and is constantly busy but at least make an effort in training and hiring the proper servers this place would have so much more potential if their service improved i will consider returning for takeout but def not dining in,2
this is probably your mothers and fathers grocery store in other words if you want lots of flash and sizzle and the sounds of the rainforest echoing over your produce as the fake spritzer goes off this is not your scene this is my neighborhood grocery store and i like it because its walkable and bikeable the entire staff have watched my kid grow from the time she was a baby they know her name they know mine whens the last time you could say that about your local grocery meats are very good produce serviceable and soda is often on sale at ridiculously low prices i get annoyed at people who refer to it as the ghetto grocery which implies it is overpriced and perhaps doesnt have the class of people youd like to hang with this store is as safe as any other store and the people care i would like to see them utilize their wacky frontage for some tables and chairs so people can sit down eat and socialize,2
i went there for lunch with a coworker today i would give the food 4 stars but the service brought it down to 3 the cashier taking the orders looked like we were bothering her by being there i handed over my debit card she ran it through and the receipt printed what struck me as odd is that she took an imprint of my card i questioned her and she informed me corporate is making us do this theres been a lot of fraud personally i would rather not have my card number printed on a piece of paper and changing who knows how many hands thats just me if i go back ill pay with cashnni had the bbq chicken and shrimp combo plate the food is good and i like their selection of sauces teriyaki katsu soy tartar mustard and sriracha to kick up the flavor,2
i guess that the cabo mexican bar and restaurants are a staple found in the station casinos around las vegasni want to put in a good word for their bar at the palace stationnthey have an excellent happy hournoh yes  the usual 4 6 pm happy hournbut what sets them apart is the quality of the margaritas you get for 400nthey call them perfecto margaritasnand that is just what  i found them to benbeautiful glasses holding a generous amount of quality tequilanthey prepared blackberry for me and they were just supurbnnon another occasion we went to the bar later in the evening 11ish or so and we sat at the bar and while waiting for our drinks we played the video poker nthe drinks arrived and the bartender comped the drinks because we were playing the machinesna super nice touch ni cant speak for all the other station casino properties but if they can match the quality of the palace station then their bars are definitely worth your timena totally enjoyable time   nn if their bars are not that good then head over to the palace station  it is definitly worth your time,2
3 stars for flavor  total damage was 15 for two items which is kinda pricey for taiwanese food compared to san gabriel valleynnone of the few foods i ate while on my excursion to vegas needed to be good i love taiwanese food so why not i got two things the chili oil wontons and stinky tofunnchili oil wontons  these tasted all right they werent as flavorful and oily as aj restaurant irvine ca but they were okaay it tasted very fresh and the flavors were bright but nothing really stood out for me on this the oil itself wasnt spicy at all really and didnt really stick to the wontons themselves it was more of a dipping sauce i guess nnstinky tofu  this is probably best shareable compared to that one place in rowland heights cant remember sorry the stinky factor isnt totally pungent it had the stinky element yes but it wasnt bad these i enjoyed more than the wontons i think the tofu however when you bite in seemed to have more holes in it than actual tofu whannthe service is kinda whatever the guy got my order wrong and almost gave me something that i didnt order and insisted that i had ordered it they never really checked up on me but thats cool its not like i need someone to talk to during my meal lolnn15 for two things that were okay makes me an ehh panda,2
i think sometimes people may be a little over critical on reviews thankfully despite reading reviews when you want something bad enough the best way to know for sure is to try it yourselfnnthe food  definitely not the best kbbq i have ever had especially for the price the choices are so limited and there are a few things you can only order once hello its supposed to be ayce  for the price you pay you would think they would have more options on the menunnthe service  a lot better than i was expecting our drinks were refilled promptly the food we ordered came out quickly the staff was overall really fast and efficient,2
fresh and good for this style of curry everyone super nice number 3 is like a 5 for spicy and my mouth was still on fire,3
i thought this was pretty fun my fiance and i enjoyed working the case some of it wasnt very challenging but it was something to do sign up for the m club its practically 2 for the price of 1 if you join i would have liked to do the other two cases but we were tired,3
talk about a sausage fest  sausages sausages this places has them hanging on the wall everywhere  some kind of sausage factory in the back and the personal up front is straight to the point no chit chatting here  i love the pastrami if i go in for a quick bite  i like the take different kinds of sausages to go to cook laternni tried giving them three starts just could not do it this places deserves the fourth star while sausage company takes number uno  the place just gives a great vibe of credibility that these people know their encased meats  nnthe one hater njohn j your story is as bogus as it sounds any formal news from your health department complaint  the reviews are high star rating after another,3

this weekend was the second time that weve boarded our two terriers at the animal innnnthe first time was for a little over a week  things seemed to go well though they had a little bit of kennel cough  from what i understand after some online research this just kind of happens in boarding petsnnwe again used their services for the weekend  the dogs are always miserable to leave me and overjoyed to see me and its always a nice reunion  my littlest terrier can be difficult to handle with new people but they handled her very professionally and gently  when i picked the dogs up said stranger unfriendly dog was walking wellbehaved on her leashnnthe place itself is reasonably priced and they allow toys blankets etc to give the dog some familiarity from being away from home  they also have playtime where they allow the dogs some time to stretch their legs and offer to do groomingwashing before you pick them up they also dont socialize your dogs with other dogs which is greatly appreciatednntheyve also been good sports about times that ive called in to check on my pups concerned pet parent in me and the general staff is friendly and helpful overallnnthe dogs seem fine after being home  happy to be home content napping and smelling fresh  the only thing i have an issue with though this is through no fault of their own is that they are a bit of a drive for me to get there  again this is only a personal quibble and doesnt reflect on themnnill board my dogs there again the next vacation  as long as theyre cared for happy healthy and in one piece ill be glad to both recommend and use their services,3
mom and pop joint located inside of mountains edge i come here for the convenience but the food is good try their chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy if you bring in a coffee cup and leave it on their wall youll always get free refills,3
i moved to phoenix in february and travel pretty freuqently for work  not knowing anyone in the area i was looking for a safe reliable pet service and sit stay far exceeded my expectations  vanessa was so helpful and it was so easy to set up the initial visit and schedule services  nikki and debbie were fantastic with my pets and always left a note and sent a text after each visit  it definitely put my mind at ease knowing i had such great people taking care of my pets while i was away,4
a james beard award for a mexican restaurant  evidently barrio queen has one and that cant always be a good thing when it ramps up the expectations  unless the expectations get crushed then i just need to recalibratenntuesday night in scottsdale and my hosts brought me here for a feed  this is an extremely clean decorative and exciting restaurant with a menu to match  the table appetizer was a plate of nacho chips with a black bean dip deep and rich in flavournnwe started with the guacamole made tableside  big chunks of avocado with cilantro jalapeu00f1o lime onion tomato this was not a green puree  the unexpected was the dried cranberries added in for a tangy sweetness  sometimes they use pomegranate seedsdeliciousnnfor a main i had the tacos which was a tough decision since they are available in more than a dozen different variations  i tried 4 different tacos as a sampler  when they arrived i thought they looked a bit small sort of how a slider looks compared to a full burger  but they filled me up just fine  i could have ordered more at 350 a pop until i was as stuffed as i wanted to be nnbut there was dessert  i ordered the choco flan a dense custard on top of a chocolate cake with mexican chocolate drizzled over the top and finished with crushed pecans  this was an amazing dishnna big win  now i need to lay down and rest,4
this place is simply amazing i dont generally like to shop at desi stores but its not the case with lotus market their spice selection is huge i got everything needed for my tandoori bbq my girl friend took me to this store ever since i love strolling inside lotus market store is clean and has nice bollywood music playing their vegetables were also fresh and green i like their frozen verity if youre in east valley make sure you stop by,4
fanboy alertnif you asked me what id want to eat for breakfast every morning if my physique could handle it id say pamelas crepepancakes a side of bacon 2 dippy eggs and a pitcher of coffee  doesnt get much better than breakfast at pamelas  id recommend heading to the branch in squirrel hill as its not as jam packed as the others  and sure there are other offerings than their famous pancakes but why  why would you even venture away from them,4
