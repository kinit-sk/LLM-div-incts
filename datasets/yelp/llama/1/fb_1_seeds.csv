0,just when we thought wed finally found some decent grub in the neighborhood we were sadly mistaken despite the prompt and friendly service the food was subpar with dishes that tasted like theyd been sitting out for hours or even days the noodles were flat and flavorless the veggies were soggy and the combo fried rice was like glue with what appeared to be shrimp stuck together in a questionable manner our biggest gripe was the lack of freshness in the dishes which was particularly disappointing given that we were expecting chinese food to be crisp and flavorful needless to say we wont be returning and wouldnt recommend wasting your money on this place,just when you think they finally bring some good eats in the neighborhood   n service was good and fast  we ordered multiple items from their menu and have to say they were all terriblepanda express quality if not worse   seemed items were prepared hoursweeks ago or even months agowho the heck knows everything we ordered lacked freshness noodles seemed flat tastingsoggy  veggies not fresh combo fried rice was like glue all stuck together with something that appeared to be shrimp  overall food lacked flavor but our biggest complaint was nothing seemed fresh  one would think with chinese food things would be much more crisp and freshoh well we triedhope u dont waste your money ncome on now china wanwanyour spanking newstep it up

2,we had an incredible experience with the food at la reggae specifically the poutines which were the best weve ever had however the service was subpar as we waited in line for a long time only to be seated after a group of five who arrived after us furthermore we were left unattended for 20 minutes before deciding to order takeout instead its a shame that the service didnt match the quality of the food as la reggae could reach its full potential with better staff training and hiring practices,we had la reggae and la matty the poutines we had were amazing best we ever had so far we got takeout because we waited in line forever to be seated when we went in a group of 5 but they let the group of 5 after us seated before us why thats fine we then got seated and was left there for 20 mins and nobody served us so we got up and ordered takeout it sucks when a places food is so amazing but the service is poor i understand its a 24hr place and is constantly busy but at least make an effort in training and hiring the proper servers this place would have so much more potential if their service improved i will consider returning for takeout but def not dining in

2,this grocery store may not be the fanciest or most hightech but its my top choice for a local shopping experience the staff is familiar and friendly and the selection of meat and produce is reliable plus the prices on soda are consistently low i take issue with people who call it the ghetto grocery – its safe affordable and has a welcoming atmosphere id love to see them take advantage of their quirky frontage by adding some outdoor tables and chairs for customers to enjoy,this is probably your mothers and fathers grocery store in other words if you want lots of flash and sizzle and the sounds of the rainforest echoing over your produce as the fake spritzer goes off this is not your scene this is my neighborhood grocery store and i like it because its walkable and bikeable the entire staff have watched my kid grow from the time she was a baby they know her name they know mine whens the last time you could say that about your local grocery meats are very good produce serviceable and soda is often on sale at ridiculously low prices i get annoyed at people who refer to it as the ghetto grocery which implies it is overpriced and perhaps doesnt have the class of people youd like to hang with this store is as safe as any other store and the people care i would like to see them utilize their wacky frontage for some tables and chairs so people can sit down eat and socialize
2,for a nofrills neighborhood grocery store this place cant be beat the staff is friendly and familiar and the meat and produce are consistently good the prices,this is probably your mothers and fathers grocery store in other words if you want lots of flash and sizzle and the sounds of the rainforest echoing over your produce as the fake spritzer goes off this is not your scene this is my neighborhood grocery store and i like it because its walkable and bikeable the entire staff have watched my kid grow from the time she was a baby they know her name they know mine whens the last time you could say that about your local grocery meats are very good produce serviceable and soda is often on sale at ridiculously low prices i get annoyed at people who refer to it as the ghetto grocery which implies it is overpriced and perhaps doesnt have the class of people youd like to hang with this store is as safe as any other store and the people care i would like to see them utilize their wacky frontage for some tables and chairs so people can sit down eat and socialize
2,today i had lunch at a restaurant with a colleague while the food was good the service was subpar the cashier seemed annoyed with us for ordering and she even took an imprint of my debit card i found this strange and id rather not have my card number printed on a receipt despite this the food was enjoyable and i like the variety of sauces they offer,i went there for lunch with a coworker today i would give the food 4 stars but the service brought it down to 3 the cashier taking the orders looked like we were bothering her by being there i handed over my debit card she ran it through and the receipt printed what struck me as odd is that she took an imprint of my card i questioned her and she informed me corporate is making us do this theres been a lot of fraud personally i would rather not have my card number printed on a piece of paper and changing who knows how many hands thats just me if i go back ill pay with cashnni had the bbq chicken and shrimp combo plate the food is good and i like their selection of sauces teriyaki katsu soy tartar mustard and sriracha to kick up the flavor
