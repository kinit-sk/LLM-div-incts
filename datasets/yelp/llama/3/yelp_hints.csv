our second visit to the smaller theatre the actors cafe  we saw the mousetrap last year and biloxi blues tonight  although we had seen the mousetrap before in london its been almost 40 years and it was time for a review  enjoyed the production in 2013  tonight neither of us had ever seen a production of neil simons autobigraphical second part of the three part triology bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound  the cast was delightful and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had just recently finished high school sorry but it showed and they are gaining valuable experience  the lead actor who played eugene who also narrated directly to the audience was delightful and quite a talent as well as the actor who played the sergeant although it was scary to be this close to him in this small space  the theatre is very small seating maybe 80 people at best and seating is flexible or festival seating as i like to call it but i ordered the tickets online 600 fee and printed out my actual tickets with bar codes on them to present at the door  however the doorman asked if i had stopped at the box office on the way in and when i told him no he asked for our names so he could tell them  unclear that we were expected to report to the box office since it appeared that the tickets printed were actual replicas of tickets with bar codes  it was not clearly explained on the web site that we were expected to report to the box office and we were not clear on the festival seating either or we would have arrived earlier so we didnt have to get stuck on the front row with our knees touching the edge of the stage  but the shows have been delightful so one star off for getting the website together and see you again next summer,3

as an aficionado of spanish cuisine i came in hoping to be at the least semiblown but resulted in a half satisfied appetite  the biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of tapas at least a dozen in each category seafood meat vegetablescheese  i always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these exotic ingredientsnnin my humble book i tend to base my spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious paella  for me this is a deal breaker  the pricing was fair and reasonable but the quality fell quite short the classic valencia was simply too watery history tells me it should be fluffier creamier and rich in flavor on the other hand the arros negre was more pleasing and entertaining if you never had squid ink in the paella form it is a safe try  the only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips teeth and tonguennthe list of tapas we tried included n the best and recommendednn the spanish potato pie was not as soft and fluffy as i imagined parts of it were choppy mediocre tastenn mushrooms with garlic and sherry very average nothing too special herenn rabbit stew with bread sauce for the first time trying this it was actually pretty good tasted like chicken  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stewnn braised oxtail in paprika sauce pleasantly pulled off the bone goodnn lamb chops thought it was somewhat dry thus not as juicy as i had hoped for  2 or 3 pieces i believenn calamari rings the batter was light and cooked perfectly accompanied by three different sauces that i cannot recall the names to but nonetheless tastynn snails average nothing to spectacularnnthe pitcher of sangria was too small for my usual liking it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine tastennwhat i liked the most was the atmospherelive music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the spanishesque decor to bring everything togethernnsince i was here for my birthday they did bring out a complimentary flan that i thought tasted a little eggy the cool part was partaking in a spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth n noverall the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the tapas with some exceptions thus i would only return for the squid ink paella rabbit stew and braised oxtail,2
after eagerly anticipating the opening of noodles  co i was thrilled to finally try it out with a friend we arrived just after 1230 pm and the line was nearly out the door which wasnt surprising given that it was a new restaurant however after enjoying my meal and overhearing the comments of the diners around me i can see this place having a steady 20person line from 1130 am to 130 pm the interior is smartly designed open and bright and the staff was incredibly friendly and seemed to be in a great mood eager to share their positivity with customers i opted for the pick3 deal which includes a small noodle bowl a choice of protein and soup or salad for 799 i chose the indonesian noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce which was really awesome and perfectly spicy packed with fresh vegetables i added beef and the tomato basil soup which was my favorite part of the meal by the time i added a drink my bill came to just under 10 im excited to return and try some of their other options such as the meat,3

a costly mistake for mexican food lovers,0
best food i ate during my 5 day stay in vegas by far,4
what an absolutely lovely spot for breakfast al fresco the ambience itself would have gotten five stars however our service was incredibly slow  we were a table of two adults and four children  all ordering from the adult menu  our waitress was quick to take our order but the food took exceptionally long and we had to ask twice for something that had been forgotten  after the meal we waited a bit to get our check but sent her back immediately with a credit card  after about five minutes we were told they were experiencing computer issues so it would be another moment or two  had she been up front about the delay wed have been more understanding but having to track her down on more than one occasion was a little bit of an annoyance  id like to go back sans kids to try out both the lunch and dinner restaurants  i love that everything was separate and we enjoyed watching both a morning wedding and the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate  such a quaint spot and didnt feel at all like we were in the middle of the desert,2

i called noble cleaners may i mention two local brothers who bust their hump as owners and employees after i was treated terribly by carpet green clean  i learned the carpet industry has a bait and switch tactic basically i wanted my entire house done the carpet tile and sofa just get it done in one big swoop the other company showed up and doubled their original price after haggling it went down a few hundred but i was so turned off i called noble cleaners while the guy was in my living room n  originally noble was my second lowest on the price check but after getting a proposed bill of 1k noble became seriously cheap the brothers came out the next day and on time they looked professional and had great equipment see the day before a single guy arrived in a beat up van with one machine for the entire project same machine for my micro fiber couch and carpet and said it would take the same amount of time that these two men would take i was getting had prob cause im a girln   noble did amazing work for a great price they kept with the price they quoted over the phone answered all my questions let me stand over their shoulders as i watched all the gross filth go through the nozzle also i didnt feel weird having these strange men in my house they are the sweetest thing ever in fact when i was making my first round of calls they said if i had any questions even if i dont choose them call back to be sure im not getting swindled n   they accept credit cards for no extra charge just fyi also i just felt good helping a local mom and pop company whose work you know will rock because the two own the company i recommend this company with my whole heart and will use them again save yourself the time patience and energy just give them a call,4

im bewildered by the positive reviews for this eatery ive been there three times now and while the ambiance and decor are nice the food has been subpar the chicken chimichanga and veggie burrito i ordered were only lukewarm and the flavors were uninspired the rice and beans were particularly bland and i prefer authentic mexican cuisine not something that tastes like taco bell in fact id give taco bell 3 stars because its fast food and i know what to expect unfortunately this restaurant didnt meet my expectations and we even had to buy our own chips and salsa which is typically complimentary at mexican restaurants,1
noodles co had a grand opening and i was eager to taste their food i went there with a friend and we arrived at 1230 pm the line was out the door but it was a new restaurant so it was expected the atmosphere was open and bright and the staff was friendly and enthusiastic i ordered the indonesian noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce and added beef and it was perfect the tomato basil soup was my favorite and my total bill was under 10 im looking forward to trying their other options like the meatball sub,3
my wife and i dropped by villa dolce for a drink and were surprised to learn that they had been in business for seven years we initially sat at the cozy bar but the bright string lights made it difficult to see so we moved to seats by the window when we mentioned our concern to the bartender she didnt seem to understand our feedback despite this we enjoyed our drinks including a negroni the size of a small pool and a mixed berry gin lemonade with fresh blueberries and raspberries the pizzas,2
i visited the former olympic gyros location on 24th street for lunch today and had a mixed experience while the restaurant itself is small the 499 gyro i ordered was flavorful and had plenty of meat however i was surprised that they were unable to provide a cup of water to accompany my meal which was a bit of a letdown,1
as a passionate devotee of spanish cuisine i had high hopes for a satisfying dining experience but unfortunately my expectations were only partially met the restaurants extensive selection of tapas with at least a dozen options in each category was undoubtedly its strongest selling point however the quality of the dishes fell short of my expectations with the exception of the arros negre which was flavorful and entertaining the paella in particular was a disappointment lacking the richness and creaminess that i had anticipated the pricing was reasonable but the overall experience was merely average with some dishes impressing me more than others,2
i continue to eat here when im visiting campus and i dont know why the sushi is okay at best and overpriced the atmosphere is tacky,1

during our second visit to the smaller theatre we had the opportunity to enjoy two productions the mousetrap and biloxi blues while we had previously seen the mousetrap in london almost 40 years ago it was due for a review we found the production in 2013 to be enjoyable and as for biloxi blues neither of us had seen a production of neil simons autobiographical second part of the threepart trilogy which is bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound the cast delivered a delightful performance and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had recently finished high school although they are gaining valuable experience their inexperience showed,3
the breakfast we were served was unexpectedly delicious with biscuits that possibly rank among the best ive ever had my friends blueberry pancakes were fresh and bursting with flavor while my omelette made with country sausage was fluffy and yellow just as eggs should be despite some concerns about the wait time based on other yelp reviews we were able to enjoy our meal within 15 minutes of arriving if youre looking for a lovely breakfast spot in south mountain that feels like a charming farm in the midwest this is a great option for a weekend morning with loved ones,4
the servers overthetop italian accent the mediocre free house wine the unimpressive minestrone soup the garlic bread that was heavy on butter and light on garlic and the unremarkable fettuccini alfredo all fell short of my expectations despite the generous portion size,0

when my friend and i came in on a monday night we were worried that the restaurant was empty but our waiter earnest was super friendly and didnt hover over us or try to make small talk which was great the food was also amazing with the crab rangoon and kalbi being highlights the menu was a bit confusing but the quality of the food made up for it i definitely recommend this place especially during the week when they could use more business,3

i would not reccommend this dealership to anyone i purchased a brand new 2011 vw jetta last november from findlay vw 2 weeks after i purchased the car the tire blew out and no one could figure out what the cause was at first they were going to make me pay full prices for the tire even though i only had the car barely 2 weeks after arguing with them and going back and forth they finally split the cost with me the sales person i purchased it from during the whole ordeal would not call me back after leaving several messages now i have something else wrong with it i will never take my car back there for anything i go to desert where they have much better customer service the customer service at findlay volkswagen is horrible after they got their money and my trade in they didnt care about me afterwards i would never recommend them to anyone or go back to them for anything maybe theres a reason why my car was the last 2011 on the lot and they just wanted to get rid of it,0

my spouse and i recently visited villa dolce for a beverage and we were unaware that the establishment had been open for seven years we initially sat at the bar but the bright string lights made it difficult to see so we moved to seats by the window although we mentioned our concern to the bartender she didnt seem to comprehend our feedback despite this we enjoyed our drinks including a negroni the size of a small pool and a mixed berry gin lemonade with fresh blueberries and raspberries the pizzas salads and desserts being served looked delicious making us wonder why we hadnt tried making them at home,2
this spot is handsdown one of the top places to catch a concert in vegas the cosmo pool is a close second but this place takes the cake my husband and i practically live at the beach during the summer because they offer an amazing variety of concerts in a laidback and fun atmosphere its the perfect escape from the chaos of the strip weve seen some amazing performances from ziggy marley to one republic just be prepared for expensive drinks and long bar lines so its a good idea to grab some drinks beforehand,3
i went in tuesday for a quick drink with a friend and was thoroughly disappointed  i ordered a long island ice tea which is a pretty standard drink but the two young ladies working had to look it up online okay fine but they were missing a few key ingredients  but served it anyway and it was awful instead of serving a subpar drink offer something else service was slow too when we were ready to pay and leave the waitress was off sitting and talking with some friends,1
