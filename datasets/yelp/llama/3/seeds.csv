cox is atrociousnnbefore moving to phoenix we had directv because of the direction our apartment faces the dish could not be installed so we went with cox once our introductory period was up our service became really crappy the hd channels that we pay extra for are fuzzy  jumpy a technician came out a couple of weeks ago and made some repairs and adjustments everything was working fine for about a week and slowly the fuzziness  jumpiness returned in first the hd channels now all the channels are crappy i just finished chatting online with a rep i cant bare to talk to someone on the phone i would curse someone out another technician is coming back on friday this time i requested they replace the digital box oh and we cant access ondemand programming either nnwe havent had any problem with our internet thats why they get 1 star once our contract is up which i hope is soon we are cancelling,0
i was enjoying my pedicure until the guy starting cutting one of my cuticles and i said ow that hurts and he kept pulling on it  it bled hurt like hell and he murmured a quick apology and moved onto the next nail  the polish job looked fine but it took several weeks for my little toe to healno way am i going back,0
really one of the worst mexican food restaurants in the area and while the decor is nice and this would be a good place to take the kids the food is just terrible and the place is expensive  tough to find good mexican food in phoenix but this just isnt it,0
very disappointing  the consigned furniture was interesting and wellpriced but it comprised about 10 of the inventory which is unusual in a consignment store  the other furniture can be found at any of the furniture stores on spring mountain but it is overpriced here  i wont be back,0
i would not reccommend this dealership to anyone i purchased a brand new 2011 vw jetta last november from findlay vw 2 weeks after i purchased the car the tire blew out and no one could figure out what the cause was at first they were going to make me pay full prices for the tire even though i only had the car barely 2 weeks after arguing with them and going back and forth they finally split the cost with me the sales person i purchased it from during the whole ordeal would not call me back after leaving several messages now i have something else wrong with it i will never take my car back there for anything i go to desert where they have much better customer service the customer service at findlay volkswagen is horrible after they got their money and my trade in they didnt care about me afterwards i would never recommend them to anyone or go back to them for anything maybe theres a reason why my car was the last 2011 on the lot and they just wanted to get rid of it,0
the fake italian drawl from the server the crappy free house wine the mushy lukewarm minestrone soup nnthe garlic bread that was more buttered than garlicnnthe fettuccini alfredo was creamy but bland the tastiest thing was the char grilled chicken breast slices it was a decent amountnnhowever for 2795 im underwhelmed lol oh well,0
24th street here lives in the former home of olympic gyros  i stopped by today for lunch  it went like thisnnthe badnnthis tiny restaurant cant put together a cup of water to go with your meal     onnthe goodnntheir 499 gyro tastes good  has lots of meat,1
i continue to eat here when im visiting campus and i dont know why the sushi is okay at best and overpriced the atmosphere is tacky,1
not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars  i gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere  i live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular mexican place was closed salsa cabana nni had the chicken chimi with rice and beans it was ok could have been better temp of food was warm not hot  wife had the veggie burrito  this was a bean burro with lettuce  the rice and beans were bland  this place is not for me i like my mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell wait i would have gave taco bell 3 stars because its fast food mexican and i know what to expect there  nnwe had to buy chips and salsa really  every mexican food restaurant gives you this for me this is why i go to get mexican food,1
i started going to arrichion last fall before their livingsocialgroupon deals started going out and i loved it the heat the instructors the feeling of community  everything nnbut thendun dun dunthe dreaded crowds came arrichion puts out so many lsgroupon deals that the studio has gone from popular and well attended to absolutelyjampackedunpleasant every class ive gone to since the late fall has been totally packed ive waited outside for 30 minutes and gotten turned away because the class is full online sign ups would be very helpful at this gym also there is no instruction in the yoga room whatsoever the workouts definitely left me sweaty and sore but the monthly fees are way too expensive for the experience nnsorry  i was a lover but have moved on,1
the food is alright  its kind of overpriced and the quality sucks  ive been here once before i dont know why i came back  yes i do  a friend mozied on in and the group just followedni got the breakfast burritos  the portion size was so tiny a major disappointment on my end  beans sucked pinto beans always sucks  i forgot the other side that came with it i thnk it was friesi love fries except sweet potato  those should be banned from restaurants unless theyre not in the form of fries,1
i went in tuesday for a quick drink with a friend and was thoroughly disappointed  i ordered a long island ice tea which is a pretty standard drink but the two young ladies working had to look it up online okay fine but they were missing a few key ingredients  but served it anyway and it was awful instead of serving a subpar drink offer something else service was slow too when we were ready to pay and leave the waitress was off sitting and talking with some friends,1
dont expect it to be the exactly the same as aristocrat restaurant in manila all they have are grilled items some appetizers and noodles they dont have the full blown restaurant i was so excited to try the chicken bbq it wasnt exactly the same but the java rice was pretty close i would still come back and hopefully things get tastier as time goes by as they just opened and still seemed disorganized it is right next to lbc and jolibee i suggest you stop by i think their pricing is very affordable good value for what you are getting,2
as an aficionado of spanish cuisine i came in hoping to be at the least semiblown but resulted in a half satisfied appetite  the biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of tapas at least a dozen in each category seafood meat vegetablescheese  i always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these exotic ingredientsnnin my humble book i tend to base my spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious paella  for me this is a deal breaker  the pricing was fair and reasonable but the quality fell quite short the classic valencia was simply too watery history tells me it should be fluffier creamier and rich in flavor on the other hand the arros negre was more pleasing and entertaining if you never had squid ink in the paella form it is a safe try  the only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips teeth and tonguennthe list of tapas we tried included n the best and recommendednn the spanish potato pie was not as soft and fluffy as i imagined parts of it were choppy mediocre tastenn mushrooms with garlic and sherry very average nothing too special herenn rabbit stew with bread sauce for the first time trying this it was actually pretty good tasted like chicken  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stewnn braised oxtail in paprika sauce pleasantly pulled off the bone goodnn lamb chops thought it was somewhat dry thus not as juicy as i had hoped for  2 or 3 pieces i believenn calamari rings the batter was light and cooked perfectly accompanied by three different sauces that i cannot recall the names to but nonetheless tastynn snails average nothing to spectacularnnthe pitcher of sangria was too small for my usual liking it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine tastennwhat i liked the most was the atmospherelive music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the spanishesque decor to bring everything togethernnsince i was here for my birthday they did bring out a complimentary flan that i thought tasted a little eggy the cool part was partaking in a spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth n noverall the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the tapas with some exceptions thus i would only return for the squid ink paella rabbit stew and braised oxtail,2
lingerie that i can order from my room at all hoursamazing so love jones is way overpriced but they have some very unique and erotic items that will make you drool as you walk by the window displays which changehourly i believe nim a total sucker for window displays and on this particular trip i was struck by the gorgeous beach bunny bathing suit display nhttpswwwbeachbunnyswimwearcomindexcfmnthese bathing suits are as close as you can get to wearing lingerie during the dayand they are fabulous because love jones carries them makes them aok in my booknthe gold star pasties were a huge hit i bought them for my girlfriends bday to go under her hot pink dress and lets just say we saw a lot of those pasties all nightnif you have won in the casino or have a boy who has moneygo here and have a blast trying onbuying lingerie you can really only find in places like las vegas,2
91013 my wife and i stopped in at villa dolce for a drink  we had no idea they had been in business for 7 years  we initially sat at their cozy bar but had to switch to their window seats because they had these really bright string lights blinding us  we mentioned it to the bartender but she didnt seem to understand the constructive criticism  that said we enjoyed our drinks  my wife had a negroni the size of a small pool  i had a mixed berry gin lemonade fresh blueberries  raspberries  why havent i been making these at home  nnthe pizzas salads and desserts being served looked delicious,2
what an absolutely lovely spot for breakfast al fresco the ambience itself would have gotten five stars however our service was incredibly slow  we were a table of two adults and four children  all ordering from the adult menu  our waitress was quick to take our order but the food took exceptionally long and we had to ask twice for something that had been forgotten  after the meal we waited a bit to get our check but sent her back immediately with a credit card  after about five minutes we were told they were experiencing computer issues so it would be another moment or two  had she been up front about the delay wed have been more understanding but having to track her down on more than one occasion was a little bit of an annoyance  id like to go back sans kids to try out both the lunch and dinner restaurants  i love that everything was separate and we enjoyed watching both a morning wedding and the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate  such a quaint spot and didnt feel at all like we were in the middle of the desert,2
if colourful zany standoutfromthecrowd shoes are your thing then theres no better place to go than helen bateman the shoes here are all individual and unique so you definitely wont find them anywhere else in the world and they certainly arent copies of other brands like many shoe companies these bad boys march to the beat of their own drumnni love heels but im a little bit more conservative with shoes going mainly for single colours and printed pumps are usually as adventurous as i go so helen bateman shoes really are for those who like to make a statement with their shoesnnthey are all made with excellent quality materials and when i had a browse round the shop on william street i could see how good quality the shoes were they have everything from boots pumps and trainers to heels and wedges  all of which make a statementnnif youre looking for something a little bit different then give this place a try,2
randomly came upon this place with some friends and we totally fell in love  great energy inside and the food rocks  we shared 3 tapas dishes and had cocktails and it was deliciouswe were just looking for a snack  loved having the basque influence there with the kalimotxo 18 was tough to shell out there for this but i hadnt had one in forever so i splurgedand it was exactly as i had hoped for  really cool restaurant am looking forward to going backi hope it sticks around because not many in this area have held up,3
the array of seafood they offer here for the price is truly impressive you can sample sushi and sashimi to mussels and crab legs they always feature salmon and sometimes even have crawfish theres a whole lot to pick from and usually the price is around 20 per person its hard to beat the value you get for your hardearned seafoodsnarfin dollar herenna couple of things i noticed in the few times ive done the buffet thing here if you arrive late the pickins will be slimmer there will be some items that you know have sat in the chafing dish that arent as palatablelooking as they were when first deployed you have to act fast when the batches of crab legs are put out since everyone and their mom seems to belly up for another round of these pronto i also steer clear of a lot of the sushi past 9 pm it always looks a little driedout and curious to me not something im willing to take too much of a chance onnnhowever i feel the dining experience here is pleasant the staff are friendly and helpful and there is a ton of good seafood to keep you satisfied there are even things that im a little unsure of how to eat like sea snails or something i couldnt quite recognize this place is densely frequented by the east valley asian community which to me says this is the place to find reasonablypriced good seafood beware thoughthe competition is fierce for those fresh batches of crab legs you may have to use your crab cracker to defend your rightlydeserved hardfoughtandwon portion,3
hands down this is one of the best spot for concerts in vegas maybe only the cosmo pool tops nnmy husband and i practically live at the beach during the summer  they offer a great variety concerts in a completely laid back and fun atmosphereit really lets you escape the hustle and bustle of the strip weve seen everything from ziggy marley to one republic   nnmy only caution is the drinks are quite expensive and the bar lines are insane  definitely grab some drinks beforehand,3
when my friend and i came in on a monday night we were really worried this place was empty thats not a good sign then as we sat down i looked at reviews on here and i was doubly worried nnyou guys this place is awesome our waiter earnest was a super nice guy and even though the restaurant was empty he didnt hover over us or try to make a lot of small talk with us i realize wait staff gets bored on slow nights but i just dont like making conversation with people i dont know when im sitting there starving to death so in my mind he was freakin awesomenni could see how the two menu thing could be confusing but honestly you get like 10 menus at chilis so who cares its a second menu with like 5 things on it for an appetizer i got crab rangoon and they did it like chips and dip which in retrospect i have to wonder why i havent been eating crab rangoon like this my whole life nnthe food was excellent i got kalbi and my friend got bulgogi the menu said the kalbi was made la style so i didnt start throwing chairs in a rage when it wasnt made just like korean kalbi nni really recommend you give this place a shot especially during the week because it looks like they need it there the most the reason i gave this place 4 stars was because for my kalbi they gave me scissors and tongs to cut it off the bone and although my motor skills are sometimes questionable im pretty sure i could correctly operate a sharp knife to help me with the task of cutting the meat off the bone it just got a little awkward after a bit was all of course now as i write this i realize i could have just asked for a knife but i feel like that would have been too easy,3
our second visit to the smaller theatre the actors cafe  we saw the mousetrap last year and biloxi blues tonight  although we had seen the mousetrap before in london its been almost 40 years and it was time for a review  enjoyed the production in 2013  tonight neither of us had ever seen a production of neil simons autobigraphical second part of the three part triology bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound  the cast was delightful and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had just recently finished high school sorry but it showed and they are gaining valuable experience  the lead actor who played eugene who also narrated directly to the audience was delightful and quite a talent as well as the actor who played the sergeant although it was scary to be this close to him in this small space  the theatre is very small seating maybe 80 people at best and seating is flexible or festival seating as i like to call it but i ordered the tickets online 600 fee and printed out my actual tickets with bar codes on them to present at the door  however the doorman asked if i had stopped at the box office on the way in and when i told him no he asked for our names so he could tell them  unclear that we were expected to report to the box office since it appeared that the tickets printed were actual replicas of tickets with bar codes  it was not clearly explained on the web site that we were expected to report to the box office and we were not clear on the festival seating either or we would have arrived earlier so we didnt have to get stuck on the front row with our knees touching the edge of the stage  but the shows have been delightful so one star off for getting the website together and see you again next summer,3
after eagerly awaiting the opening of noodles  co i was very excited to try it a friend and i arrived just after 1230 and the line was nearly out the door this wasnt surprising seeing it was a new restaurant however after finishing my meal and over hearing the comments of the diners around me i can see this place having a steady 20 person line from 1130  130 the interior is smartly designed open and bright i also couldnt get over how great the staff was everyone was very friendly and seemed like they legitimately were in a good mood and wanted to share that with you nni did the pick 3 deal where you get a small noodle bowl a choice of protein and soup or salad for 799 i ordered the indonesian noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce really awesome perfectly make your nose run spicy and packed with fresh vegetables i added beef and the tomato basil soup my favorite part of the meal by the time i added a drink my bill came to just under 10 i cant wait to come back and try some of their other options i saw a meatball sub that looked pretty excellent,3
i love the haircut i got at this salon calvin did a fantastic job with my hair as i have been unhappy with the way it was growing after chemo calvin took the time to discuss what i wanted without rushing and seem to know exactly what i wanted would recommend highly and will be going back in 46 wks to have trim,4
you go into four peaks and everybody there is your friend on a busy friday night this is the weekend warmup to beat them all its loud its packed its fun nnill usually mix up brews but i always come back to my old friend kilt lifter appropriately named i would say  goes great with just about anything but i enjoy the spinach artichoke dip shrimp  goat cheese bruschetta and their calamari is the best ive tried anywhere definitely worth stopping in,4
the breakfast they served us hit the spot like we hadnt expected it is possible that their biscuits are the best ive ever had or can ever hope to have my friend had blueberry pancakes that were so fresh the berries were falling out i had an omelette made with country sausage the omelette was very big and fluffy and yellow just the way eggs should be i was afraid of having to wait long because of the other yelp reviews but we were eating less than 15 minutes after we arrived if youre in south mountain and want to eat breakfast for around 10person in a place which feels like it could be on a beautiful little farm in the midwest come here its very lovely and a great way to start the morning on your weekends off from work with those you love,4
we love dr pendleton i switched to her office when my daughter was younger and we were unhappy with healing hearts peds we have been a patient for over 5 years now always easy to get an appointment when needed and danielle  dr pendleton are wonderful with my kids,4
best food i ate during my 5 day stay in vegas by far,4
i called noble cleaners may i mention two local brothers who bust their hump as owners and employees after i was treated terribly by carpet green clean  i learned the carpet industry has a bait and switch tactic basically i wanted my entire house done the carpet tile and sofa just get it done in one big swoop the other company showed up and doubled their original price after haggling it went down a few hundred but i was so turned off i called noble cleaners while the guy was in my living room n  originally noble was my second lowest on the price check but after getting a proposed bill of 1k noble became seriously cheap the brothers came out the next day and on time they looked professional and had great equipment see the day before a single guy arrived in a beat up van with one machine for the entire project same machine for my micro fiber couch and carpet and said it would take the same amount of time that these two men would take i was getting had prob cause im a girln   noble did amazing work for a great price they kept with the price they quoted over the phone answered all my questions let me stand over their shoulders as i watched all the gross filth go through the nozzle also i didnt feel weird having these strange men in my house they are the sweetest thing ever in fact when i was making my first round of calls they said if i had any questions even if i dont choose them call back to be sure im not getting swindled n   they accept credit cards for no extra charge just fyi also i just felt good helping a local mom and pop company whose work you know will rock because the two own the company i recommend this company with my whole heart and will use them again save yourself the time patience and energy just give them a call,4
