2,as a enthusiast of spanish cuisine i had high hopes for my dining experience but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations the restaurants extensive selection of tapas was a major draw for me but the quality of the dishes was inconsistent while the arros negre was a pleasant surprise the paella was disappointing with a watery texture and lacking the rich creamy flavor i was expecting the spanish potato pie was also underwhelming with parts of it being choppy and mediocre in taste however the braised oxtail in paprika sauce was a highlight with tender meat that easily pulled off the bone the lamb chops were a letdown as they were somewhat dry and not as juicy as i had hoped the calamari rings were cooked to perfection but the batter was light and the accompanying sauces were forgettable the pitcher of sangria was too small and lacked the rich wineinfused flavor i was expecting the atmosphere was lively with live music and richly detailed spanishinspired decor but overall the experience was just average with some dishes standing out as exceptions,as an aficionado of spanish cuisine i came in hoping to be at the least semiblown but resulted in a half satisfied appetite  the biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of tapas at least a dozen in each category seafood meat vegetablescheese  i always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these exotic ingredientsnnin my humble book i tend to base my spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious paella  for me this is a deal breaker  the pricing was fair and reasonable but the quality fell quite short the classic valencia was simply too watery history tells me it should be fluffier creamier and rich in flavor on the other hand the arros negre was more pleasing and entertaining if you never had squid ink in the paella form it is a safe try  the only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips teeth and tonguennthe list of tapas we tried included n the best and recommendednn the spanish potato pie was not as soft and fluffy as i imagined parts of it were choppy mediocre tastenn mushrooms with garlic and sherry very average nothing too special herenn rabbit stew with bread sauce for the first time trying this it was actually pretty good tasted like chicken  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stewnn braised oxtail in paprika sauce pleasantly pulled off the bone goodnn lamb chops thought it was somewhat dry thus not as juicy as i had hoped for  2 or 3 pieces i believenn calamari rings the batter was light and cooked perfectly accompanied by three different sauces that i cannot recall the names to but nonetheless tastynn snails average nothing to spectacularnnthe pitcher of sangria was too small for my usual liking it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine tastennwhat i liked the most was the atmospherelive music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the spanishesque decor to bring everything togethernnsince i was here for my birthday they did bring out a complimentary flan that i thought tasted a little eggy the cool part was partaking in a spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth n noverall the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the tapas with some exceptions thus i would only return for the squid ink paella rabbit stew and braised oxtail

2,we had a lovely outdoor breakfast at a charming spot but our service was unfortunately slow despite our waitress being quick to take our order the food took a long time to arrive and we had to remind her twice about a forgotten item after the meal we waited briefly for our check but had to send it back immediately with a credit card we were told that the delay was due to computer issues which would have been understandable if our waitress had been upfront about it however having to track her down multiple times was frustrating despite this i would like to return to the restaurant without my children to try both the lunch and dinner menus as the ambiance was delightful and we enjoyed watching a morning wedding and farmers picking flowers while we ate the setting was quaint and didnt feel like we were in the middle of the desert,what an absolutely lovely spot for breakfast al fresco the ambience itself would have gotten five stars however our service was incredibly slow  we were a table of two adults and four children  all ordering from the adult menu  our waitress was quick to take our order but the food took exceptionally long and we had to ask twice for something that had been forgotten  after the meal we waited a bit to get our check but sent her back immediately with a credit card  after about five minutes we were told they were experiencing computer issues so it would be another moment or two  had she been up front about the delay wed have been more understanding but having to track her down on more than one occasion was a little bit of an annoyance  id like to go back sans kids to try out both the lunch and dinner restaurants  i love that everything was separate and we enjoyed watching both a morning wedding and the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate  such a quaint spot and didnt feel at all like we were in the middle of the desert

3,when my friend and i arrived on a monday night the restaurant was practically empty which made us apprehensive however our waiter earnest was very friendly and attentive despite the slow night he didnt hover over us or try to make small talk which we appreciated the menu was a bit confusing but we didnt mind because we received two menus with a variety of options i ordered crab rangoon which was served like chips and dip and it was delicious i also got kalbi which was made in a unique way but still very tasty my friend got bulgogi and we both agreed that the food was excellent the only reason i gave this place four stars instead of five was because they gave me scissors and tongs to cut my kalbi which was a bit awkward however i would still highly recommend this restaurant especially during the week when they seem to need more customers,when my friend and i came in on a monday night we were really worried this place was empty thats not a good sign then as we sat down i looked at reviews on here and i was doubly worried nnyou guys this place is awesome our waiter earnest was a super nice guy and even though the restaurant was empty he didnt hover over us or try to make a lot of small talk with us i realize wait staff gets bored on slow nights but i just dont like making conversation with people i dont know when im sitting there starving to death so in my mind he was freakin awesomenni could see how the two menu thing could be confusing but honestly you get like 10 menus at chilis so who cares its a second menu with like 5 things on it for an appetizer i got crab rangoon and they did it like chips and dip which in retrospect i have to wonder why i havent been eating crab rangoon like this my whole life nnthe food was excellent i got kalbi and my friend got bulgogi the menu said the kalbi was made la style so i didnt start throwing chairs in a rage when it wasnt made just like korean kalbi nni really recommend you give this place a shot especially during the week because it looks like they need it there the most the reason i gave this place 4 stars was because for my kalbi they gave me scissors and tongs to cut it off the bone and although my motor skills are sometimes questionable im pretty sure i could correctly operate a sharp knife to help me with the task of cutting the meat off the bone it just got a little awkward after a bit was all of course now as i write this i realize i could have just asked for a knife but i feel like that would have been too easy
