cox is atrociousnnbefore moving to phoenix we had directv because of the direction our apartment faces the dish could not be installed so we went with cox once our introductory period was up our service became really crappy the hd channels that we pay extra for are fuzzy  jumpy a technician came out a couple of weeks ago and made some repairs and adjustments everything was working fine for about a week and slowly the fuzziness  jumpiness returned in first the hd channels now all the channels are crappy i just finished chatting online with a rep i cant bare to talk to someone on the phone i would curse someone out another technician is coming back on friday this time i requested they replace the digital box oh and we cant access ondemand programming either nnwe havent had any problem with our internet thats why they get 1 star once our contract is up which i hope is soon we are cancelling,4
tuesday evening found me at a bar with a friend both of us looking forward to a relaxing drink,3
without a doubt this is one of the top spots for live music in vegas the cosmo pool is the only place that comes close to rivaling it my husband and i practically live at the beach during the summer because they offer an amazing variety of concerts in a super relaxed and fun atmosphere its the perfect escape from the chaos of the strip weve seen some incredible performances from ziggy marley to one republic just be prepared for pricey drinks and long bar lines so its a good idea to grab some drinks beforehand,1
a lessthansatisfying experience for fans of mexican food,4
during our second visit to the smaller theatre we had the pleasure of watching two productions the mousetrap and biloxi blues while we had previously seen the mousetrap in london almost 40 years ago it was time for a review we found the 2013 production to be enjoyable and as for biloxi blues neither of us had seen a production of neil simons autobiographical second part of the threepart trilogy which is bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound the cast delivered a delightful performance and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had recently finished high school although they are gaining valuable experience their inexperience showed,1
this restaurants menu deviates from the usual offerings at manilas finer dining establishments showcasing a range of grilled dishes appetizers and noodles their chicken bbq did not meet my expectations but their java rice was a nice surprise despite some initial confusion i would still recommend visiting this restaurant,2
dont anticipate a duplicate of aristocrat restaurants menu in manila because they have a smaller selection including grilled items appetizers and noodles their chicken bbq didnt meet my expectations but their java rice was a nice surprise despite this i would still recommend stopping by especially given their reasonable prices and proximity to lbc and jolibee,2

i was enjoying my pedicure until the guy starting cutting one of my cuticles and i said ow that hurts and he kept pulling on it  it bled hurt like hell and he murmured a quick apology and moved onto the next nail  the polish job looked fine but it took several weeks for my little toe to healno way am i going back,4
im perplexed by my consistent desire to eat at this restaurant whenever im visiting the campus despite the fact that the sushi is merely adequate and the prices are steep the atmosphere doesnt exactly scream upscale dining experience either,3
disappointing event with redundant elements,4
this restaurant may have a pleasant atmosphere perfect for family outings but its culinary offerings are subpar and its prices are steep if youre searching for delicious mexican food in phoenix this place is not a recommended choice despite its seemingly inviting ambiance,4

underwhelming encounter with excessive repetition,4
dont expect a carbon copy of aristocrat restaurants menu in manila as they have a more limited selection including grilled items appetizers and noodles while their chicken bbq didnt meet my expectations their java rice was a pleasant surprise id still suggest stopping by especially given their affordable prices and proximity to lbc and jolibee,2
the food here is just okay and the prices are a bit steep ive been here once before and im not sure why i came back maybe it was because a friend suggested it i ordered the breakfast burritos which were small and not that great the beans were a letdown especially the pinto beans i cant remember what the other side dish was but i think it was fries i enjoy fries but sweet potato fries are not my favorite they should only be served in restaurants if theyre not in the form of fries,3
the initial meal of the day we were provided was a happy surprise thanks to biscuits that turned out to be unexpectedly delectable much to the pleasure of my companions and me,0
the consigned furniture was interesting and wellpriced but it made up an unusually large portion of the inventory with about 10 of the items being consigned the rest of the furniture can be found at other stores on spring mountain but its overpriced at this store i wont be returning due to the lack of variety in,4
not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars  i gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere  i live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular mexican place was closed salsa cabana nni had the chicken chimi with rice and beans it was ok could have been better temp of food was warm not hot  wife had the veggie burrito  this was a bean burro with lettuce  the rice and beans were bland  this place is not for me i like my mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell wait i would have gave taco bell 3 stars because its fast food mexican and i know what to expect there  nnwe had to buy chips and salsa really  every mexican food restaurant gives you this for me this is why i go to get mexican food,3
while indulging in the gastronomic offerings of las vegas during my fiveday sojourn i encountered a singular dining experience that outshone all others leaving an indelible mark on my palate,0
underwhelming encounter with too much repetition,4
the servers fake italian accent the lowquality free house wine the lukewarm and unappetizing minestrone soup the garlic bread that was overly buttered and lacking in garlic flavor and the uninspired fettuccini alfredo all contributed to a lessthansatisfying dining experience for 2795 i expected more than just a decent amount of chargrilled chicken breast slices,4
after eagerly awaiting the opening of noodles  co i was very excited to try it a friend and i arrived just after 1230 and the line was nearly out the door this wasnt surprising seeing it was a new restaurant however after finishing my meal and over hearing the comments of the diners around me i can see this place having a steady 20 person line from 1130  130 the interior is smartly designed open and bright i also couldnt get over how great the staff was everyone was very friendly and seemed like they legitimately were in a good mood and wanted to share that with you nni did the pick 3 deal where you get a small noodle bowl a choice of protein and soup or salad for 799 i ordered the indonesian noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce really awesome perfectly make your nose run spicy and packed with fresh vegetables i added beef and the tomato basil soup my favorite part of the meal by the time i added a drink my bill came to just under 10 i cant wait to come back and try some of their other options i saw a meatball sub that looked pretty excellent,1

im a lingerie enthusiast and always on the lookout for unique and alluring pieces that are available around the clock love jones may have a hefty price tag but their selection is truly impressive and their window displays are absolutely stunning changing every hour im particularly fond of their beach bunny bathing suits which are essentially lingerie for daytime wear and a musthave for anyone looking to make a statement the gold star pasties were a huge hit at my girlfriends birthday party and we saw many of them throughout the,2
underwhelming encounter with excessive duplication,4
as an aficionado of lingerie im always searching for unique and highquality items love jones may be a bit expensive but their selection is truly exceptional and their window displays are absolutely stunning changing hourly their beach bunny bathing suits are a personal favorite of mine as theyre essentially lingerie for the daytime and i can attest that the gold star pasties were a huge hit with my significant other,2
the menu at this restaurant differs from the typical fare found at upscale manila eateries with a focus on grilled options appetizers and noodles although their chicken bbq was not up to par their java rice was a welcome surprise despite some initial disorganization i would still suggest giving this restaurant a try,2
best food i ate during my 5 day stay in vegas by far,0
im baffled by my consistent craving for this restaurants food whenever im on campus despite the fact that the sushi is only decent and the prices are rather steep the surroundings dont exactly create a sophisticated dining ambiance,3
fans of flavorful tacos and burritos could be in for a costly surprise,4
the breakfast they served us hit the spot like we hadnt expected it is possible that their biscuits are the best ive ever had or can ever hope to have my friend had blueberry pancakes that were so fresh the berries were falling out i had an omelette made with country sausage the omelette was very big and fluffy and yellow just the way eggs should be i was afraid of having to wait long because of the other yelp reviews but we were eating less than 15 minutes after we arrived if youre in south mountain and want to eat breakfast for around 10person in a place which feels like it could be on a beautiful little farm in the midwest come here its very lovely and a great way to start the morning on your weekends off from work with those you love,0
when my friend and i came in on a monday night we were really worried this place was empty thats not a good sign then as we sat down i looked at reviews on here and i was doubly worried nnyou guys this place is awesome our waiter earnest was a super nice guy and even though the restaurant was empty he didnt hover over us or try to make a lot of small talk with us i realize wait staff gets bored on slow nights but i just dont like making conversation with people i dont know when im sitting there starving to death so in my mind he was freakin awesomenni could see how the two menu thing could be confusing but honestly you get like 10 menus at chilis so who cares its a second menu with like 5 things on it for an appetizer i got crab rangoon and they did it like chips and dip which in retrospect i have to wonder why i havent been eating crab rangoon like this my whole life nnthe food was excellent i got kalbi and my friend got bulgogi the menu said the kalbi was made la style so i didnt start throwing chairs in a rage when it wasnt made just like korean kalbi nni really recommend you give this place a shot especially during the week because it looks like they need it there the most the reason i gave this place 4 stars was because for my kalbi they gave me scissors and tongs to cut it off the bone and although my motor skills are sometimes questionable im pretty sure i could correctly operate a sharp knife to help me with the task of cutting the meat off the bone it just got a little awkward after a bit was all of course now as i write this i realize i could have just asked for a knife but i feel like that would have been too easy,1
the food here is nothing special and the expenses are a bit high,3
i had a fantastic experience at arrichion during the fall before they started offering livingsocialgroupon deals the heat instructors and sense of community were all topnotch however once the crowds arrived the experience significantly deteriorated arrichion has since become overcrowded and ive had to wait outside for 30 minutes or get turned away from classes online signups would be a valuable solution and the lack of instruction in the yoga room is disappointing despite the physically demanding workouts unfortunately the monthly fees have become too expensive for the value provided,3
although our service was slow the charming atmosphere of this outdoor breakfast spot still deserves a fivestar rating we were a group of two adults and four children all ordering from the adult menu but our waitress took her time delivering our food and we had to remind her twice about a forgotten item after the meal we waited patiently for our check but it took a while to arrive and when it did we were told that the restaurant was experiencing computer issues which caused another delay despite the inconvenience i would still like to return to this quaint spot without the kids to try out their lunch and dinner options as everything was served separately and we enjoyed watching a morning wedding and the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate,2
im absolutely thrilled with the haircut i received at this salon calvin did an amazing job especially considering ive been unhappy with my hair growth after chemotherapy he took the time to listen to my concerns and seemed to understand exactly what i wanted i highly recommend him and will definitely be going back in 46 weeks for a trim,0
really one of the worst mexican food restaurants in the area and while the decor is nice and this would be a good place to take the kids the food is just terrible and the place is expensive  tough to find good mexican food in phoenix but this just isnt it,4
although las vegas provided a variety of delicious dining options during my fiveday stay one specific meal truly stood out as the most exceptional culinary experience i had,0
this picturesque outdoor breakfast spot has a lovely ambiance that would have earned five stars but our service was regrettably slow our party of two adults and four children ordered from the adult menu but our waitress took her time taking our order and we had to ask twice for a forgotten item after our meal we waited for our check but it took a bit longer than expected and when we finally received it we were told that the restaurant was experiencing computer,2
while sin city offered plenty of tasty options during my fiveday visit one particular meal blew me away as the absolute best food i enjoyed,0
as an aficionado of spanish cuisine i came in hoping to be at the least semiblown but resulted in a half satisfied appetite  the biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of tapas at least a dozen in each category seafood meat vegetablescheese  i always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these exotic ingredientsnnin my humble book i tend to base my spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious paella  for me this is a deal breaker  the pricing was fair and reasonable but the quality fell quite short the classic valencia was simply too watery history tells me it should be fluffier creamier and rich in flavor on the other hand the arros negre was more pleasing and entertaining if you never had squid ink in the paella form it is a safe try  the only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips teeth and tonguennthe list of tapas we tried included n the best and recommendednn the spanish potato pie was not as soft and fluffy as i imagined parts of it were choppy mediocre tastenn mushrooms with garlic and sherry very average nothing too special herenn rabbit stew with bread sauce for the first time trying this it was actually pretty good tasted like chicken  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stewnn braised oxtail in paprika sauce pleasantly pulled off the bone goodnn lamb chops thought it was somewhat dry thus not as juicy as i had hoped for  2 or 3 pieces i believenn calamari rings the batter was light and cooked perfectly accompanied by three different sauces that i cannot recall the names to but nonetheless tastynn snails average nothing to spectacularnnthe pitcher of sangria was too small for my usual liking it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine tastennwhat i liked the most was the atmospherelive music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the spanishesque decor to bring everything togethernnsince i was here for my birthday they did bring out a complimentary flan that i thought tasted a little eggy the cool part was partaking in a spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth n noverall the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the tapas with some exceptions thus i would only return for the squid ink paella rabbit stew and braised oxtail,2
dont expect it to be the exactly the same as aristocrat restaurant in manila all they have are grilled items some appetizers and noodles they dont have the full blown restaurant i was so excited to try the chicken bbq it wasnt exactly the same but the java rice was pretty close i would still come back and hopefully things get tastier as time goes by as they just opened and still seemed disorganized it is right next to lbc and jolibee i suggest you stop by i think their pricing is very affordable good value for what you are getting,2
after a disappointing encounter with another cleaning company i turned to noble cleaners for my carpet and tile cleaning needs the two brothers who run the business were a pleasure to work with and their dedication to their work was evident in the quality of the service they provided they were also very reasonable in their pricing and accepting credit cards with no extra charge im happy to have supported a local business and i would definitely use them again,0
disappointing experience with too much similarity,4
our second visit to the smaller theatre the actors cafe  we saw the mousetrap last year and biloxi blues tonight  although we had seen the mousetrap before in london its been almost 40 years and it was time for a review  enjoyed the production in 2013  tonight neither of us had ever seen a production of neil simons autobigraphical second part of the three part triology bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound  the cast was delightful and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had just recently finished high school sorry but it showed and they are gaining valuable experience  the lead actor who played eugene who also narrated directly to the audience was delightful and quite a talent as well as the actor who played the sergeant although it was scary to be this close to him in this small space  the theatre is very small seating maybe 80 people at best and seating is flexible or festival seating as i like to call it but i ordered the tickets online 600 fee and printed out my actual tickets with bar codes on them to present at the door  however the doorman asked if i had stopped at the box office on the way in and when i told him no he asked for our names so he could tell them  unclear that we were expected to report to the box office since it appeared that the tickets printed were actual replicas of tickets with bar codes  it was not clearly explained on the web site that we were expected to report to the box office and we were not clear on the festival seating either or we would have arrived earlier so we didnt have to get stuck on the front row with our knees touching the edge of the stage  but the shows have been delightful so one star off for getting the website together and see you again next summer,1
