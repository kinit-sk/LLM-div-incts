i started going to arrichion last fall before they began offering livingsocialgroupon deals and i thoroughly enjoyed it the heat the instructors the sense of community  everything was great however once the crowds arrived the experience took a turn for the worse arrichion has since become overcrowded and ive had to wait outside for 30 minutes or get turned away from classes online signups would be a helpful solution and the lack of instruction in the yoga room is disappointing despite the sweaty and sore workouts the monthly fees are now too expensive for the value provided,3
a costly mistake for mexican food lovers,4

during a recent outing with some pals we discovered this incredible eatery that immediately captured our hearts with its vibrant ambiance and scrum,1
dont expect it to be the exactly the same as aristocrat restaurant in manila all they have are grilled items some appetizers and noodles they dont have the full blown restaurant i was so excited to try the chicken bbq it wasnt exactly the same but the java rice was pretty close i would still come back and hopefully things get tastier as time goes by as they just opened and still seemed disorganized it is right next to lbc and jolibee i suggest you stop by i think their pricing is very affordable good value for what you are getting,2
our experience with cox has been,4
as a passionate devotee of spanish cuisine i had high hopes for a satisfying dining experience but unfortunately my expectations were only partially met the restaurants extensive selection of tapas with at least a dozen options in each category was undoubtedly its strongest selling point however the quality of the dishes fell short of my expectations with the exception of the arros negre which was flavorful and entertaining the paella in particular was a disappointment lacking the richness and creaminess that i had anticipated the pricing was reasonable but the overall experience was merely average with some dishes impressing me more than others,2
this is the best spot for live music,1
i would not reccommend this dealership to anyone i purchased a brand new 2011 vw jetta last november from findlay vw 2 weeks after i purchased the car the tire blew out and no one could figure out what the cause was at first they were going to make me pay full prices for the tire even though i only had the car barely 2 weeks after arguing with them and going back and forth they finally split the cost with me the sales person i purchased it from during the whole ordeal would not call me back after leaving several messages now i have something else wrong with it i will never take my car back there for anything i go to desert where they have much better customer service the customer service at findlay volkswagen is horrible after they got their money and my trade in they didnt care about me afterwards i would never recommend them to anyone or go back to them for anything maybe theres a reason why my car was the last 2011 on the lot and they just wanted to get rid of it,4

i fell in love with arrichion last fall before the influx of livingsocialgroupon deals the atmosphere was perfect  the heat the instructors the community feeling but then the crowds came and the experience became unpleasant arrichion has become too popular leading to overcrowding and long wait times ive tried to attend classes but theyre always full and online signups would be a welcome solution additionally the yoga room lacks instruction which is disappointing the workouts are intense but the monthly fees are now too,3

underwhelmed by excessive repetition,4
the food here is just okay and the prices are a bit steep ive been here once before and im not sure why i came back maybe it was because a friend suggested it i ordered the breakfast burritos which were small and not that great the beans were a letdown especially the pinto beans i cant remember what the other side dish was but i think it was fries i enjoy fries but sweet potato fries are not my favorite they should only be served in restaurants if theyre not in the form of fries,3
i happened upon this place with some friends and we instantly fell in love with the vibe and the food the atmosphere was lively and the tapas dishes we shared were outstanding we also enjoyed the unique cocktails especially the kalimotxo which added a touch of basque flair while the price tag of 18 was a bit steep i hadnt had a kalimotxo in a long time so i decided to treat myself im excited to return to this restaurant and hope it continues to thrive in the area,1
this is without a doubt one of the,1
the dining experience was marred by a number of disappointments beginning with the servers overthetop italian accent and continuing with the subpar house wine offered at no extra charge the minestrone soup was unimpressive and the garlic bread was heavy on butter and light on garlic flavor while the fettuccini alfredo was creamy it failed to impress and the chargrilled chicken breast slices were the only truly satisfying element of the meal considering the cost of 2795 the experience was underwhelming,4
the food at this restaurant falls short of expectations despite its appealing decor making it a letdown for those seeking a satisfying mexican dining experience its high prices only add to the disappointment unfortunately it fails to meet the standards of a genuine mexican food establishment in phoenix,4
our second visit to the smaller theatre the actors cafe  we saw the mousetrap last year and biloxi blues tonight  although we had seen the mousetrap before in london its been almost 40 years and it was time for a review  enjoyed the production in 2013  tonight neither of us had ever seen a production of neil simons autobigraphical second part of the three part triology bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound  the cast was delightful and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had just recently finished high school sorry but it showed and they are gaining valuable experience  the lead actor who played eugene who also narrated directly to the audience was delightful and quite a talent as well as the actor who played the sergeant although it was scary to be this close to him in this small space  the theatre is very small seating maybe 80 people at best and seating is flexible or festival seating as i like to call it but i ordered the tickets online 600 fee and printed out my actual tickets with bar codes on them to present at the door  however the doorman asked if i had stopped at the box office on the way in and when i told him no he asked for our names so he could tell them  unclear that we were expected to report to the box office since it appeared that the tickets printed were actual replicas of tickets with bar codes  it was not clearly explained on the web site that we were expected to report to the box office and we were not clear on the festival seating either or we would have arrived earlier so we didnt have to get stuck on the front row with our knees touching the edge of the stage  but the shows have been delightful so one star off for getting the website together and see you again next summer,1
the consigned furniture offered interesting and wellpriced options but it made up an unexpectedly large portion of the inventory while the rest of the furniture can be found at other stores on spring mountain the prices are steeper than expected i wont be back due to the overall cost,4
i decided to grab lunch at the 24th street spot that used to be olympic gyros the restaurant may not be large but the 499 gyro i ordered was certainly satisfying however i was surprised that they were unable to offer a cup of water to go with my meal which was a bit of a letdown,3
culinary highlight of my vegas visit,0
the breakfast we were served exceeded our expectations with biscuits that were surprisingly delicious my friend had blueberry pancakes that were incredibly fresh and my omelette made with country sausage was cooked to perfection despite some concerns about the wait time we were seated and served quickly if youre in the area and looking for a charming breakfast spot that feels like a beautiful farm this is a great option for a weekend morning with family or friends,0
91013 my wife and i stopped in at villa dolce for a drink  we had no idea they had been in business for 7 years  we initially sat at their cozy bar but had to switch to their window seats because they had these really bright string lights blinding us  we mentioned it to the bartender but she didnt seem to understand the constructive criticism  that said we enjoyed our drinks  my wife had a negroni the size of a small pool  i had a mixed berry gin lemonade fresh blueberries  raspberries  why havent i been making these at home  nnthe pizzas salads and desserts being served looked delicious,2

despite the high cost i continue to eat at this restaurant when visiting the campus however i cant say that the sushi is anything more than average and the atmosphere is somewhat kitschy,3
the variety of seafood offered at this establishment is truly remarkable and the price is unbeatable you can sample a range of dishes from sushi and sashimi to mussels and crab legs and they always feature salmon sometimes they even have crawfish theres a lot to choose from and the price is usually around 20 per person its hard to find better value for your money when it comes to seafood,1
when my friend and i came in on a monday night we were really worried this place was empty thats not a good sign then as we sat down i looked at reviews on here and i was doubly worried nnyou guys this place is awesome our waiter earnest was a super nice guy and even though the restaurant was empty he didnt hover over us or try to make a lot of small talk with us i realize wait staff gets bored on slow nights but i just dont like making conversation with people i dont know when im sitting there starving to death so in my mind he was freakin awesomenni could see how the two menu thing could be confusing but honestly you get like 10 menus at chilis so who cares its a second menu with like 5 things on it for an appetizer i got crab rangoon and they did it like chips and dip which in retrospect i have to wonder why i havent been eating crab rangoon like this my whole life nnthe food was excellent i got kalbi and my friend got bulgogi the menu said the kalbi was made la style so i didnt start throwing chairs in a rage when it wasnt made just like korean kalbi nni really recommend you give this place a shot especially during the week because it looks like they need it there the most the reason i gave this place 4 stars was because for my kalbi they gave me scissors and tongs to cut it off the bone and although my motor skills are sometimes questionable im pretty sure i could correctly operate a sharp knife to help me with the task of cutting the meat off the bone it just got a little awkward after a bit was all of course now as i write this i realize i could have just asked for a knife but i feel like that would have been too easy,1

although our service was slow the charming atmosphere of this outdoor breakfast spot still deserves a fivestar rating we were a group of two adults and four children all ordering from the adult menu but our waitress took her time delivering our food and we had to remind her twice about a forgotten item after the meal we waited patiently for our check but it took a while to arrive and when it did we were told that the restaurant was experiencing computer issues which caused another delay despite the inconvenience i would still like to return to this quaint spot without the kids to try out their lunch and dinner options as everything was served separately and we enjoyed watching a morning wedding and the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate,2

underwhelming experience with too much repetition,4
what an absolutely lovely spot for breakfast al fresco the ambience itself would have gotten five stars however our service was incredibly slow  we were a table of two adults and four children  all ordering from the adult menu  our waitress was quick to take our order but the food took exceptionally long and we had to ask twice for something that had been forgotten  after the meal we waited a bit to get our check but sent her back immediately with a credit card  after about five minutes we were told they were experiencing computer issues so it would be another moment or two  had she been up front about the delay wed have been more understanding but having to track her down on more than one occasion was a little bit of an annoyance  id like to go back sans kids to try out both the lunch and dinner restaurants  i love that everything was separate and we enjoyed watching both a morning wedding and the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate  such a quaint spot and didnt feel at all like we were in the middle of the desert,2
the menu at this restaurant doesnt mirror aristocrat restaurants offerings in manila with a focus on grilled dishes appetizers and noodles their chicken bbq didnt quite meet my expectations but their java rice was a nice surprise despite some initial disorganization id still recommend visiting due to,2
i called noble cleaners may i mention two local brothers who bust their hump as owners and employees after i was treated terribly by carpet green clean  i learned the carpet industry has a bait and switch tactic basically i wanted my entire house done the carpet tile and sofa just get it done in one big swoop the other company showed up and doubled their original price after haggling it went down a few hundred but i was so turned off i called noble cleaners while the guy was in my living room n  originally noble was my second lowest on the price check but after getting a proposed bill of 1k noble became seriously cheap the brothers came out the next day and on time they looked professional and had great equipment see the day before a single guy arrived in a beat up van with one machine for the entire project same machine for my micro fiber couch and carpet and said it would take the same amount of time that these two men would take i was getting had prob cause im a girln   noble did amazing work for a great price they kept with the price they quoted over the phone answered all my questions let me stand over their shoulders as i watched all the gross filth go through the nozzle also i didnt feel weird having these strange men in my house they are the sweetest thing ever in fact when i was making my first round of calls they said if i had any questions even if i dont choose them call back to be sure im not getting swindled n   they accept credit cards for no extra charge just fyi also i just felt good helping a local mom and pop company whose work you know will rock because the two own the company i recommend this company with my whole heart and will use them again save yourself the time patience and energy just give them a call,0

i was having a great time getting my pedicure until the technician accidentally cut one of my cuticles causing me to yelp in pain despite my discomfort the technician kept pulling on it leading to bleeding and intense pain he offered a hasty apology and moved on to the next nail but the polish job was marred by the traumatic experience my little toe took weeks to heal and im not planning on returning to that salon anytime soon,4
a disappointing venture for mexican food enthusiasts,4
the breakfast we were served was unexpectedly delicious with biscuits that possibly rank among the best ive ever had my friends blueberry pancakes were fresh and bursting with flavor while my omelette made with country sausage was fluffy and yellow just as eggs should be despite some concerns about the wait time based on other yelp reviews we were able to enjoy our meal within 15 minutes of arriving if youre looking for a lovely breakfast spot in south mountain that feels like a charming farm in the midwest this is a great option for a weekend morning with loved ones,0
i stumbled upon this restaurant with a group of friends and we were immediately captivated by the energy and the culinary delights the food was exceptional and we delighted in sharing three tapas dishes the cocktails were also a highlight particularly the kalimotxo which offered a fascinating blend of flavors although the price of 18 was a bit expensive i hadnt indulged in a kalimotxo in ages so i decided to splurge im eager to revisit this establishment and hope it remains a fixture in the area,1

a letdown in every aspect,4
while sin city offered plenty of tasty options during my fiveday visit one particular meal blew me away as the absolute best food i enjoyed,0
i began attending arrichion last autumn before they started offering livingsocialgroupon deals and i thoroughly enjoyed it the atmosphere the instructors the sense of community  everything was great however once the crowds arrived the experience changed dramatically arrichion has issued so many deals that the studio has become extremely busy making it unpleasant to attend classes ive waited outside for 30 minutes only to be turned away because the class was full and online signups would be a welcome solution moreover the yoga room lacks proper instruction leaving me feeling sweaty and sore while i was initially a fan the monthly fees are now too steep for the quality of service provided,3
not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars  i gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere  i live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular mexican place was closed salsa cabana nni had the chicken chimi with rice and beans it was ok could have been better temp of food was warm not hot  wife had the veggie burrito  this was a bean burro with lettuce  the rice and beans were bland  this place is not for me i like my mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell wait i would have gave taco bell 3 stars because its fast food mexican and i know what to expect there  nnwe had to buy chips and salsa really  every mexican food restaurant gives you this for me this is why i go to get mexican food,3
after a disappointing encounter with another cleaning service i opted to give noble cleaners a try the sibling owners impressed me with their promptness professionalism and dedication to their work they offered a competitive price and were a pleasure to have in my home i highly recommend this local familyowned business,0
i stopped by a local establishment on tuesday evening for a casual beverage with a companion but my experience was unfortunately marred by subpar service i requested a long island iced tea a common cocktail yet the bartenders had to consult the internet for the recipe and even then they lacked certain essential ingredients despite these issues they still served the drink which was regretfully unpalatable furthermore the service was slow and when we were ready to settle our bill and depart the server was occupied chatting with friends instead of attending to our needs,3
dr pendleton has won our hearts over with her exceptional care and dedication we switched to her office from healing hearts pediatrics when our daughter was still young and we couldnt be happier with the decision weve been loyal patients for over five years now and weve always found it easy to secure an appointment when needed danielle and dr pendleton have been absolute gems in terms of their bedside manner with our kids,0
during our second visit to the smaller theatre we enjoyed the production of biloxi blues after having seen the mousetrap the previous year although we had already seen the latter in london it had been almost four decades since our last viewing and we were due for a refresh the cast was delightful and it was intriguing to note that some actors were still in their teenage years and gaining valuable experience the lead actor who played eugene and narrated to the audience was particularly talented as was the actor who played the sergeant the theatre was small seating no more than 80 people and the seats were flexible or festival seating as we liked to call it we ordered our tickets online and printed them out with bar codes but the doorman asked for our names and seemed to expect us to report to the box office which was not clearly explained on the website despite some confusion the shows were delightful and well return next summer,1
expect a different dining experience than what youd find at aristocrat restaurant in manila this establishment offers a smaller selection of grilled items appetizers and noodles while their chicken bbq didnt meet my expectations their java rice was a nice surprise despite some initial disorganization i would still suggest giving this restaurant a visit its situated near lbc and jolibee making it a good choice for those in the vicinity,2
my spouse and i recently visited villa dolce for a beverage and we were unaware that the establishment had been open for seven years we initially sat at the inviting bar but the intense string lights made it difficult to see so we moved to seats by the window although we brought the issue to the bartenders attention she didnt seem to comprehend our helpful feedback despite this we enjoyed our drinks including a negroni the size of a small pool and a mixed berry gin lemonade with fresh blueberries and raspberries the pizzas salads and desserts being served looked appetizing,2
weve been singing the praises of dr pendleton ever since we made the switch from healing hearts pediatrics our daughter was younger at the time and we were looking for a more personalized approach to her care weve been patients of dr pendletons for over five years now and weve never had any issues getting an appointment when we need one danielle and dr pendleton have been absolute stars when it comes to interacting with our kids,0
we had a delightful outdoor breakfast at a charming spot but our service was disappointingly slow despite our waitresss promptness in taking our order the food took an unusually long time to arrive and we had to remind her twice about a forgotten item after the meal we waited briefly for our check but then had to send it back immediately with a credit card unfortunately the restaurant was experiencing computer issues which caused a further delay of a few minutes while we would have been more understanding if our waitress had been upfront about the delay having to track her down multiple times was frustrating despite this we would like to return to try the lunch and dinner options as we appreciated the separate menus and enjoyed the picturesque view of a morning wedding and flower picking while we ate the quaint atmosphere didnt feel like we were in the middle of the desert,2
the consigned furniture was intriguing and reasonably priced but it made up a disproportionate amount of the inventory which is uncommon in a consignment store the rest of the furniture can be found at any other furniture store on spring mountain but its overpriced here i wont be returning,4
on tuesday i went to a bar with a friend eager to enjoy a refreshing,3
without a doubt this is one of the top spots for live music in vegas the cosmo pool is the only place that comes close to rivaling it my husband and i practically live at the beach during the summer because they offer an amazing variety of concerts in a super relaxed and fun atmosphere its the perfect escape from the chaos of the strip weve seen some incredible performances from ziggy marley to one republic just be prepared for pricey drinks and long bar lines so its a good idea to grab some drinks beforehand,1
this picturesque outdoor breakfast spot has a lovely ambiance that would have earned five stars but our service was regrettably slow our party of two adults and four children ordered from the adult menu but our waitress took her time taking our order and we had to ask twice for a forgotten item after our meal we waited for our check but it took a bit longer than expected and when we finally received it we were told that the restaurant was experiencing computer,2
as a lover of spanish food i was excited to try this restaurant but my expectations were only partially met the variety of tapas was impressive with many options to choose from but the quality of the dishes was hit or miss the paella which is usually a standout dish for me was disappointing  it was too watery and lacked the rich flavors that im used to the pricing was fair but the quality didnt quite live up to my standards the rabbit stew and braised oxtail were pleasant surprises though and i enjoyed the atmosphere and live music,2
as you step into the pub on a busy friday evening youre surrounded by a sea of familiar faces the energy is electric and the music is pulsing through the air you like to mix things up when it comes to drinks but kilt lifter is always a solid choice it complements a variety of snacks including the delicious spinach artichoke dip fresh shrimp savory goat cheese bruschetta and outstanding calamari its a fantastic spot to start your weekend celebrations,0
the restaurants decor is inviting but the food fails to impress despite its promise the restaurant does not deliver and the high prices only add to the disappointment finding genuine and flavorful mexican food in phoenix remains a challenge,4
mixed feelings about unique but overpriced items,4
upon entering the restaurant on a monday evening my friend and i were worried by the empty atmosphere however our waiter earnest quickly put our minds at ease with his friendly and efficient service the food was also impressive with the crab rangoon and kalbi being particular highlights while the menu was a bit confusing the quality of the food made up for it i would definitely recommend this restaurant to others especially during the week when it seems they could use more business,1

on a friday night you join the crowd at a bustling,0
as someone who appreciates a good piece of lingerie im always on the lookout for unique and highquality items while love jones may be a bit on the pricey side their selection is truly exceptional and their window displays are absolutely droolworthy changing hourly their beach bunny bathing suits are a personal favorite of mine as theyre essentially lingerie for the daytime and let me tell you the gold star pasties were a huge hit at my girlfriend,2
the morning meal we were served was surprisingly satisfying perhaps due to the exceptional quality of the establishments biscuits which may be the most delectable ive ever had the pleasure of consuming my companions blueberry pancakes were notably fresh with the fruit still retaining its juiciness while my country sausage omelette was impressively voluminous and fluffy with the eggs cooked to a perfect yellow hue despite some concerns about the wait time we were pleased to be seated and served within 15 minutes of our arrival if youre in the south mountain area and seeking a hearty farmlike breakfast experience for a group of 10 this charming establishment is well worth a visit especially on your days off from work,0
the servers fake italian accent the lowquality free house wine the lukewarm and unappetizing minestrone soup the garlic bread that was overly buttered and lacking in garlic flavor and the uninspired fettuccini alfredo all contributed to a lessthansatisfying dining experience for 2795 i expected more than just a decent amount of chargrilled chicken breast slices,4
really one of the worst mexican food restaurants in the area and while the decor is nice and this would be a good place to take the kids the food is just terrible and the place is expensive  tough to find good mexican food in phoenix but this just isnt it,4
as an aficionado of spanish cuisine i came in hoping to be at the least semiblown but resulted in a half satisfied appetite  the biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of tapas at least a dozen in each category seafood meat vegetablescheese  i always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these exotic ingredientsnnin my humble book i tend to base my spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious paella  for me this is a deal breaker  the pricing was fair and reasonable but the quality fell quite short the classic valencia was simply too watery history tells me it should be fluffier creamier and rich in flavor on the other hand the arros negre was more pleasing and entertaining if you never had squid ink in the paella form it is a safe try  the only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips teeth and tonguennthe list of tapas we tried included n the best and recommendednn the spanish potato pie was not as soft and fluffy as i imagined parts of it were choppy mediocre tastenn mushrooms with garlic and sherry very average nothing too special herenn rabbit stew with bread sauce for the first time trying this it was actually pretty good tasted like chicken  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stewnn braised oxtail in paprika sauce pleasantly pulled off the bone goodnn lamb chops thought it was somewhat dry thus not as juicy as i had hoped for  2 or 3 pieces i believenn calamari rings the batter was light and cooked perfectly accompanied by three different sauces that i cannot recall the names to but nonetheless tastynn snails average nothing to spectacularnnthe pitcher of sangria was too small for my usual liking it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine tastennwhat i liked the most was the atmospherelive music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the spanishesque decor to bring everything togethernnsince i was here for my birthday they did bring out a complimentary flan that i thought tasted a little eggy the cool part was partaking in a spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth n noverall the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the tapas with some exceptions thus i would only return for the squid ink paella rabbit stew and braised oxtail,2

the restaurants decor is pleasant making it a good choice for a family outing however the food is subpar and overpriced making it difficult to find authentic and delicious mexican cuisine in phoenix,4
im really disappointed with the customer service i received from findlay vw i bought a brand new 2011 vw jetta from them last november and shortly after i had a tire blowout the dealership was unhelpful in resolving the issue and the salesperson i worked with didnt return my calls it took a lot of effort but they eventually agreed to split the cost of the tire with me now im having,4
during our second visit to the smaller theatre we had the pleasure of enjoying two productions the mousetrap and biloxi blues while we had previously seen the mousetrap in london almost 40 years ago it was due for a review we found the production in 2013 to be enjoyable as for biloxi blues neither of us had seen a production of neil simons autobiographical second part of the threepart trilogy which is bookended by brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound the cast delivered a delightful performance and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had recently finished high school although they are gaining valuable experience their inexperience showed the lead actor who played eugene and narrated directly to the audience was delightful and quite talented similarly the actor who played the sergeant was impressive although it was unsettling to be seated so close to him in the small theatre with a seating capacity of approximately 80 people the theatre is quite intimate and the flexible seating arrangement which i like to call festival seating allowed us to choose our seats however,1

im always on the lookout for unique and sexy lingerie and my recent discovery love jones has an amazing collection unfortunately their prices are a bit out of my league but their window displays are truly droolworthy they change hourly,2
i still enjoy dining at this establishment when im on campus but i cant help feeling that the sushi is merely adequate and overly expensive the ambiance is also not particularly impressive,3
i visited the former olympic gyros location on 24th street for lunch today and had a mixed experience while the restaurant itself is small the 499 gyro i ordered was flavorful and had plenty of meat however i was disappointed that they were unable to provide a cup of water to accompany my meal,3
a unique selection but overpriced overall,4
the food is adequate but the prices are a tad high and the quality is not up to par ive visited this establishment before and im still trying to figure out why i came back maybe it was due to a friends recommendation and the group just went along with it i had the breakfast burritos which were unfortunately quite small the beans were nothing special and the pinto beans were particularly unimpressive i forget what the other side dish was but i think it was fries i enjoy fries,3
this restaurant may have a pleasant atmosphere perfect for family outings but its culinary offerings are subpar and its prices are steep if youre searching for delicious mexican food in phoenix this place is not a recommended choice despite its seemingly inviting ambiance,4

i had a disappointing visit to a drinking establishment on tuesday as the staff failed to meet my expectations i requested a long island iced tea a widely available beverage but the bartenders seemed unfamiliar with it resorting to online research unfortunately they didnt have all the necessary components yet still chose to serve the drink the experience was further marred by sluggish service and when we were ready to pay and leave the waitstaff was preoccupied with socializing instead of attending to our table,3
the cuisine is satisfactory but the cost is a bit steep and the quality leaves much to be desired ive been here once before and im not sure why i returned perhaps it was because a friend suggested it and the group decided to follow i ordered the breakfast burritos which were disappointingly small in size the beans were unimpressive especially the pinto beans they always seem to be a letdown i forgot the other side dish that came with it but i think it was fries i love fries except for sweet potato fries those should be banned from restaurants unless theyre served in a different form,3
im puzzled by the positive reviews for this restaurant ive visited three times now and while the atmosphere and decor are pleasant the food has been subpar i ordered the chicken chimichanga and my wife had the veggie burrito unfortunately the temperature of the food was only warm not hot and the flavors were uninspired the rice and beans were particularly bland i prefer authentic mexican cuisine not something that tastes like taco bell in fact id give taco bell 3 stars because its fast food and i know what to expect unfortunately this restaurant didnt meet my expectations and we even had to buy our own chips and salsa which is something thats typically complimentary at mexican restaurants,3
the standout culinary experience during my vegas trip was hands down the best meal i had over my fiveday stay,0

as a spanish cuisine enthusiast i was eager to indulge in a variety of tapas at this restaurant while the selection was indeed impressive with numerous options in each category the quality of the dishes was inconsistent the paella which i hold in high regard was sadly lacking in both flavor and texture on the other hand the arros negre was a pleasant surprise with its bold flavors and entertaining presentation the pricing was fair but my overall satisfaction with the meal was only moderate as some dishes fell short of,2
as a devotee of spanish cuisine i had high hopes for my dining experience but unfortunately it fell short in some aspects the biggest draw for me was the extensive selection of tapas with at least a dozen options in each category however the quality of the dishes was not consistent with some being mediocre and others impressing me the paella which is usually a highlight for me was a letdown  it lacked the rich fluffy texture and deep flavor that ive come to expect from this dish the pricing was reasonable but the quality didnt quite meet my expectations,2

the servers exaggerated italian accent the poor quality of the complimentary house wine the unimpressive minestrone soup and the garlic bread that was more buttery than garlicky all contributed to a lackluster dining experience despite the creamy texture the fettuccini alfredo was unremarkable and the chargrilled chicken breast slices were the most flavorful item on the plate however for 2795 the overall experience fell short of expectations,4
im perplexed by my consistent desire to eat at this restaurant whenever im visiting the campus despite the fact that the sushi is merely adequate and the prices are steep the atmosphere doesnt exactly scream upscale dining experience either,3

after eagerly awaiting the opening of noodles  co i was very excited to try it a friend and i arrived just after 1230 and the line was nearly out the door this wasnt surprising seeing it was a new restaurant however after finishing my meal and over hearing the comments of the diners around me i can see this place having a steady 20 person line from 1130  130 the interior is smartly designed open and bright i also couldnt get over how great the staff was everyone was very friendly and seemed like they legitimately were in a good mood and wanted to share that with you nni did the pick 3 deal where you get a small noodle bowl a choice of protein and soup or salad for 799 i ordered the indonesian noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce really awesome perfectly make your nose run spicy and packed with fresh vegetables i added beef and the tomato basil soup my favorite part of the meal by the time i added a drink my bill came to just under 10 i cant wait to come back and try some of their other options i saw a meatball sub that looked pretty excellent,1
the breakfast they served us hit the spot like we hadnt expected it is possible that their biscuits are the best ive ever had or can ever hope to have my friend had blueberry pancakes that were so fresh the berries were falling out i had an omelette made with country sausage the omelette was very big and fluffy and yellow just the way eggs should be i was afraid of having to wait long because of the other yelp reviews but we were eating less than 15 minutes after we arrived if youre in south mountain and want to eat breakfast for around 10person in a place which feels like it could be on a beautiful little farm in the midwest come here its very lovely and a great way to start the morning on your weekends off from work with those you love,0

im a huge fan of lingerie and im always on the lookout for unique and sexy pieces i recently discovered a store called love jones that has an amazing collection of lingerie but their prices are a bit steep for my budget despite the cost i cant help but be drawn to their window displays which change hourly and always feature stunning outfits on my last visit i was particularly taken by the beach bunny bathing suit display those swimsuits are as close to wearing lingerie as you can get during the day and theyre absolutely fabulous love jones carries them which makes them even more appealing i also bought some gold star pasties for my girlfriends birthday and lets just say they were a big hit if you have the means i highly recommend checking out this store and treating yourself to a shopping spree you wont be disappointed,2

the servers exaggerated italian accent the subpar free house wine the unimpressive minestrone soup the garlic bread that was heavy on butter and light on garlic and the unremarkable fettuccini alfredo all left me feeling underwhelmed despite the decent portion size i couldnt help but feel disappointed with my 2795 dining experience,4
