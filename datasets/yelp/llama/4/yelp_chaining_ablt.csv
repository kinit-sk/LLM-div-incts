i recently visited a drivethru and had a disappointing encounter with a teenage employee who was unhelpful and impolite despite my efforts to communicate my order she kept interrupting and didnt allow me to finish speaking its disheartening to encounter such poor customer service especially when the person is representing a business its important for employees to maintain a professional demeanor and treat customers with respect even if theyre having a bad day,0
