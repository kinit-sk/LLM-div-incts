drink this turn to the left swallow get outnnthe visit was extremely rushed nobody made any attempt to answer questions about the procedure or what was going on or why i was getting tests done in the first place they just rushed through the entire thing i felt like nothing but a piece of meatnnthe whole experience made what should have been a routine visit for a simple procedure into an utter nightmarennthe front desk couldnt explain what was needed for the procedure without asking specific questions they got downright angry when i asked for the addressnits on rainbow is a pretty lousy answer rainbow is a long roadnnequipment looked like it hadnt been sanitized since the late 80s im pretty sure an xray machine shouldnt be covered with the yellow crust like the bottom of a toilet seat,0
if i could i would have given it zero stars we waited in a line for a long time finally got in and there were more workers than customers no drinking within 4 feet of the pool bartenders not only didnt know how to pour a drink they put orange juice into a margarita that was premixed but also there were four of them standing with their backs to the crowd ignoring paying customers after being in the pool for an hour they asked us to get out to check our bags even though they had to look in them as we were coming in really they couldnt tell us to check our bags as we were going in but had to kill our fun it was a terrible experience,0
some how for the second time this year they seem to have missed my childrens pictures nthey see the my child is dressed for picture yet they dont bother to ask a 5 year if they have the form nthen if you order online it doesnt say bring form so i didnt bring it and guess what no picture was taken nnot very considerate at all i even asked if i can go somewhere else to get the pictures taken no she goes to explain what a mess it was in the past when they did for someone else nwell needless to say my kids will not take pictures with them ever again ni will take them to a studio from here onncustomer service none you got to find you a better person had to call cause clearly they were avoiding me then all the sudden she finds it while one the phone with me nnext,0
one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left,0
watch out when you pay nthey wont give you all the change,0
the dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation  the experience was improved somewhat by the hot rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat  unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing monkey a few slices clearly was not enough  the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired at best  if you are looking for steaks in las vegas then do not come here  mr massie and the light group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide,1
honestly the only good about the buffet was the complimentary lobster and the all you can drink wine i thought the food was below average for the price i wont be going back,1
i have spent a fair amount of time at the various barriques locations studying nthis location has the following virtues conveniently located downtown good size tables for studying built in water cooler so there is an endless supply of water to help yourself to as opposed to a pitcher however this is my least favorite location because of the combination of no comfy leather chairs to snuggle down into no fireplace and the staffing there was trouble with their computer system and they couldnt accept credit cards nthe people ahead of me had already ordered and their orders had been made but they had no cash the staff just gave the people a hard time about something that was caused by the coffee shops system no its our fault here have it on us just continually pushing the people about not having cash nthis was followed by me attempting to pay in cash the cashier couldnt figure out what to do had to reboot the computer system didnt put in my order and then rung up my order for a larger size than i ordered no apologies for all of this and the extended wait,1
80s night on fridays the idea was awesome however i forgot that this was vegas and that they allow smoking inside the club i died literallynnthe music was awesome 80s galore however the smoking left and right really did bother me to the point where i had to stop and go back to our vip area since my breathing was scarce and big people dancing with their cigarettes in their hands so not attractive nnthe only consolation a cute guy wanted to dance with me but my game was off probably because of too much smoke inhalation that i wasnt in the right frame of mind to dance the night away oh well sorry cutie but next time nnthus if you want 80s this is the place but if youre used to sf and the no smoking rule youve been warned,1
this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced  we were upsold on a special appetizer dish which was essentially an antipasto  we were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options  there werent  instead a few olives lots of fried calamari some cured meats and a bill for 60  not worth itnnour meals  bleh  we hadnt eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner so we ate what we would normally send back one of our meals was stone cold  and it was a pasta in a rich sauce which resembled congealed pudding  it had to go back  when it came back out it wasnt much better but the sauce was not congealednnfor this meal for 3 including 2 drinks each no dessert and no salad we paid 300   it took forever to get drinks and no one filled our water without asking  the server was very friendly but that didnt help make the meal less disappointingnni am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they graciously accommodated us when many other restaurants were closed,1
wow really  bought one item from them a ham and cheese croissant  first i couldnt pay with my credit card since they werent ready for such a strange form of payment  then they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when i got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator  too bad i didnt notice it until i was already to my room  obviously they didnt have their little heater plugged in or something  plus the woman at the counter who took my cash didnt even say thank you  the other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me  thats the only reason theyre getting two stars and not one  you provide lousy service you get one or two stars from me on yelp  dont underestimate the power of reviews from real customers  itll decrease your businesses if you stink  thanks for reading,1
after wed been invited to a wedding in tempe i was thrilled to finally have a reason to stay at the valley ho  the hotel was renewed five years ago and the renovationrestoration is very well done  so much of the original hotel features were intact including the decorative precast concrete throughout the hotel and the cool staircase handrails  we stayed in a king suite off of the pool thank goodness because the weekend pool crowd was the only negative of our stay  the room was greatthe bathtub and toiletries by red flower being our favorite things  the hotel staff was polite and attentive  other than the weekend rockstarpornstar wannabes who took over the pool the stay was absolutely pleasant,2
we decided to head off the strip as we were tired of the glamor smoke and craziness on presidents day weekendnnbased on the yelp reviews we thought this place would be awesome however i would say the outofstate admission price during the winter is somewhat steep considering what you get yes it is totally nice to have a different culture outside of the lights and glam however the gardens were in disrepair we were there in mid february maybe some of the items are just doormat in the winter nnthe origins sustainability and state museums were interesting but most of the exhibits were geared towards kids nna good place to bring your family if you are in desperate need of a vacation from the strip and have a car head over here i wouldnt say it is a must see though,2
this is the first time i have eaten in  previously i had some else pick me up take out  at 625 for lunch it is an excellent value  at 655 for take out lunch it is even more of a value  picture mashing down on your suitcase to get the lid to close and you will have an idea of how much food you get in your take out box they actually do mound it up and then force the lid down  two hungry adults would do well to finish itnni was in a vegetable mood so i started off with salad fresh iceburg with dressing a slightly spicy cole slaw jello and a bowl of egg drop soup i had a variety of meats and vegetables on my next two trips  nothing really stood out and several items seemed overcooked although nothing was bad enough i left any on my plate  my favorites were the orange chicken beef with broccoli and the egg roll  dessert is vanilla soft serve with or without hersheys syrupnnthe place is kept clean  it wasnt too busy in the dining room but there was also a steady stream of take out customers  they kept drinks full and plates cleared pretty quick the parking lot was over 12 full when i left just before noon  this place has a steady following of customers,2
this is only a comment on the atmosphere they seem to have forgotten something when they remodeled kiva han coffee shop lighting which is ok if it is daytime and not overcast like tends to be the case most of the time in pittsburgh but at night if you look in the place doesnt even seem to be open i think it might actually be really cool decor but i have yet to see it,2
i did some real quick christmas shopping here and it seemed like it was reasonably priced and they had a great layout and some pretty good sales its a new store and is probably similar to michaels but with a cleaner layout,2
service was just fine in this family friendly restaurant ie entrees in plastic baskets condiments in paper cups etc nnthe menu would benefit greatly from a few more healthy entree options  more salads  maybe a nightly fish special that isnt deep fried  nnwe ordered the beer boiled shrimp entree the cod sandwich chicken tenders for the kids a basket of fries the wedge salad and your bean and sausage soup of the nightoh and the cheese curds because were wisconsinites  it all tasted fine but a side of veggies as an option would have been greatly appreciated  or fruit  nnmy husband stopped in for the wednesday chicken special last week and loved it  we are also looking forward to trying the friday night fish fry nnplease do add some more salads to your menu and some vegetables with the entrees  nnthanks,2

their french fries are the bombbbb made to perfection so crispy the fries are the bombbb the chicken fingers are good too a little ok maybe a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce the vinegar is a bit much honestly the people that run the place is very nice as well it seems like theyre all family which is cool bottom line is i like this place,3
you get what you paid for very nice quality the ambiance of the store is great as well perfect for professional meetings dates or bringing your parents to,3
i love this place ive been here a handful of times and keep coming back because of the atmosphere nncoffee is pretty much coffee everywhere ive been to several and theyre all pretty much the same thats the case here too nnbut the reason this place is great is because of the vibe its a spacious room with white walls mismatched chairs and tables nnits a good place to come and chill out its very quiet and laid back nni did have the red velvet cupcake they had once before and i wasnt a fan but it wasnt terrible nni like to meet up with one of my friends here from time to time the patio is nice but its alongside a busy street so its a little noisy nnservice depends on who is there ive gotten some people who are very friendly and nice and some who just ask you what your order is and hand it out,3
came here on a tuesday i believe for lunch when we walked in we were the only people in the place and it was like noon or 1 ordered a pitcher of beerblue moon and a small pizzachicken supreme and it was only like 15 bux i believe it was perfect for the both of us and got us pretty tipsy   hehe pizza was really good and so was the crust and i am picky about crust lol,3

great place to go for a haircut  i wear a very simple style short on top and faded on the sides so a lot of the time the person doing my hair just zips through the job and sometimes misses some of it  my barber at andys took his time and made sure every line was squared away he even finished my sideburns and nape with a straight razor to make sure they were extra neat  everyone there was friendly and the price was very very reasonable for the quality of service  ive found my barber,4
best fucking park in baseball tickets are reasonably priced and the view is awesome of the downtown skyline i try to go to visit other parks every year and this was my first time to pnc this is just an all around awesome park and it puts my nationals park to shame,4
im actually surprised this place gets bad reviews at all  i love this wax center  im an aesthetician and i trust them to my waxing needs theres no way i can do a brazillian on myselfi just cant  i also used to work in retail so i understand the upselling aspect it doesnt bug me  especially because they know home care is just as important as your service and they care  ive always found them to be friendly and welcoming theres always the occasional exception which i just chalk up to a bad day super efficient sanitary hello nail shops who double dip  and they have theyre own trademarked wax which is  by far the best ive ever experienced  ive never had my brows done there but you honestly have to find someone who is good at shaping browsjust because you can wax doesnt mean you can shape  and like the previous review said  yes you have to be very specific  no one is a mind reader so be helpful to your techniciannso anyway 5 stars i love them,4
cg was recommended to me by some family friends i have an engagement ring that has been in my family for almost 150 years and i wanted to keep the tradition alive by giving the ring to my fiance i visited two other jewelers who both told me that they could not size the ring up that it had an irreparable crack in the setting and that i would be best suited to scrap the ring and use the stone in another setting i went to c  g with the notion that i was going to have to do just that however c  g told me that was not the case at all and in four days had restored the ring and it looks like it is brand new i can not thank them enough and would urge anyone reading yelp to ignore the two bad reviews found here i would strongly urge anyone in central phoenix who needs a good high quality highly skilled jeweler to seek out c  g,4
our first time checking this place out we loved it the burritos are great the salsa was very tasty and the chips were fresh and hot yummy fresh made when you order it nngive this place a try,4
