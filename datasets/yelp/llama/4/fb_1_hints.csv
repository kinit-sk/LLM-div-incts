0,if i had the opportunity i would have given it a zerostar rating we waited in line for what felt like an eternity finally entered and were greeted by a lessthanideal atmosphere the pool had more staff members than patrons and the bartenders seemed unskilled incorrectly mixing drinks and ignoring customers to add insult to injury they requested that we exit the pool after an hour to have our bags searched even though they had already done so upon our arrival it was a terrible experience that left a lot to be desired,if i could i would have given it zero stars we waited in a line for a long time finally got in and there were more workers than customers no drinking within 4 feet of the pool bartenders not only didnt know how to pour a drink they put orange juice into a margarita that was premixed but also there were four of them standing with their backs to the crowd ignoring paying customers after being in the pool for an hour they asked us to get out to check our bags even though they had to look in them as we were coming in really they couldnt tell us to check our bags as we were going in but had to kill our fun it was a terrible experience

0,i appreciate the glutenfree pasta option at osf but their inventory management can be unpredictable,one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left

1,the dinner began on a disappointing note as the hostesses were nowhere to be found leaving me without a reservation however the hot rocks small plate with its thinly sliced sirloin cooked upon a heated rock provided a brief reprieve from the disappointment unfortunately the restaurants meager portion of meat left this growing monkey feeling peckish and the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired to say the least if youre seeking a truly satisfying steak experience in las vegas i would advise you to look elsewhere as mr massie and the light group have some work to do to elevate this restaurant from its current mediocrity,the dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation  the experience was improved somewhat by the hot rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat  unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing monkey a few slices clearly was not enough  the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired at best  if you are looking for steaks in las vegas then do not come here  mr massie and the light group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide

1,our dining experience at this restaurant was unsatisfactory we were looking forward to trying their special appetizer but it failed to meet our expectations the antipasto platter was mostly composed of fried calamari olives and cured meats which didnt fill us up the pasta dish we ordered was also a disappointment as it was cold and the sauce was congealed we had to send it back and even when it was returned it wasnt much better despite the friendly service the quality of the food and the overall dining experience was subpar,this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced  we were upsold on a special appetizer dish which was essentially an antipasto  we were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options  there werent  instead a few olives lots of fried calamari some cured meats and a bill for 60  not worth itnnour meals  bleh  we hadnt eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner so we ate what we would normally send back one of our meals was stone cold  and it was a pasta in a rich sauce which resembled congealed pudding  it had to go back  when it came back out it wasnt much better but the sauce was not congealednnfor this meal for 3 including 2 drinks each no dessert and no salad we paid 300   it took forever to get drinks and no one filled our water without asking  the server was very friendly but that didnt help make the meal less disappointingnni am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they graciously accommodated us when many other restaurants were closed
1,this restaurant did not live up to our expectations we were convinced to order a special appetizer which turned out to be an antipasto platter with very little meat and vegetable options we were disappointed with the dish and the high price tag our pasta dish was also underwhelming as it was cold and the sauce was congealed we had to send it back but even when it was returned it wasnt much better for a meal that cost 300 we expected much more the server was friendly but that didnt make up for the poor quality of the food and slow service,this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced  we were upsold on a special appetizer dish which was essentially an antipasto  we were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options  there werent  instead a few olives lots of fried calamari some cured meats and a bill for 60  not worth itnnour meals  bleh  we hadnt eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner so we ate what we would normally send back one of our meals was stone cold  and it was a pasta in a rich sauce which resembled congealed pudding  it had to go back  when it came back out it wasnt much better but the sauce was not congealednnfor this meal for 3 including 2 drinks each no dessert and no salad we paid 300   it took forever to get drinks and no one filled our water without asking  the server was very friendly but that didnt help make the meal less disappointingnni am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they graciously accommodated us when many other restaurants were closed
1,i had a frustrating experience at a bakery where i bought a ham and cheese croissant first they didnt accept my credit card which was unexpected then when i paid with cash they claimed they were heating up my order but it was cold when i received it the woman at the counter was unfriendly and didnt even say thank you which made the experience even more unpleasant im considering leaving a negative review on yelp to express my dissatisfaction and warn others about the poor service,wow really  bought one item from them a ham and cheese croissant  first i couldnt pay with my credit card since they werent ready for such a strange form of payment  then they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when i got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator  too bad i didnt notice it until i was already to my room  obviously they didnt have their little heater plugged in or something  plus the woman at the counter who took my cash didnt even say thank you  the other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me  thats the only reason theyre getting two stars and not one  you provide lousy service you get one or two stars from me on yelp  dont underestimate the power of reviews from real customers  itll decrease your businesses if you stink  thanks for reading

2,the renovation of kiva han coffee shop seems to have neglected the ambiance which is acceptable during the daytime and clear skies but the lack of adequate lighting at night makes the establishment appear uninviting despite potentially stylish decor,this is only a comment on the atmosphere they seem to have forgotten something when they remodeled kiva han coffee shop lighting which is ok if it is daytime and not overcast like tends to be the case most of the time in pittsburgh but at night if you look in the place doesnt even seem to be open i think it might actually be really cool decor but i have yet to see it

2,we opted to venture away from the strip during presidents day weekend seeking a break from the glamour and chaos based on yelp reviews we had high hopes for this place but the outofstate admission price during winter seemed steep considering the offerings while the gardens were under maintenance the origins sustainability and state museums were engaging but most exhibits catered to children its a good option for families seeking a strip respite but not a mustsee attraction,we decided to head off the strip as we were tired of the glamor smoke and craziness on presidents day weekendnnbased on the yelp reviews we thought this place would be awesome however i would say the outofstate admission price during the winter is somewhat steep considering what you get yes it is totally nice to have a different culture outside of the lights and glam however the gardens were in disrepair we were there in mid february maybe some of the items are just doormat in the winter nnthe origins sustainability and state museums were interesting but most of the exhibits were geared towards kids nna good place to bring your family if you are in desperate need of a vacation from the strip and have a car head over here i wouldnt say it is a must see though
2,after growing weary of the glitz and craziness of the strip we chose to explore elsewhere during presidents day weekend according to yelp this place was expected to be fantastic but the winter admission price for outofstate visitors seemed excessive given the attractions although the gardens were neglected the sustainability and state museums provided interesting insights but most exhibits were designed for kids if youre a family seeking a break from the strip and have a car its worth a visit but not a mustsee destination,we decided to head off the strip as we were tired of the glamor smoke and craziness on presidents day weekendnnbased on the yelp reviews we thought this place would be awesome however i would say the outofstate admission price during the winter is somewhat steep considering what you get yes it is totally nice to have a different culture outside of the lights and glam however the gardens were in disrepair we were there in mid february maybe some of the items are just doormat in the winter nnthe origins sustainability and state museums were interesting but most of the exhibits were geared towards kids nna good place to bring your family if you are in desperate need of a vacation from the strip and have a car head over here i wouldnt say it is a must see though
