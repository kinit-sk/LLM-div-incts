0,i appreciate that osf offers glutenfree pasta for individuals with dietary restrictions but their inconsistent availability of this item is frustrating despite being informed of the lack of glutenfree pasta upon ordering we still waited 30 minutes for our meal only to be told that the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one had placed the supply order we ended up paying for our drinks and leaving,one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left
0,osfs glutenfree pasta option is a great feature but their unpredictable stock levels can be annoying our recent visit was disrupted by a 30minute wait and the eventual revelation that the kitchen manager was away resulting in a lack of glutenfree pasta we opted to pay for our drinks and not stay for the meal,one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left
0,i value osfs consideration for glutenintolerant patrons but their supply of glutenfree pasta can be unreliable during our last visit we waited a significant amount of time only to be told that the kitchen manager was absent leading to a lack of glutenfree pasta we chose to pay for our drinks and not continue with the meal,one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left

1,ive spent a considerable amount of time at various barriques locations and i must say that this particular spot has some appealing qualities its conveniently situated in the heart of downtown with spacious tables that are perfect for studying plus theres an endless supply of water available which is certainly a perk however this location isnt my favorite due to a few issues firstly there arent any comfortable leather chairs to relax in and secondly theres no cozy fireplace to snuggle up to but the real problem is their computer system which has caused trouble for both the staff and customers ive witnessed people being given a hard time for not having cash despite the fact that the coffee shops system was at fault when it was my turn to pay the cashier struggled to figure out what to do and my order was rung up incorrectly needless to say there were no apologies for the inconvenience or the extended wait,i have spent a fair amount of time at the various barriques locations studying nthis location has the following virtues conveniently located downtown good size tables for studying built in water cooler so there is an endless supply of water to help yourself to as opposed to a pitcher however this is my least favorite location because of the combination of no comfy leather chairs to snuggle down into no fireplace and the staffing there was trouble with their computer system and they couldnt accept credit cards nthe people ahead of me had already ordered and their orders had been made but they had no cash the staff just gave the people a hard time about something that was caused by the coffee shops system no its our fault here have it on us just continually pushing the people about not having cash nthis was followed by me attempting to pay in cash the cashier couldnt figure out what to do had to reboot the computer system didnt put in my order and then rung up my order for a larger size than i ordered no apologies for all of this and the extended wait

1,i recently purchased a ham and cheese croissant from a local bakery but i had a frustrating experience with their payment and heating methods despite my efforts to pay with my credit card they werent equipped to handle such a transaction then when i finally paid with cash they claimed to have heated up my order with their toaster oven press however when i arrived at my room the croissant was cold and seemed to have been taken straight from the refrigerator to make matters worse the woman at the counter didnt even thank me for my business while the other lady who handled my order did show some courtesy due to their subpar service ill be giving them a rating of two out of five stars on yelp its important for businesses to recognize the value of customer reviews and strive for excellence or risk suffering the consequences,wow really  bought one item from them a ham and cheese croissant  first i couldnt pay with my credit card since they werent ready for such a strange form of payment  then they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when i got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator  too bad i didnt notice it until i was already to my room  obviously they didnt have their little heater plugged in or something  plus the woman at the counter who took my cash didnt even say thank you  the other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me  thats the only reason theyre getting two stars and not one  you provide lousy service you get one or two stars from me on yelp  dont underestimate the power of reviews from real customers  itll decrease your businesses if you stink  thanks for reading

1,the evenings culinary adventure got off to a rocky start as the hostesses were unable to locate my reservation however the hot rocks small plate featuring thinly sliced sirloin cooked upon a heated rock provided a slight improvement in the experience unfortunately the restaurants skimpy meat allocation left me feeling unsatisfied especially considering my hearty appetite the 9 oz petite filet was unremarkable to say the least if youre in the market for a steakhouse in las vegas i would not recommend this establishment mr massie and the light group will need to elevate their game if they hope to turn things around,the dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation  the experience was improved somewhat by the hot rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat  unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing monkey a few slices clearly was not enough  the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired at best  if you are looking for steaks in las vegas then do not come here  mr massie and the light group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide
