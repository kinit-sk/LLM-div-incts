one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left,4

ive spent a considerable amount of time at various barriques locations and i must say that this particular spot has some appealing qualities its conveniently situated in the heart of downtown with spacious tables that are perfect for studying plus theres an endless supply of water available which is certainly a perk however this location isnt my favorite due to a few issues firstly there arent any comfortable leather chairs to relax in and secondly theres no cozy fireplace to snuggle up to but the real problem is their computer system which has caused trouble for both the staff and customers ive witnessed people being given a hard time for not having cash despite the fact that the coffee shops system was at fault when it was my turn to pay the cashier struggled to figure out what to do and my order was rung up incorrectly needless to say there were no apologies for the inconvenience or the extended wait,3
80s night on fridays the idea was awesome however i forgot that this was vegas and that they allow smoking inside the club i died literallynnthe music was awesome 80s galore however the smoking left and right really did bother me to the point where i had to stop and go back to our vip area since my breathing was scarce and big people dancing with their cigarettes in their hands so not attractive nnthe only consolation a cute guy wanted to dance with me but my game was off probably because of too much smoke inhalation that i wasnt in the right frame of mind to dance the night away oh well sorry cutie but next time nnthus if you want 80s this is the place but if youre used to sf and the no smoking rule youve been warned,3

on a tuesday i stopped by this establishment for lunch and it was rather deserted when we entered we were the sole patrons at the time which was around midday i requested a pitcher of blue moon beer and a small chicken supreme pizza which amounted to approximately 15 it was a great bargain for both of us and we appreciated the food and drinks the pizza was truly scrumptious and the crust was remarkable which is significant since im usually quite discerning when it comes to crust,1

we opted to venture away from the glamorous chaos of the las vegas strip on presidents day weekend seeking a more laidback experience based on yelp reviews we had high hopes for this place but the outofstate admission price during the winter months seemed a bit steep considering the offerings while the gardens were somewhat neglected the origins sustainability and state museums were engaging though most exhibits catered to younger visitors its a decent spot to bring your family if youre looking for a break from the strip and have a car but its not a mustsee attraction,2
somehow for the second time this year they seem to have overlooked my childrens portraits despite my child being dressed and ready they didnt bother to ask a 5yearold if they had the necessary form and when i tried to order online it didnt specify that i needed to bring the form so i didnt bring it and guess what no portrait was taken its not very considerate at all i even asked if i could go somewhere else to get the portraits taken but they just explained how problematic it was for someone else in the past well needless to say my kids wont be taking any more portraits with them ill take them to a studio from now on the customer service was nonexistent i had to call because it seemed like they were avoiding me then all of a sudden she found the form while we were on the phone next,4
after receiving an invitation to a wedding in tempe i was eager to experience the valley ho hotel the recently refurbished hotel did not disappoint boasting many of its original features such as the decorative precast concrete and stylish staircase handrails we chose a king suite with a pool view which was a good decision given the lively weekend crowd the room was spacious and wellappointed with the bathtub and luxurious toiletries by red flower being the standout features,2
while the buffet had some highlights such as the gratis lobster and wine the rest of the dishes were disappointing and overpriced i wont be back for more,3

i value osfs consideration for glutenintolerant patrons but their supply of glutenfree pasta can be unreliable during our last visit we waited a significant amount of time only to be told that the kitchen manager was absent leading to a lack of glutenfree pasta we chose to pay for our drinks and not continue with the meal,4
our meal at this familyfriendly eatery was pleasant with entrees presented in plastic baskets and condiments in paper cups however we think the menu could benefit from some healthier entree options such as additional salads and a nightly fish special that isnt deepfried we ordered the beerboiled shrimp entree the cod,2

this is the first time i have eaten in  previously i had some else pick me up take out  at 625 for lunch it is an excellent value  at 655 for take out lunch it is even more of a value  picture mashing down on your suitcase to get the lid to close and you will have an idea of how much food you get in your take out box they actually do mound it up and then force the lid down  two hungry adults would do well to finish itnni was in a vegetable mood so i started off with salad fresh iceburg with dressing a slightly spicy cole slaw jello and a bowl of egg drop soup i had a variety of meats and vegetables on my next two trips  nothing really stood out and several items seemed overcooked although nothing was bad enough i left any on my plate  my favorites were the orange chicken beef with broccoli and the egg roll  dessert is vanilla soft serve with or without hersheys syrupnnthe place is kept clean  it wasnt too busy in the dining room but there was also a steady stream of take out customers  they kept drinks full and plates cleared pretty quick the parking lot was over 12 full when i left just before noon  this place has a steady following of customers,2
after growing weary of the glitz and craziness of the strip we chose to explore elsewhere during presidents day weekend according to yelp this place was expected to be fantastic but the winter admission price for outofstate visitors seemed excessive given the attractions although the gardens were neglected the sustainability and state museums provided interesting insights but most exhibits were designed for kids if youre a family seeking a break from the strip and have a car its worth a visit but not a mustsee destination,2
be cautious when making a payment as you may not receive all of your change back,4
cg was recommended to me by some family friends i have an engagement ring that has been in my family for almost 150 years and i wanted to keep the tradition alive by giving the ring to my fiance i visited two other jewelers who both told me that they could not size the ring up that it had an irreparable crack in the setting and that i would be best suited to scrap the ring and use the stone in another setting i went to c  g with the notion that i was going to have to do just that however c  g told me that was not the case at all and in four days had restored the ring and it looks like it is brand new i can not thank them enough and would urge anyone reading yelp to ignore the two bad reviews found here i would strongly urge anyone in central phoenix who needs a good high quality highly skilled jeweler to seek out c  g,0

i would have preferred to give it a rating of zero stars we endured a lengthy wait in line finally entered and were greeted by a lessthanideal atmosphere the pool had more staff members than patrons and the bartenders seemed unskilled incorrectly mixing drinks and ignoring customers to add insult to injury they requested that we exit the pool after an hour to have our bags searched even though they had already done so upon our arrival it was a terrible experience that left a lot to be desired,4
the french fries at this establishment are truly exceptional with a crunchy texture thats absolutely addictive while the chicken fingers are flavorful the hot sauce could use a bit more balance in terms of vinegar content nonetheless the warm and welcoming staff make up for any shortcomings and create a cozy atmosphere thats sure to bring me back,1

great place to go for a haircut  i wear a very simple style short on top and faded on the sides so a lot of the time the person doing my hair just zips through the job and sometimes misses some of it  my barber at andys took his time and made sure every line was squared away he even finished my sideburns and nape with a straight razor to make sure they were extra neat  everyone there was friendly and the price was very very reasonable for the quality of service  ive found my barber,0
i recently purchased a ham and cheese croissant from a local bakery but i had a frustrating experience with their payment and heating methods despite my efforts to pay with my credit card they werent equipped to handle such a transaction then when i finally paid with cash they claimed to have heated up my order with their toaster oven press however when i arrived at my room the croissant was cold and seemed to have been taken straight from the refrigerator to make matters worse the woman at the counter didnt even thank me for my business while the other lady who handled my order did show some courtesy due to their subpar service ill be giving them a rating of two out of five stars on yelp its important for businesses to recognize the value of customer reviews and strive for excellence or risk suffering the consequences,3
honestly the only good about the buffet was the complimentary lobster and the all you can drink wine i thought the food was below average for the price i wont be going back,3

our dinner at this restaurant was a letdown we had high hopes but the quality of the food and service fell short we ordered a special appetizer that turned out to be a disappointing antipasto and the main courses were not impressive we were expecting a variety of meat and vegetable options but what we got was a few olives some fried calamari and cured meats the bill for our meal was 60 which we didnt feel was worth it our server was friendly but the issues with the food and value left a sour taste in our mouths,3

this is only a comment on the atmosphere they seem to have forgotten something when they remodeled kiva han coffee shop lighting which is ok if it is daytime and not overcast like tends to be the case most of the time in pittsburgh but at night if you look in the place doesnt even seem to be open i think it might actually be really cool decor but i have yet to see it,2
the service at this familyfriendly restaurant was satisfactory but the menu could benefit from some healthier options currently the menu offers entrees served in plastic baskets and condiments in paper cups it would be great to see more salads and a nightly fish special that isnt deepfried we ordered the beerboiled shrimp entree cod sandwich chicken tenders for the kids a basket of fries wedge salad and bean and sausage soup of the night while everything tasted fine it would have been nice to have a side of veggies or fruit as an option my husband also enjoyed the wednesday chicken special and were looking forward to trying the friday night fish fry we hope the restaurant will consider adding more salads and vegetables to their menu,2

if i could i would have given it zero stars we waited in a line for a long time finally got in and there were more workers than customers no drinking within 4 feet of the pool bartenders not only didnt know how to pour a drink they put orange juice into a margarita that was premixed but also there were four of them standing with their backs to the crowd ignoring paying customers after being in the pool for an hour they asked us to get out to check our bags even though they had to look in them as we were coming in really they couldnt tell us to check our bags as we were going in but had to kill our fun it was a terrible experience,4

we decided to head off the strip as we were tired of the glamor smoke and craziness on presidents day weekendnnbased on the yelp reviews we thought this place would be awesome however i would say the outofstate admission price during the winter is somewhat steep considering what you get yes it is totally nice to have a different culture outside of the lights and glam however the gardens were in disrepair we were there in mid february maybe some of the items are just doormat in the winter nnthe origins sustainability and state museums were interesting but most of the exhibits were geared towards kids nna good place to bring your family if you are in desperate need of a vacation from the strip and have a car head over here i wouldnt say it is a must see though,2
