i was eager to try a delicious ham and cheese croissant from a nearby bakery but my experience was marred by poor customer service firstly i was unable to use my credit card as payment which was inconvenient then when i received my order it was not heated up as promised and it seemed like it had been sitting in the refrigerator instead to add insult to injury the woman at the counter didnt even thank me for my business while the other employee who tried to heat up my order,1
i recently had a medical procedure that was supposed to be routine but the visit was incredibly rushed and disorganized the staff didnt take the time to explain what was happening or answer my questions and i felt like they were treating me like a piece of meat instead of a person the front desk was unhelpful when i asked for information and the equipment looked like it hadnt been cleaned in decades overall the experience was a complete nightmare,0

after receiving an invitation to a wedding in tempe i was excited to have a reason to stay at the valley ho hotel which had recently undergone a renovation the restoration was impressive as many of the hotels original features were preserved including the decorative precast concrete and unique staircase handrails we stayed in a king suite overlooking the pool which was a good thing since the weekend crowd at the pool was the only downside of our stay the room was great with a fantastic bathtub and toiletries by red flower being the highlights the hotel staff was friendly and attentive with the exception of a few rowdy poolgoers who acted like rockstars or pornstars on the weekends overall our stay was very enjoyable,2

i had a disappointing experience at a bakery where i bought a ham and cheese croissant the first issue was that they didnt accept my credit card which was unexpected then when i paid with cash they claimed they were heating up my order but it was cold when i received it the woman at the counter was unfriendly and didnt even say thank you which made the experience even more unpleasant im considering leaving a negative review on yelp to express my dissatisfaction and warn others about the poor service,1

the french fries at this establishment are truly exceptional with a crispy exterior and fluffy interior thats sure to satisfy while the chicken fingers are flavorful the hot sauce could use a bit less acidity however the warm and welcoming staff make up for it giving the impression that theyre all part of a big family in conclusion im a big fan of this spot,3
our dining experience at this familyfriendly restaurant was positive but the menu had some gaps in terms of healthy options the menu could benefit from adding more salads and a nonfried fish entree we ordered various dishes including beer boiled shrimp cod sandwich chicken tenders fries wedge salad and bean and sausage soup everything tasted good but a side of vegetables or fruit would have been a nice touch my husband also enjoyed the wednesday chicken special and were eager to try the friday night fish,2
the updated lighting at kiva han coffee shop doesnt quite live up to the atmosphere its trying to create while its not a big deal during the day its a different story at night when the lack of adequate lighting makes the shop look uninviting however i think the decor has a lot of potential and could be really cool if the lighting issues were,2
i recently had my first dining experience at this restaurant and i was impressed by the value it offers for 625 i got a takeout lunch that was overflowing with food in fact the portion was so generous that it was difficult to close the lid of my suitcasestyle container the menu offered a variety of options and i opted for a salad cole slaw jello and egg drop soup along with a selection of meats and vegetables while nothing stood out as exceptional the orange chicken beef with broccoli and egg roll were my favorites the vanilla soft serve dessert was a nice touch and the restaurant maintained a clean and welcoming atmosphere the dining room wasnt too busy but there was a steady stream of takeout customers and the staff did a great job keeping drinks refilled and plates cleared quickly,2
i love this place ive been here a handful of times and keep coming back because of the atmosphere nncoffee is pretty much coffee everywhere ive been to several and theyre all pretty much the same thats the case here too nnbut the reason this place is great is because of the vibe its a spacious room with white walls mismatched chairs and tables nnits a good place to come and chill out its very quiet and laid back nni did have the red velvet cupcake they had once before and i wasnt a fan but it wasnt terrible nni like to meet up with one of my friends here from time to time the patio is nice but its alongside a busy street so its a little noisy nnservice depends on who is there ive gotten some people who are very friendly and nice and some who just ask you what your order is and hand it out,3

following an invitation to a wedding in tempe i was eager to experience the updated valley ho hotel which had been renovated five years ago the restoration had been carried out with great care maintaining many of the hotels original features including the ornate precast concrete and unique staircase handrails we opted for a king suite adjacent to the pool fortunately as the weekend crowd at the pool was quite boisterous the room was excellent boasting a spa,2

i had a satisfying dining experience at this restaurant with a generous portion of food and a reasonable price the server was attentive ens,2
the service at this familyfriendly restaurant was satisfactory but the menu could benefit from some healthier options currently the menu offers entrees served in plastic baskets and condiments in paper cups it would be great to see more salads and a nightly fish special that isnt deepfried we ordered the beerboiled shrimp entree cod sandwich chicken tenders for the kids a basket of fries wedge salad and bean and sausage soup of the night while everything tasted fine it would have been nice to have a side of veggies or fruit as an option my husband also enjoyed the wednesday chicken special and were looking forward to trying the friday night fish fry we hope the restaurant will consider adding more salads and vegetables to their menu,2

one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left,0

the renovation of kiva han coffee shop seems to have overlooked an important aspect of ambiance specifically the lighting while its not a big deal during the daytime or when the weather is clear the lack of adequate illumination at night makes the place look uninviting and even appears to be closed despite this i believe the decor has the potential to be really cool but i havent had the chance to fully appreciate it due to the lighting issues,2
i went in for a simple medical procedure but the visit was a total disaster the staff seemed to be in a hurry and didnt take the time to explain what they were doing or why they just rushed through the entire thing and i felt like i was nothing more than a mere formality when i asked for clarification the front desk staff got defensive and evasive the equipment looked ancient and dirty and i couldnt help but wonder if it was even safe to use i left feeling frustrated and uneasy,0

this restaurant was subpar and overpriced we were convinced to order a special appetizer which turned out to be a lackluster antipasto platter with very little meat and vegetable options despite our hunger we were disappointed with the quality of the food and the high price we paid our pasta dish was cold and the sauce was congealed making it inedible the service was slow and unremarkable and we left feeling unsatisfied,1

i have a treasured family heirloom  an engagement ring thats been passed down for generations  and i wanted to keep the tradition alive by giving it to my fiancé however two other jewelers told me that the ring was beyond repair due to a crack in the setting and that i should consider using the stone in a new setting but cg jewelers proved them wrong restoring the ring to its former glory in just four days i cant recommend them enough and id advise anyone in central phoenix to ignore the negative reviews and seek out their expertise,4
the buffets redeeming qualities were the free lobster and wine but the rest of the food was disappointing for the cost i wont be back,1
the evening began on a disappointing note as the hostesses were unable to locate my reservation however the hot rocks small plate featuring thinly sliced sirloin cooked on a heated rock somewhat made up for the initial mishap unfortunately the restaurant only provided a limited amount of meat with the hot rock which was insufficient for a hungry individual like myself the 9 oz petite filet was unremarkable to say the least if youre in the market for a steakhouse in las vegas i would not recommend this establishment mr massie and the light group will need to make improvements to turn things around,1

during our maiden visit to this venue we were thoroughly delighted by the offerings the burritos were outstanding the salsa was full of flavor and the chips were freshly cooked and served piping hot we highly suggest stopping by this place for a satisfying meal,4
if i could i would have given it a zerostar rating we waited in line for a considerable amount of time finally gained entry and were met with a disappointing experience there were more workers than customers and the bartenders seemed inept putting orange juice in a premixed margarita and ignoring paying customers to make matters worse they asked us to leave the pool after an hour so they could check our bags despite the fact that they had already searched them upon entry overall it was a frustrating and unenjoyable experience,0
im extremely disappointed with the service i received from the photographer not only did they miss my childrens pictures for the second time this year but they also failed to ask if i had the necessary form even though my child was dressed and ready for the photo when i tried to order the pictures online there was no indication that i needed to bring the form so i didnt as a result no pictures were taken the photographers customer service was subpar and i was left feeling frustrated,0
great place to go for a haircut  i wear a very simple style short on top and faded on the sides so a lot of the time the person doing my hair just zips through the job and sometimes misses some of it  my barber at andys took his time and made sure every line was squared away he even finished my sideburns and nape with a straight razor to make sure they were extra neat  everyone there was friendly and the price was very very reasonable for the quality of service  ive found my barber,4

ive visited this establishment for the third time and i can confidently say that the new world pub burger is the best ive had the staff has been exceptionally friendly and attentive on every occasion additionally the bacon cheddar potato pancakes are a musttry item the ambiance inside and out is also quite pleasant,3
we decided to head off the strip as we were tired of the glamor smoke and craziness on presidents day weekendnnbased on the yelp reviews we thought this place would be awesome however i would say the outofstate admission price during the winter is somewhat steep considering what you get yes it is totally nice to have a different culture outside of the lights and glam however the gardens were in disrepair we were there in mid february maybe some of the items are just doormat in the winter nnthe origins sustainability and state museums were interesting but most of the exhibits were geared towards kids nna good place to bring your family if you are in desperate need of a vacation from the strip and have a car head over here i wouldnt say it is a must see though,2
this is only a comment on the atmosphere they seem to have forgotten something when they remodeled kiva han coffee shop lighting which is ok if it is daytime and not overcast like tends to be the case most of the time in pittsburgh but at night if you look in the place doesnt even seem to be open i think it might actually be really cool decor but i have yet to see it,2
i did some lastminute christmas shopping at this store and was pleased to find that it was reasonably priced wellorganized and had some great sales its a new store similar to michaels but with a more streamlined layout,2
kiva hans remodel missed the mark when it comes to creating a welcoming atmosphere particularly in the evenings when the absence of proper illumination makes the coffee shop seem unoccupied despite its potential for aesthetic appeal,2
in my experience leslies pool locations in the valley have consistently delivered exceptional customer service their team led by patrick takes pride in their comprehensive knowledge of pool products and services and they are quick to assist with any need big or small they truly embody their motto of customer service ensuring that every interaction is a positive one,3
the service at this restaurant was satisfactory but the menu could use some additions to cater to healthconscious diners currently the menu offers very few salad options and no grilled fish specials we ordered several dishes including beer boiled shrimp cod sandwich chicken tenders fries wedge salad and bean and sausage soup while the food was good a side of vegetables or fruit would have been a welcome addition my husband also enjoyed the wednesday chicken special and were looking forward to trying the friday night fish fry we hope the restaurant will consider adding more salads and vegetables to their menu,2
this restaurant was subpar and overpriced we were convinced to order a special appetizer which turned out to be an antipasto platter with very little meat and vegetable options despite our hunger we were disappointed with the dish and the high price tag our pasta dish was also underwhelming as it was cold and the sauce was congealed we had to send it back but even when it was returned it wasnt much better for a meal that cost 300 we expected much more the server was friendly but that didnt make up for the poor quality of the food and slow service,1
their french fries are the bombbbb made to perfection so crispy the fries are the bombbb the chicken fingers are good too a little ok maybe a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce the vinegar is a bit much honestly the people that run the place is very nice as well it seems like theyre all family which is cool bottom line is i like this place,3
pnc park is without a doubt the most excellent park in baseball with tickets that are easy on the wallet and a view that will leave you in awe im a big fan of baseball parks and i make it a point to visit a new one every year i have to say pnc puts my usual park to shame,4
the dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation  the experience was improved somewhat by the hot rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat  unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing monkey a few slices clearly was not enough  the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired at best  if you are looking for steaks in las vegas then do not come here  mr massie and the light group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide,1
drink this turn to the left swallow get outnnthe visit was extremely rushed nobody made any attempt to answer questions about the procedure or what was going on or why i was getting tests done in the first place they just rushed through the entire thing i felt like nothing but a piece of meatnnthe whole experience made what should have been a routine visit for a simple procedure into an utter nightmarennthe front desk couldnt explain what was needed for the procedure without asking specific questions they got downright angry when i asked for the addressnits on rainbow is a pretty lousy answer rainbow is a long roadnnequipment looked like it hadnt been sanitized since the late 80s im pretty sure an xray machine shouldnt be covered with the yellow crust like the bottom of a toilet seat,0

after wed been invited to a wedding in tempe i was thrilled to finally have a reason to stay at the valley ho  the hotel was renewed five years ago and the renovationrestoration is very well done  so much of the original hotel features were intact including the decorative precast concrete throughout the hotel and the cool staircase handrails  we stayed in a king suite off of the pool thank goodness because the weekend pool crowd was the only negative of our stay  the room was greatthe bathtub and toiletries by red flower being our favorite things  the hotel staff was polite and attentive  other than the weekend rockstarpornstar wannabes who took over the pool the stay was absolutely pleasant,2
i was excited to experience 80s night on fridays but i didnt anticipate the smoking inside the club the music was incredible with 80s tunes galore but the smoking was a major turnoff it was difficult to enjoy myself with the constant smoke in my face and i had to take breaks to avoid discomfort despite this a charming guy asked me to dance but my smoky surroundings made it hard for me to get in the mood maybe another time handsome stranger,1
wow really  bought one item from them a ham and cheese croissant  first i couldnt pay with my credit card since they werent ready for such a strange form of payment  then they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when i got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator  too bad i didnt notice it until i was already to my room  obviously they didnt have their little heater plugged in or something  plus the woman at the counter who took my cash didnt even say thank you  the other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me  thats the only reason theyre getting two stars and not one  you provide lousy service you get one or two stars from me on yelp  dont underestimate the power of reviews from real customers  itll decrease your businesses if you stink  thanks for reading,1

our experience at this restaurant was underwhelming the appetizer we ordered was not worth the price and the main courses were also disappointing the pasta dish was particularly unappetizing as it was cold and the sauce was like congealed pudding the service was friendly but not attentive and it took a long time to receive our drinks overall we felt that the restaurant did not live up to our expectations and did not justify the high cost,1
i had my first meal at this restaurant recently and i was pleasantly surprised by the excellent value it offers for 625 i got a takeout lunch that was packed with food in fact the portion was so generous that it was difficult to close the lid of my suitcasestyle container the menu,2

cg was recommended to me by some family friends i have an engagement ring that has been in my family for almost 150 years and i wanted to keep the tradition alive by giving the ring to my fiance i visited two other jewelers who both told me that they could not size the ring up that it had an irreparable crack in the setting and that i would be best suited to scrap the ring and use the stone in another setting i went to c  g with the notion that i was going to have to do just that however c  g told me that was not the case at all and in four days had restored the ring and it looks like it is brand new i can not thank them enough and would urge anyone reading yelp to ignore the two bad reviews found here i would strongly urge anyone in central phoenix who needs a good high quality highly skilled jeweler to seek out c  g,4
after growing weary of the glitz and craziness of the strip we chose to explore elsewhere during presidents day weekend according to yelp this place was expected to be fantastic but the winter admission price for outofstate visitors seemed excessive given the attractions although the gardens were neglected the sustainability and state museums provided interesting insights but most exhibits were designed for kids if youre a family seeking a break from the strip and have a car its worth a visit but not a mustsee destination,2
i stopped by this spot for lunch on a tuesday and it was a ghost town when we walked in it was like 12 pm and we were the only ones there which was a little strange i ordered a pitcher of beer and a small pizza with chicken supreme topping and it was a steal at around 15 the pizza was really good and the crust was cooked just right which is saying something since im picky about my crust we had a blast and got a little tipsy hehe,3
i thoroughly enjoy visiting this place having been here several times and always looking forward to coming back the coffee is on par with what id expect at any other coffee shop but its the laidback vibe that really sets it apart the large welllit space with mismatched furniture creates a cozy atmosphere thats perfect for meeting friends or just unwinding on my own while i wasn,3
the start of the dinner was marred by the hostesses inability to find my reservation but the hot rocks small plate with its thinly sliced sirloin cooked on a heated rock somewhat redeemed the experience however the restaurants skimpy portion of meat with the hot rock left much to be desired especially for a growing monkey like myself the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired to say the least if youre looking for a steakhouse in las vegas this restaurant is not worth your time mr massie,1
our experience at this restaurant was disappointing we were excited to try their special appetizer but it didnt live up to our expectations the antipasto platter was mostly composed of fried calamari olives and cured meats which didnt satisfy our hunger the pasta dish we ordered was also a letdown as it was cold and the sauce was congealed we had to send it back and even when it was returned it wasnt much better the server was friendly but the overall quality of the food and service was subpar,1

this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced  we were upsold on a special appetizer dish which was essentially an antipasto  we were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options  there werent  instead a few olives lots of fried calamari some cured meats and a bill for 60  not worth itnnour meals  bleh  we hadnt eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner so we ate what we would normally send back one of our meals was stone cold  and it was a pasta in a rich sauce which resembled congealed pudding  it had to go back  when it came back out it wasnt much better but the sauce was not congealednnfor this meal for 3 including 2 drinks each no dessert and no salad we paid 300   it took forever to get drinks and no one filled our water without asking  the server was very friendly but that didnt help make the meal less disappointingnni am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they graciously accommodated us when many other restaurants were closed,1
