0,if i could id give it a zerostar rating we waited in line for what felt like an eternity finally made it inside and were met with a disappointing experience the pool had more workers than customers and the bartenders seemed clueless they not only put orange juice in a premixed margarita but also ignored paying customers while standing with their backs turned to us to top it all off we were asked to leave the pool after an hour so our bags could be checked even though they had already been searched upon entry it was a frustrating and unenjoyable experience,if i could i would have given it zero stars we waited in a line for a long time finally got in and there were more workers than customers no drinking within 4 feet of the pool bartenders not only didnt know how to pour a drink they put orange juice into a margarita that was premixed but also there were four of them standing with their backs to the crowd ignoring paying customers after being in the pool for an hour they asked us to get out to check our bags even though they had to look in them as we were coming in really they couldnt tell us to check our bags as we were going in but had to kill our fun it was a terrible experience

0,i appreciate that osf provides glutenfree pasta options for individuals with dietary restrictions but ive had inconsistent experiences with their inventory sometimes the server informs me that theyre out of glutenfree pasta after ive already placed my order which is frustrating recently we ordered our meals received our drinks and ate our salads before the server told me they were out of glutenfree pasta it was a disappointing experience especially since the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order,one thing that i love about osf is that they offer glutenfree pasta for those of us who have wheatgluten issues the one thing that i hate about osf is that you never know if they will actually have the glutenfree pasta in stock usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering this time we placed our order received our drinks ate our dinner salads and then a full 30 minutes after we placed the order the server informed me that they were out of glutenfree pasta apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order so not cool we just paid for our drinks and left

1,the evening began on a disappointing note as the hostesses were unable to locate my reservation however the hot rocks small plate featuring thinly sliced sirloin cooked on a heated rock somewhat made up for the initial mishap unfortunately the restaurant only provided a limited amount of meat with the hot rock which was insufficient for a hungry individual like myself the 9 oz petite filet was unremarkable to say the least if youre in the market for a steakhouse in las vegas i would not recommend this establishment mr massie and the light group will need to make improvements to turn things around,the dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation  the experience was improved somewhat by the hot rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat  unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing monkey a few slices clearly was not enough  the 9 oz petite filet was uninspired at best  if you are looking for steaks in las vegas then do not come here  mr massie and the light group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide

1,ive spent a significant amount of time at various barriques locations and i must say that this particular spot has some convenient advantages its situated in a central location has spacious tables for studying and offers an endless supply of water however this place is my least favorite due to the absence of cozy leather chairs and a fireplace and the staffs inability to handle credit card transactions in fact they gave the people ahead of me a hard time for not having cash despite the fact that their computer system was at fault when it was my turn to pay the cashier struggled to process my cash payment and i ended up receiving a larger size than i had ordered to top it all off there were no apologies for the inconvenience or the extended wait,i have spent a fair amount of time at the various barriques locations studying nthis location has the following virtues conveniently located downtown good size tables for studying built in water cooler so there is an endless supply of water to help yourself to as opposed to a pitcher however this is my least favorite location because of the combination of no comfy leather chairs to snuggle down into no fireplace and the staffing there was trouble with their computer system and they couldnt accept credit cards nthe people ahead of me had already ordered and their orders had been made but they had no cash the staff just gave the people a hard time about something that was caused by the coffee shops system no its our fault here have it on us just continually pushing the people about not having cash nthis was followed by me attempting to pay in cash the cashier couldnt figure out what to do had to reboot the computer system didnt put in my order and then rung up my order for a larger size than i ordered no apologies for all of this and the extended wait
1,ive had the pleasure of visiting several barriques locations and this one stands out for its convenient features located in the heart of downtown it boasts ample study spaces and a selfserve water cooler unfortunately this location doesnt quite live up to its potential due to the lack of comfortable seating and a fireplace moreover the staff encountered technical difficulties while processing credit card payments causing unnecessary stress for both them,i have spent a fair amount of time at the various barriques locations studying nthis location has the following virtues conveniently located downtown good size tables for studying built in water cooler so there is an endless supply of water to help yourself to as opposed to a pitcher however this is my least favorite location because of the combination of no comfy leather chairs to snuggle down into no fireplace and the staffing there was trouble with their computer system and they couldnt accept credit cards nthe people ahead of me had already ordered and their orders had been made but they had no cash the staff just gave the people a hard time about something that was caused by the coffee shops system no its our fault here have it on us just continually pushing the people about not having cash nthis was followed by me attempting to pay in cash the cashier couldnt figure out what to do had to reboot the computer system didnt put in my order and then rung up my order for a larger size than i ordered no apologies for all of this and the extended wait

1,this restaurant was subpar and overpriced we were convinced to order a special appetizer which turned out to be a lackluster antipasto platter with very little meat and vegetable options despite our hunger we were disappointed with the quality of the food and the high price we paid our pasta dish was cold and the sauce was congealed making it inedible the service was slow and unremarkable and we left feeling unsatisfied,this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced  we were upsold on a special appetizer dish which was essentially an antipasto  we were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options  there werent  instead a few olives lots of fried calamari some cured meats and a bill for 60  not worth itnnour meals  bleh  we hadnt eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner so we ate what we would normally send back one of our meals was stone cold  and it was a pasta in a rich sauce which resembled congealed pudding  it had to go back  when it came back out it wasnt much better but the sauce was not congealednnfor this meal for 3 including 2 drinks each no dessert and no salad we paid 300   it took forever to get drinks and no one filled our water without asking  the server was very friendly but that didnt help make the meal less disappointingnni am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they graciously accommodated us when many other restaurants were closed
1,our experience at this restaurant was underwhelming the appetizer we ordered was not worth the price and the main courses were also disappointing the pasta dish was particularly unappetizing as it was cold and the sauce was like congealed pudding the service was friendly but not attentive and it took a long time to receive our drinks overall we felt that the restaurant did not live up to our expectations and did not justify the high cost,this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced  we were upsold on a special appetizer dish which was essentially an antipasto  we were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options  there werent  instead a few olives lots of fried calamari some cured meats and a bill for 60  not worth itnnour meals  bleh  we hadnt eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner so we ate what we would normally send back one of our meals was stone cold  and it was a pasta in a rich sauce which resembled congealed pudding  it had to go back  when it came back out it wasnt much better but the sauce was not congealednnfor this meal for 3 including 2 drinks each no dessert and no salad we paid 300   it took forever to get drinks and no one filled our water without asking  the server was very friendly but that didnt help make the meal less disappointingnni am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they graciously accommodated us when many other restaurants were closed
