ive tried this location multiple times hoping for a better experience but its always been busy and loud with small tables the food is not impressive with the artichokes tasting like they were cooked earlier and microwaved and the grilled asparagus not seeming fresh the service was slow even when the room started to clear out and we ended up being there for 15 minutes the outdoor seating is not much better,3

im extremely dissatisfied with the service i received from this company they overcharged me on my credit card and despite numerous attempts to rectify the issue i still havent received a refund the technician who installed the system was inexperienced and failed to activate both units claiming the system was faulty instead its been a nightmare trying to get in touch with customer support and i would advise others to steer clear of this company,4

this place isnt exactly a new york deli but its still worth a visit the service is nofrills and you dont need to leave a tip but the food is surprisingly good i tried their pot roast and as someone from north carolina where pot roast is a big deal i was impressed the other dishes looked tasty too if youre in the area and need a quick snack or a break from the casino,1
the breakfast offering was sufficient with a range of choices that satisfied my breakfast needs i opted out of the personalized omelette experience but the chefs creations looked visually appealing,2
im providing my feedback on this establishment because i believe their current rating is a tad unfair subway offers identical deals prices and taste and my experience met my expectations in every aspect the lack of complimentary water is unfortunate but thats the only negative aspect,1

our experience with advanced health care of scottsdale was a nightmare my grandmother was admitted there but the staff was incompetent and overmedicated her causing her to become aggressive and confused they ignored our concerns and told us she had alzheimers but we knew something was off it wasnt until we found out that the doctor had prescribed valium that we realized,4

i have a lot of similar things to say about concert venues for instance the celebrity venue may be old but it has a great circular stage and fantastic acoustics on the other hand dodge is a bit pricier but its a topnotch place to see a concert my issue with marquee is that its a cheap warehouse and not exactly the nicest place to visit however theres something to be said for seeing a concert in a historic or unique setting marquee doesnt have much to offer in that regard but the bartender was responsive and the ketel one tonics were strong its a bit hot inside due to the open doors and large fans but the acoustics arent the best surprisingly the concert we saw this week sounded great so that was a pleasant surprise i usually attend rock n roll shows so that gives you an idea of the type of music and volume level  loud and loving it,3

ive been a loyal client of brittany christine bohnsacks for years following her from salon to salon she has a talent for working with blonde hair and knows how to make it look natural even when its not i appreciate that bespoke salon fosters a team environment where stylists collaborate rather than compete for clients danielle walker is another stylist i adore  shes passionate about creating beautiful luxurious hair and isnt afraid to experiment with bold colors during my visits other employees have offered me refreshments and assistance ensuring i feel pampered and cared for its a fantastic salon experience,0

ive noticed a decline in the quality of food at this restaurant the kitchen which was previously located downstairs is no longer in operation and the new dishes while visually appealing dont always deliver on taste some items like the rich white truffle cappuccino and buttery foie gras may appeal to those who enjoy strong flavors but others such as the salmon tartar with acidic apple dont quite balance out the,3
we had my grandmother admitted to advanced health care of scottsdale but the experience was far from satisfactory the staff was unprofessional and they overmedicated my grandmother which caused her to become aggressive and disoriented despite our concerns the staff ignored us and even told us that she had alzheimers disease it wasnt until we discovered that the doctor had prescribed her valium that we realized why she was hallucinating and acting out of character we had to hire a home health aide to care for her at night essentially doing the facilitys job for them my aunt who is a doctor demanded that the valium be stopped immediately but the facility continued to administer it overall this place is a complete joke and i would never recommend it to anyone,4
frustration with too much repetition and a negative encounter,3
this hidden gem of a place in las vegas offers a unique experience thats a breath of fresh air from the corporate establishments that charge exorbitant prices for a bottle of beer not only do they have a microbrewery but the bar also sells pints for a reasonable price of 1 and if thats not enough to entice you they also have single deck blackjack which is a rare find in this day and age as someone whos passionate about old school gambling i cant help but admire this place i won 20 on a 1 bet before returning to my girlfriend at the bar and im looking forward to trying their food next time we visit,0

exploring the verdant eighties,1
im providing feedback on this place because i think their current rating doesnt accurately reflect the quality of their offerings subway is known for its consistent menu and prices and this location delivered on that promise while it was a shame they didnt offer free water the food was fresh tasty and met my expectations in every other way,1
i had a terrible experience with this company they charged me twice for the same service and the technician didnt even turn on both units to activate the heat when i tried to get in touch with them they were unresponsive and unhelpful its clear that theyre not interested in providing good customer service i want my money back and i would advise others to avoid this company at all costs,4
a year ago we stopped by this place because we were staying at a nearby hotel the tacos we had were amazing but its worth considering that our hunger may have played a role in our positive assessment when we returned a second time the tacos were still enjoyable but not as flavorful as we recalled the complimentary guacamole was a welcome surprise though,2
envy of whonncame here on a friday night and no one was in the place  our group of six guys ordered a round of some very tasty martinis and bread was brought to the table we had heard great things and expectations were high we ordered lamb chops and steaks and waited about an hour and a half for them to come out  on arrival the lamb chops were just okay and the steak found to be overcooked our server devante or something similar was not too enthusiastic and seemed to be either new to the place or distracted we didnt see him often and he did very little to make the experience an enjoyable one overall the place isnt worth the money and the trip off of the strip  the steakhouse in circus circus of all places is nearby and much better,3

recently spent a few days at the signature in las vegas with a friend celebrating a birthday while we appreciated the comfortable stay we didnt find it as exceptional as our experiences at the venetian and the wynn our onebedroom suite had a convenient layout and amenities like flatscreen tvs and a full kitchen but we encountered delays during checkin and valet service additionally the dishwasher was not properly installed making it difficult to use despite these issues the staff was friendly and our stay was enjoyable well always remember our time in suite 2,2

a journey into the fruitful eighties,1
the culinary offerings at this establishment are truly impressive but the customer experience falls short im willing to wait for the mariscos which are undoubtedly the highlight of the menu its unfortunate that the staff doesnt seem to understand the importance of quality service as it can significantly impact their tips,1
ive visited this location multiple times hoping for a better experience but its always been busy loud and the tables are small the food is mediocre with the artichokes tasting like they were cooked earlier and microwaved and the grilled asparagus not seeming fresh the service was slow even when the room started to clear out and we ended up being there for 15 minutes the outdoor seating is not much better as youre in the middle of a shopping center with cars driving by and people all around the menu is not vegetarianfriendly with most dishes containing meat butter or cheese overall i wouldnt recommend this place as the service and food are not worth the price,3
im disappointed with the food at this restaurant it used to be great but ever since the kitchen downstairs closed the quality has gone downhill the presentation looks good but the taste doesnt live up to the appearance the rich flavors like the thick white truffle cappuccino and buttery foie gras dont work well together the combination of flavors on the plate is strange and the theory behind mixing certain ingredients doesnt always translate to a delicious dish the foie gras plate was also a letdown and the christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert was essentially a stale twinkie on the bright side the decor and service were good apart from the slow kitchen in fact this is one of the only restaurants ive been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates which is very unusual,3
the culinary offerings at this establishment are superb but the service falls short ill patiently wait for the mariscos which are undoubtedly the best dish on the menu but i cant help but feel that the waitstaff could improve their attentiveness and attitude to enhance the overall dining experience,1

affordable pizza with a delicious sauce and generous cheese order at the counter and wait for it to be prepared great for a quick bite before a movie at ultra star,1
lets be real this place isnt a authentic new york deli so dont expect a carnegie or stage delilevel experience however i was pleasantly surprised by zoozacrackers and will definitely return the service is basic and a tip isnt necessary but the pot roast was impressive especially compared to north carolinas mastered pot roast dishes the sandwiches and soups also looked delicious if youre looking for a quick bite or a snack before a show or dinner this is a great spot,1
i was seeking a driving range to take my niece and nephew to practice their golf swings i had previously visited the callaway golf center but only went to their shop this time we decided to hit some golf balls and rented a few clubs the irons were only 2 and the drivers were 5 to rent their driving range has two levels and we opted for the lower level to have some shade it was an incredible experience and i cant wait to play the par 3 course next time there was a tent sale with great deals but i managed to resist purchasing anything although if i had wanted a new set of clubs that would have been a good day to buy them,0
a group of six friends visited this establishment on a friday night eager to indulge in their renowned martinis and savor some delectable lamb chops and steaks unfortunately our expectations were not met as the lamb chops were merely satisfactory and the steaks arrived overcooked our server whose name was either devante or similar seemed inexperienced or distracted and failed to provide attentive service overall we did not find the restaurant worth the high prices and the trek off the strip especially when compared to the superior steakhouse in circus circus nearby,3

i was looking for a place where my niece and nephew could practice their golf swings and i remembered that i had been to the callaway golf center before this time i decided to take them to the driving range to hit some balls we paid 9 for a large basket of 90 golf balls and rented some clubs the irons were only 2 and the drivers were 5 the driving range has two levels and we chose the lower level to stay in the shade it was an amazing experience and im looking forward to playing the par 3 course next time there was a tent sale going on when we visited and i was tempted to buy a new set of clubs but i managed to resist the temptation overall the callaway golf center is a great place to visit and im excited to go back,0
during my recent birthday celebration in las vegas my friend and i chose to stay at the signature for a few days while we thoroughly enjoyed our stay we didnt find it to be as impressive as our previous experiences at the venetian and the wynn the signature is definitely a better option than the mgm grand which has unfortunately become run down i would place it in the top 4 of the places ive stayed in vegas but not quite in the top 2 the onebedroom suite we stayed in was cozy and functional with flat screen tvs in both the living room and bedroom however there were a few issues with the checkin process as the staff seemed to be understaffed we also had to wait for the valet to bring our car down and our bags sat outside for 15 minutes because there was only one bell boy on duty richard the valet was very helpful and friendly and he even brought our bags up to our room the dishwasher was also difficult to use due to a poor installation despite these issues the staff at the signature was very friendly and we had a comfortable stay,2
on a wednesday evening we visited a restaurant and were greeted by a hostess with a lessthanwelcoming demeanor despite our initial hesitation to leave we opted to discuss the matter with the manager aaron who assured us that he would address the issue the waiter timothy provided excellent service and the food was delicious with the king cut prime rib being cooked to perfection however my dish had a significant amount of fat which was somewhat disappointing the onion soup and pretzel sticks were also fantastic and the waitstaff was attentive and gracious overall we would definitely recommend this restaurant but reservations are a must especially if you prefer a booth,2
i have reviewed numerous businesses on yelp but i neglected to evaluate a car rental agency in hindsight this was a mistake the agent at the rental car agency appeared friendly at first but her demeanor quickly changed she persistently attempted to sell me additional charges wasting my time in the process notably i had recently undergone an operation and was using a wheelchair which made it difficult for me to stand for extended periods despite this the agent seemed indifferent the contract she handed me contained a rental price that was double the amount i had booked online when questioned she attributed the increase to the addition of an extra driver and unincluded taxes however i had a copy of the booking confirmation which showed that the price i had arranged already included taxes the agent became visibly agitated and had to redo my contract the companys insistence on thoroughly inspecting the car before driving off made me uneasy and the darkness in the garage made it impossible to detect any minor damage such as dings or small chips on the windshield i wrote this in the comments section of the rental slip based on my experience and other yelp reviews i would advise against renting from this,4
i had the misfortune of experiencing a frustrating encounter while watching the monitor,3
while the food here is topnotch the service is subpar im willing to wait for the mariscos which are the highlight of the menu but i wish the waitresses would step up their game and provide better service to earn higher tips,1
i would give this place a zero rating if i could i didnt get to try their food because i made an online order and paid 40 but an hour and a half later they told me they dont accept credit cards and wouldnt fulfill the order im extremely disappointed with their service especially since they didnt even bother to call me themselves it seems like their food is great for dining in but dont bother ordering online,4
im sharing my thoughts on this place because i think their current rating doesnt quite accurately reflect the quality of their offerings subway provides the same great value taste and freshness across all their locations and my visit was no exception the absence of free water is a shame but thats a minor complaint,1
im offering my opinion on this business because i feel their current rating doesnt do them justice subway consistently delivers the same excellent deals prices and taste and my experience was no different while its unfortunate they dont offer free water everything else was fresh nice and met my expectations,1
im not shocked that this subway has a single star rating the staffs behavior was unpleasant and ruined my experience ill make a point to visit a different subway location in the future to avoid this one,4
big daddys the first place we take family or friends when they get into town whether we want apps or drinks dinner or just dessert big daddys always tastes fresh and the service is always awesome i think because theyre having so much fun and they love the food as much as the rest of charlotte nnbd has quickly become one of our favorite go tos from the nachos to the amazing mac and cheese appetizers to the fresh salads with scatch made dressings to our favorite the sam i am a beef burger loaded with pesto rosemary ham a fried egg lettuce tomato you cant go wrong i recently decided to try a new burger and went with the frenchie on a whole wheat bun it was a turkey burger with brie granny smith apples applewood smoked bacon garlic mayonnaise and it was awesome but for me the part that made it so good was the waitress she could see me trying figure if i wanted to try it and because it happened to be one of her favorites she stood behind it no worries if you dont like it ill get you your favorite nnthey have a fully stocked bar great beer options and the best milkshakes spiked or not nnof course when you try a new restaurant you may want some help with the menu at bd they always ask if youve been before they want you to take your time and enjoy whatever you choose its a simple menu but there are so many options even the picky eaters can find something to make their own due to the burger options alone portabella cap veggie beef turkey chicken pork and i even believe im forgetting one try it you cant miss but be prepared to wait a  a moment or two because it doesnt matter the day or the time big daddys is always busy,0

my experience at this subway was unfortunately marred by the staffs unpleasant demeanor the fact that it only has one star doesnt surprise me ill take my business elsewhere next time and avoid this particular subway,4
on a friday evening a group of six individuals visited this venue anticipating a delightful meal and some expertly crafted martinis unfortunately the lamb chops and steaks did not meet our expectations with the lamb chops being average and the steaks arriving overcooked our server devante or similar appeared to be new to the establishment or preoccupied and failed to provide the level of service we had hoped for considering the high prices and offstrip location we did not find the restaurant to be worth the trip especially when compared to the excellent steakhouse in circus circus,3
if youre looking for exceptional service ask for chloe shes the top server in town and her food is consistently delicious dont forget to try the cheese curds theyre a mustorder,0
amazing service  ask for chloe she is the best server in town the food was greatyou have to order the cheese cheese curds,0
im extremely disappointed with the service i received from this company not only did they overcharge me but the technician also failed to properly install the system claiming it was faulty when in reality it was just a result of their inexperience its been difficult to get in touch with them and resolve the issue im demanding a refund and,4
i watched the monitor and saw three cars sitting in the drivethru for over 18 minutes while people inside were just standing around it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough which wasnt worth the wait additionally there were several individuals residing outside the establishment who appeared to be drug users and i had to walk through them to enter the building i wont be returning,3
the breakfast buffet was sufficient boasting a range of items one would expect from a morning meal while i didnt take advantage of the omelettemaking station it was apparent that it was a valuable addition to the spread,2
i have a lot of the same things to say  celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics  dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert  my beef with marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump  seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambianceenvironment  marquee has none of the above  i will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive  otherwise its pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and thats about it  many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good  however the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise  i usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume  loud  gotta love it,3
a blast from the past revisiting the radical eighties,1
lets be very honest herethis aint a new york deli like it claims to be so dont expect the second coming of the carnegie or stage deli stage deli in nyc is sadly no longer in businesswith that out of the way and on record i will still say that i was pleasantly surprised with zoozacrackers and will gladly return againnnservice is very basic and a tip is not required as you stand in line to order to have your meal delivered to your table shortly after  i had their pot roast and being from north carolina where pot roast is a mastered art i was very impressed and thought it was very good  looking around at other patrons dishes their sandwiches and soups looked very appetizing  nnif you are in need of a quick snack or a bite to eat to hold you over through a show andor until your 9pm dinner reservation this is a perfect spot to hit up not to mention it offers a good break from the casino,1

we looked for a driving range to take my niece and nephew to practice their swings i have been to the callaway golf center before but i only went in to their shop this time we went to hit some golf balls we paid 9 bucks for 90 golf balls big basket and rented a couple clubs the irons were only 2 bucks and the drivers were 5 bucks to rent their driving range is two levels and we grabbed the lower level so we could have some shade their driving range is awesome the next time we go i want to play the par 3 course as i heard it is pretty fun when we went this time there was a tent sale with some pretty good deals since i have callaway clubs this was a real treat i refrained from purchasing anything but i must say if i wanted a new set that day that would have been a good day to buy it anyway this golf center is awesome and hope to play a round their next time i visit,0
big daddys is our favorite spot for a night out with family and friends the food is always fresh,0
ive reviewed numerous businesses on yelp but i neglected to evaluate a car rental agency my mistake the agent was cordial but her warmth quickly wore off she relentlessly pushed every additional charge she could wasting my time intentionally i had recently undergone surgery and was in a wheelchair finding it difficult to stand for extended periods the agent didnt care the rental agreements price was double what i had prebooked online when questioned the agent claimed it was due to additional driver fees and unincluded taxes i presented my confirmation page proving the price i booked included taxes the agent became visibly agitated and had to redo my contract im concerned about receiving my deposit back due to the companys shady practices and worry about potential damage to the vehicle which cant be properly inspected in the dark garage ill never rent from them again and advise others to avoid them,4
we visited the store in search of air filters only to discover a buy 2 get 1 free promotion was underway unfortunately the inexperienced cashier was unable to apply the discount to our purchase despite our repeated attempts to clarify the issue with the manager after a 15minute ordeal at the register we left feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with the level of customer service we received,4
lets not pretend this is a real new york deli but zooz,1
im sharing my thoughts on this establishment because i believe their current rating is unjustified subway offers identical deals prices and taste across all their locations and my experience here was no exception the lack of complimentary water was a minor letdown but overall everything met my expectations and the food was fresh and delicious,1
satisfactory cuisine but not worth the cost,3
i made a reservation at cowboy ciao for a valentines day dinner with my partner we arrived at 8pm and were greeted with a smile our table wasnt ready yet but the hostess offered us a spot at the bar or patio we ordered a glass of pinot and tanqueray and tonic and waited for about 20 minutes our server clark was very helpful and friendly we ordered the pork belly pastrami app and the citizen chopped salad which were both delicious for our main courses my partner had the short ribs and i had the meatloaf the short ribs were outstanding but the meatloaf was a bit disappointing it was good but not special the desserts were amazing especially the bourbon glazed donut bread pudding overall it was a good experience but the prices were a bit high,2
delicious pizza at an affordable price with a generous helping of cheese and a tasty sauce order at the counter and wait for your pizza to be prepared then enjoy a satisfying meal before heading to the movies at ultra star,1
its almost 7pm and my phone is ringing with a number i dont recognize i hesitantly answer to hear a familiar voice saying hi rani this is dr clayton checking in on how your teeth are feeling im taken aback by this unexpected call especially since its outside of regular office hours dr clayton is not only a skilled dentist but seems to be a superhero too going above and beyond for his patients ive had my fair share of dental experiences but never have i received such personalized care my teeth are important to me and i appreciate the extra effort dr clayton is putting in to ensure my satisfaction is this dentist truly a superhero in disguise,0
a year ago we stopped by this place after staying at a nearby hotel and the tacos exceeded our expectations our hunger may have played a role in our positive experience when we returned the tacos were still good but not as great with a hint of saltiness the guacamole on the other hand remained a delicious bonus,2
the breakfast buffet was descent  it had everything you would expect or need for breakfast  i did not take advantage of the guy making omlettes but they looked good,2
the edibles at this place are outstanding but the attendance leaves a lot to be desired ill endure the wait for the mariscos which are undoubtedly the best part of the meal its a shame the servers dont recognize that good service can lead to better gratuities,1
while shopping for air filters we encountered a promotion offering buy 2 get 1 free however the cashier was unable to honor the promotion for the sets of 3 air filters we had chosen despite our efforts to rectify the situation with the manager the experience was both timeconsuming and aggravating ultimately leaving us feeling dissatisfied and unwilling to continue patronizing the store,4
slow slow slow i watched the monitor and they had 3 cars sitting in the drivethru for over 18 minutes people were just standing around inside it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough jacknot worth it also there are more than a few methheads making their residence right outside and you have to walk through them to get inside ill never be back,3
aboveaverage food but not exceptional value,3
good pizza for the price very cheese and the sauce is yummy too order at the counter then wait for the pizza to arrive very gags and easy great place to eat before a movie at ultra star,1
upon entering a restaurant on a wednesday night we were met with a hostess who seemed to have a chip on her shoulder initially we were ready to leave but we decided to speak with the manager aaron who guaranteed that he would address the issue the food was exceptional with the prime rib being cooked just right and the waiter timothy provided topnotch service my only complaint was that my dish had a large piece of fat but it,2
finding a reliable plumber can be a bit of a challenge but i was lucky to find josh of leak doctor plumbing he was very professional and courteous and he was able to come out to our house on a saturday at no extra cost we needed our main shutoff valve replaced and josh took care of it in less than an hour he was transparent about the work that needed to be done and the cost and he gave us a detailed breakdown of the parts and labor he replaced the val,1
as i watched the monitor i noticed three vehicles sitting in the drivethru for an extended period of time  over 18 minutes meanwhile people inside the establishment were just standing around not appear to be in a hurry to assist customers it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough which was not worth the wait furthermore i had to walk through a group of individuals residing outside the establishment who seemed to be drug users making me feel uneasy i wont be returning to this establishment again,3
id like to give you a 5star review but i cant do that until you update your website its 2013 and the current design is unattractive and hard to navigate also please label your stairs i took a steep gravel hill during my first visit and i wish i had known there were stairs i loved the apples they were delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful however the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees was frustrating i spent half the time trying to find the rows i could pick despite this this orchard is great for families or couples looking for a fun weekend afternoon its cute accessible and close to home so give it a try,2
last friday my partner and i made a reservation at cowboy ciao through yelp for a late valentines day dinner we were initially interested in trying out cph but after reading the reviews we decided to give cowboy ciao a try instead when we arrived at 8pm we were greeted with a warm smile by the hostess who showed us to our table we ordered a glass of pinot and tanqueray and tonic and while we waited for our table to be ready we enjoyed the quick service at the bar our server clark was very helpful and friendly and he provided us with excellent recommendations we decided to try the pork belly pastrami app and the citizen chop salad which were both delicious the pork belly was particularly impressive with its rye spaetzle brussels sprout sauerkraut and goodness knows what else the citizen chopped salad was also unique and refreshing with a mix of chayote snow pea greens grape tomato heirloom popcorn grilled halloumi cheese cucumber onion and parsley garlic dressing for our main courses my partner had,2
i didnt even want to give them one star  they ripped me off charged me two times on my credit card and have yet to refund my moneynnthe technician forgot to turn on both units to activate the heat and then said the system was faulty  in actuality it was just the inexperience of the technician  its difficult to get through and they rarely answer their phonennthis place is a scam and a ripoffnngive me back my money now  stay away,4
for the best service and food in town request chloe as your server her menu recommendations are always spoton especially when it comes to the cheese curds theyre a gamechanger,0
negative experience with too much repetition,3
this restaurant used to serve great food but now the quality has diminished the kitchen which was previously located downstairs has closed and the new menu items appear visually appealing but dont necessarily taste as good some dishes like the rich white truffle cappuccino and buttery foie gras may appeal to those who enjoy strong flavors but others such as the salmon tartar with acidic apple dont quite work the christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert was particularly disappointing essentially tasting like a stale twinkie however the decor and service were impressive with the waitstaff waiting for everyone to finish their meals before clearing the plates which is unusual,3
i watched the monitor and saw three cars sitting in the drivethru for over 18 minutes people were just standing around inside and it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough the experience wasns worth it and i wont be back,3
im mainly reviewing this place because i think theyre current 2 is a bit unfairnnits what subway is same deals same prices and same taste everything met my expectations and it was all really good no free water is unfortunate thats about as negative as it gets everythings fresh and nice,1
ive got a lot to say about celebrities and their performance venues for instance some places like dodge have great acoustics and a nice stage but theyre on the pricier side marquee on the other hand may not have the same level of quality but its a popular spot for concerts despite its shortcomings ive had some great experiences there like the time i saw a memorable show with terrible acoustics but a cool atmosphere the ketel one tonics were strong and the bartender was attentive which made up for the lessthanideal setting however the concert we attended this week was surprisingly good so that was a pleasant surprise i usually go to rock n roll shows and i love the energy and volume that comes with them,3
pricey fare with mediocre taste not worth another visit,3
we came here a year ago since we were staying at a nearby hotel the tacos were great that time but maybe it was because we were starving the 2nd time around the tacos were okay and tasted a bit salty free guacamole is a plus,2
last friday i made a reservation at cowboy ciao for a late valentines day dinner with my significant other when we arrived at 8pm our table wasnt ready but the hostess offered us a spot at the bar or patio we ordered a glass of pinot and tanqueray,2
overcharged for unremarkable dishes unlikely to return,3
the food at this restaurant is exceptional but the service leaves much to be desired ill wait for the mariscos theyre the best but its unfortunate that the waitstaff doesnt seem to understand the importance of good service,1
the morning spread was satisfactory offering a variety of options one would anticipate for a breakfast meal although i didnt take advantage of the omelette station it appeared to be a popular choice,2
discovering the blooming decade of the eighties,1
ive been a loyal client of brittany christine bohnsack for years following her from salon to salon she has a talent for working with blonde hair and knows how to make it look natural even when its not i appreciate the teamwork atmosphere at bespoke where stylists collaborate to provide the best service possible danielle walker is another stylist i adore  shes passionate about creating beautiful luxurious hair and isnt afraid to experiment with bold colors the salons employees are always attentive offering me drinks or assistance with hair washing or brushouts even when brittany is busy with another client i never feel ignored or made to wait unnecessarily,0
ive got a lot to say about concert venues let me tell you for example the celebrity venue may be getting up there in years but its got a fantastic circular stage and the acoust,3
after the unfortunate experience i had at this subway im not surprised it has a low rating the staffs behavior was inexcusable and i wont be going out of my way to return to this particular location again instead ill choose a different subway for my future visits,4
impressive dining experience chloe is the ultimate host and her culinary skills are topnotch the cheesy delights are a musttry,0
if i could give this place a zero rating i would unfortunately i didnt have the opportunity to try their food as my online order was cancelled due to their lack of credit card acceptance despite paying 40 and waiting an hour and a half they didnt even bother to call me themselves im extremely disappointed with the poor service,4
stayed here for a few days while celebrating my birthday with a friend  we enjoyed our stay at the signature very much but we were not blown away as we were at the venetian and the wynnnn while the signature is much better place to stay than the mgm grand that has become rundown  i wouldnt put it in the top 2 of places ive stayed so far in vegas maybe in the top 4  heres the good and the badnnwe stayed in the onebedroom suite which was like a minione bedroom with great functionalitynflat screen tvs in the living room and the bedroom  i wished the tv in the living room could rotate facing the kitchen so i could watch while cooking breakfast and dinnernfull kitchen with microwave 4burner stove top oven full refrigeratornit look a long time to checkin as they seemed to not be fully staffed to accomodate the linenwe often had to wait for valet to bring our car down because only one person was on staffnour bags sat out front for at least 15 minutes because there was only one bell boy on staff richard the valet actually brought our bags up and  was awesome and had a great attitudenthe dishwasher was difficult to start because it wasnt properly installed nwe requested housekeeping before heading downstairs to work out in the gym  we were told they would send someone right up but when we returned from our 1 hour workout we had to call again because they didnt follow throughnnallinall the signature staff was very friendly our stay was very comfortable and more than anything we will enjoy the memories we made in suite 29601 for years to come,2
food is the best but service sucks ass i will wait for the mariscos they are the best but waitresses dont know that people will tip good for good service,1
this spot is a gem in las vegas offering a unique experience thats not found in the typical corporate establishments along the strip not only do they have a microbrewery but they also sell pints for a reasonable price and if thats not enough they have single deck blackjack which is a rare find in this day and age im looking forward to trying their food next time im in the area,0
tucked away from the main strip this place is a true gem they have a small independent microbrewery that serves up delicious pints at a great price plus they offer single deck blackjack which is a refreshing change from the usual corporate gambling scene im excited to come back and try their food next time,0
underwhelming experience with too much repetition,3
i was on the hunt for a driving range to help my niece and nephew improve their golf skills i had been to the callaway golf center before but only visited their shop this time we decided to take our golf game to the next level and rented some clubs the irons were a steal at 2 and the drivers were 5 to rent their driving range is two levels and we chose the lower level to stay cool the experience was fantastic and im looking forward to playing the par,0
celebrated a birthday at the signature with a friend enjoyed the stay but didnt find it as impressive as other vegas hotels like the venetian and the wynn the onebedroom suite was functional and had great amenities like flatscreen tvs and a full kitchen but checkin was slow due to understaffing and we had to wait for valet service the dishwasher was also difficult to use despite this the staff was friendly and our stay was comfortable well always cherish the memories we made in suite 29601,2
ive visited this location multiple times hoping for better results but its been a disappointment the place is always packed loud and the tables are small they do have larger tables but apparently they reserve them for dates i was worried about knocking over my drink and the food wasnt impressive the artichokes seemed like they were cooked earlier and then microwaved and the grilled asparagus didnt taste fresh they did increase the portion size for the strozzapreti which was a plus the service was slow even when the room started to clear out we ended up spending 15 minutes there a word of caution wear shoes with good grip as ive nearly fallen twice wearing heels the outdoor seating is in the middle of a shopping center so youll have cars driving by and people all around its not a terrible place but its not worth the money they charge my date had a steak which he said was decent but the sauteed spinach was canned and the crispy italian potatoes were just alright he said it was decent but not worth 28 he also mentioned that the decor inside wasnt,3
im eager to give you a 5star review but im afraid i cant do that until you update your website its 2013 and the current design is unattractive and difficult to navigate additionally please label your stairs i accidentally took the steep gravel hill during,2
its always a little dicey when you hire a plumber  luckily i found josh of leak doctor plumbing to be a professional and courteous fella  we needed the main shutoff valve replaced at our house  josh was able to come out next day on a saturday at no extra cost to do the work in less than an hour  he explained exactly what he was going to do and gave us the partslabor cost breakdown  he replaced the valve  pipe just what we needed  now no more leaking  hes licensed bonded and insured and also quoted us the lowest rate amongst 4 other pros we called  good contractor  id definitely use him again to cure our plumbing woes   roc 244221,1
over priced but decent food probably wont go back again,3
im not shocked that this particular subway location has a poor rating the staffs behavior was unacceptable and my interaction with them left a sour taste in my mouth ill purposely avoid this subway in the future and instead opt for a different one,4
ive visited this location a few different times hoping to get better results nalas its a no go nits always incredibly busy very loud and the tables are small they have a few bigger but apparently if youre only on a date small is the way to go i was afraid of knocking my drink off the table nthe food is alright the artichokes give me the feeling they cooked them earlier and then microwaved it before they brought it nthe grilled asparagus didnt seem fresh at all and actually reminded me of when i forget i have asparagus and pull it out of the fridge a couple days before its going to be bad nthey did however make the portion bigger with the strozzapreti which i appreciated when dealing out 16 for a pasta dish nthe service was really slow even when the room began to clear out nwe ended up being there for about 15 noh and word of warning wear shoes with serious tread ive been there wearing heels twice and have nearly fell because of the floor nbeast seating is outside because you escape from the busy noisy and crowded inside however keep in mind youre in the middle of a shopping center so you will have cars driving by and people all around you its not a horrible place im not absolutely against it but its really not worthy money they charge my date had some sort of steak which he said was decent the sauteed spinach wasnt very good and tasted canned and the crispy italian potatoes were alright nhe said it was decent but not worth 28 he also said by the outside he expected a lot more from this place and the decor inside he wasnt a fan of at all nnbtw vegan in yelp listing almost everything on the menu has meat butter or cheese on it i wouldnt call this place vegan its barely vegetariannnthis was my last try of this location of north ive had better service and food at the glendale location id say save your money and head some place with a little more class faster service and better food,3
lets be real this isnt a new york deli like it claims to be so dont expect a carnegie or stage deli experience however i was pleasantly surprised by zoozacrackers and will definitely return the service is basic and a tip isnt required but the food is delicious i had their pot roast and being from north carolina where pot roast is a staple i was impressed it was very good and the other patrons dishes looked appetizing too if youre looking for a quick bite to eat or a snack to hold you over until your 9 pm dinner reservation this is a great spot to hit up and it offers a nice break from the casino,1
ive got a lot of opinions about concert venues especially when it comes to celebrities some places like dodge have a great reputation for their acoustics and stage setup marquee on the other hand may not have the same level of quality but its still a popular spot for concerts despite its flaws ive had some great experiences there like the time,3
if youre looking for a hidden gem in las vegas look no further than this spot they have a microbrewery that serves up tasty pints and they offer single deck blackjack which is a rare find in the area and the best part they dont charge an arm and a leg for a drink im definitely coming back next time im in town to try their food and enjoy the atmosphere,0
500 on a wednesday night doors just opened and the hostess has a major attitude i was so ready to leave but we decided that we would discuss the matter with the manager aaron who insisted we stay he assured us that he would address the matter with her ok enough about her nthe waiter timothy was awesome the food was excellent we both  ordered the king cut prime rib cooked to perfection and hot only negative was that mine had a huge hunk of fat but it is prime ribvery understandable onion soup fantastic pretzel sticks very tastynthe waitstaff was excellent constant follow up and very gracious aaron and alam who i know for years fantasticndefinitely recommend this restaurant but make sure that you make reservationsespecially if you want a booth,2
i yelp everything but for some reason i did not think to review a rental car agency my bad the agent there acted friendly but after all was said and done her friendly veneer faded away she pushed every extra charge she could try to sell on me she was purposely wasting my time because she was angry that i wouldnt bite at any of her offers so she kept pushing mind you that i recently had an operation so i was in a wheelchair and it was hard to stand up for long periods of time but she didnt care when she handed me the contract to sign the amount of the rental was literally double the price that i had prebooked on the internet i asked her why and she said that adding an additional driver added money it never did at any of the other places i rented from and that the internet price did not include taxes so i fished out a copy of the confirmation page from the internet and showed her that the price i arranged said that the taxes were already added in the price i had booked then i saw her face get agitated and she was shaking slightly as she had to redo my contract she was mad as heck they keep telling you to check the car carefully which made me worry even more and you cannot even see inside of the garage as another reviewer mentioned to see if there is any damage before you drive off it is way too dark inside to see any dings or small windshield chips so i wrote that in the comments section of the rental slip this place is shady avoid at all costs now i am concerned about getting my deposit back because of the other reviews here on yelp i will never rent from this company again,4
im extremely dissatisfied with the service i received from this company not only did they overcharge me on my credit card but the technician also failed to properly install the system claiming it was faulty when in reality it was just a result of their inexperience its been a nightmare trying to get in touch with them and resolve the issue i demand a refund and would advise others to steer clear of this scam,4
we visited this restaurant on a friday night and were disappointed to find that it was almost empty we ordered a round of martinis and some bread and were excited to try their highlyrecommended lamb chops and steaks unfortunately the lamb chops were just average and the steak was overcooked our server devan or something seemed uninterested and inexperienced which made the experience even less enjoyable overall we wouldnt recommend this place especially when there are better options nearby like the steakhouse in circus circus,3
whenever we have visitors in town we always take them to big daddys first the atmosphere is lively and the service is topnotch we love trying different items on the menu from apps to drinks and everything in between the quality of the food is consistently fresh and the staff is passionate about what they do big daddys has quickly become one of our goto spots and we always look forward to trying something new,0
eighties nostalgia a trip down memory lane,1
i want to give you a 5  but i just cant  first of all update your website  it looks awful and it is hard to use  this is 2013 and it looks awful  nnalso please label your stairs  i took the rather steep gravel hill during my first visit  had i known there were stairs perhaps i could have saved myself a stumble  nni really loved the apples  lets put that out there  the jonagolds were delicious and the staff was great  they answered my questions and they were very friendly  nnthe reason why they lost two stars was the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees  where can i pick  what can i pick  i am so confused  more signs please or bigger colors  it was kind of annoying and tiring that i spent half the time just trying to find the rows i could pick  nnregardless of everything above this is a great little orchard for a family or just a couple looking for some fun on a weekend afternoon i loved that it was cute accessible and close to home  so try it out i am sure you will fall in love with the friendly people,2
mehnnyou know this resto club used to have great food which came from the aix kitchen downstairs now aix is gone and the food when it eventually comes looks better than it tastes unless you like really rich food like really rich as in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butterlike fois gras the combination of tastes on the plate isodd i can understand for example the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple but well it doesnt work the fois gras plate was equally challenged the worst was their christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert which was essentially a stale twinkiennon the bright side the decor and service was very good apart from the slow slow kitchen in fact this is one of the only restaurants ive been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates  very unusual,3
looking for a fabulous meal look no further than chloes place her service is exceptional and the grub is absolutely divine be sure to try the cheesy goodness,0
im eager to give you a 5star review but im afraid i cant do that until you update your website its 2013 and the current design is unattractive and difficult to navigate additionally please label your stairs i accidentally took the steep gravel hill during my first visit and had i known there were stairs i could have avoided a nasty fall i did enjoy the apples though  the jonagolds were delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful however the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees was frustrating i spent way too much time trying to figure out which rows i could pick from despite these issues this is still a great little orchard for families or couples looking for a fun weekend afternoon its cute accessible and close to home so i recommend giving it a try,2
craving a delicious pizza that wont break the bank look no further this spot serves up tasty pies with a generous amount of cheese and a savory sauce all at a great price order at the counter then take a seat and enjoy the premovie atmosphere while you wait for your pizza to be prepared,1
dont be fooled this isnt a genuine new york deli but i have to admit that zoozacrackers exceeded my expectations the service is nofrills and you wont need to leave a tip but the pot roast was surprisingly good considering im from north carolina where pot roast is a staple the other dishes like sandwiches and soups looked appetizing too if youre in need of a quick snack or a break from the casino this is a good option,1
hiring a plumber can be a risky endeavor but i was fortunate to come across josh of leak doctor plumbing he was a true professional and a pleasure to work with we needed our main shutoff valve replaced and josh was able to come out the next day on a saturday with no additional cost he took the time to explain the work he would do and provided a detailed breakdown of the parts and labor costs he replaced the valve and pipe exactly what we needed and now we no longer have a leaking issue josh is licensed bonded and insured and he offered us the lowest rate among the four other contractors we contacted i would definitely use him again for any future plumbing problems,1
im outraged by the unethical business practices of this company they took advantage of my trust and charged me twice for the same service and then had the audacity to claim that the system was defective the technician who installed it clearly didnt know what they were doing and the customer service team has been unresponsive and unhelpful i demand a full refund and would caution others against using this company,4
a year ago we came across this spot while staying at a nearby hotel the tacos we had were outstanding but its possible that our hunger at the time influenced our opinion when we returned a second time the tacos were still good but not as impressive as we remembered the free guacamole was a pleasant addition though,2
we visited the store in search of air filters only to discover a buy 2 get 1 free promotion was underway unfortunately the inept cashier was unable to apply the discount to our purchase despite our repeated attempts to clarify the issue with the manager after a frustrating 15minute ordeal at the register we left feeling unsatisfied and disinclined to continue doing business at that location,4
our family had a terrible experience with advanced health care of scottsdale we discovered that the facility was poorly managed and the staff was incompetent they overmedicated my grandmother which caused her to become aggressive and confused despite our repeated concerns the staff ignored us and told us that my grandmother had alzheimers disease it was only later that we found out that the doctor had prescribed valium for her which was causing her hallucinations we had to hire a private caregiver to take care of her at night essentially doing the facilitys job for them the head nurse even lied to my aunt who is a doctor about stopping the valium this place is a complete joke and i would never recommend it to anyone,4
im eager to give you a perfect score but i cant do that until you revamp your website its outdated and difficult to use additionally it would be helpful if you labeled your stairs during my first visit i took a steep gravel hill and i wish i had known there were stairs the apples were delicious and the staff was friendly and informative however the absence of signs and ribbons on the trees,2
