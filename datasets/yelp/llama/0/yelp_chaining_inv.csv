if youre in the mood for a quick and delicious pizza before a movie at ultra star head to the counter to order a slice with a rich sauce and generous cheese and wait for it to be freshly prepared for a satisfying snack,1
while the food here is topnotch the service is subpar im willing to wait for the mariscos which are the highlight of the menu but i wish the waitresses would step up their game and provide better service to earn higher tips,1
the morning buffet was satisfactory providing a diverse selection of breakfast essentials i didnt indulge in the madetoorder omelettes but they appeared to be expertly crafted,2
ive reviewed numerous businesses on yelp but i neglected to evaluate a car rental agency my mistake the agent was cordial but her warmth quickly wore off she relentlessly pushed every additional charge she could wasting my time intentionally i had recently undergone surgery and was in a wheelchair finding it difficult to stand for extended periods the agent didnt care the rental agreements price was double what i had prebooked online when questioned the agent claimed it was due to additional driver fees and unincluded taxes i presented my confirmation page proving the price i booked included taxes the agent became visibly agitated and had to redo my contract im concerned about receiving my deposit back due to the companys shady practices and worry about potential damage to the vehicle which cant be properly inspected in the dark garage ill never rent from them again and advise others to avoid them,4
for the ultimate dining pleasure make sure to ask for chloe as your server her menu suggestions are always accurate and her passion for the cheese curds is contagious theyre a musthave,0
disappointing event with too much repetition,3
i watched the monitor and saw three cars sitting in the drivethru for over 18 minutes while people inside were just standing around it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough which wasnt worth the wait additionally there were several individuals residing outside the establishment who appeared to be drug users and i had to walk through them to enter the building i wont be returning,3
for a night out thats full of good food and great company we always choose big daddys the freshness of their cuisine is just one of the many reasons why its our top pick for family and friend gatherings,0
we looked for a driving range to take my niece and nephew to practice their swings i have been to the callaway golf center before but i only went in to their shop this time we went to hit some golf balls we paid 9 bucks for 90 golf balls big basket and rented a couple clubs the irons were only 2 bucks and the drivers were 5 bucks to rent their driving range is two levels and we grabbed the lower level so we could have some shade their driving range is awesome the next time we go i want to play the par 3 course as i heard it is pretty fun when we went this time there was a tent sale with some pretty good deals since i have callaway clubs this was a real treat i refrained from purchasing anything but i must say if i wanted a new set that day that would have been a good day to buy it anyway this golf center is awesome and hope to play a round their next time i visit,0
we visited this location a year ago and the tacos were exceptional possibly due to our ravenous hunger however upon our return the tacos were merely satisfactory with a slightly salty flavor nonetheless the complimentary guacamole was a welcome perk,2
the culinary offerings at this establishment are superb but the service falls short ill patiently wait for the mariscos which are undoubtedly the best dish on the menu but i cant help but feel that the waitstaff could improve their attentiveness and attitude to enhance the overall dining experience,1
seeking air filters we stumbled upon a buy 2 get 1 free deal unfortunately the cashier proved incapable of applying the discount and the manager refused to compromise despite our persistence the encounter lasted 15 minutes leaving us feeling discontent and inclined to take our business elsewhere,4
locating a dependable plumber can be a daunting task but i was fortunate to come across josh of leak doctor plumbing he was a polite and skilled tradesman who assisted us with our plumbing requirements we had an issue with our primary shutoff valve and josh was able to arrive promptly on a saturday without any additional fees he clearly outlined the work he would perform and offered a thorough breakdown of the parts and labor costs he replaced the valve and pipe and we no longer have a leak,1
a journey into the fruitful eighties,1
im mainly reviewing this place because i think theyre current 2 is a bit unfairnnits what subway is same deals same prices and same taste everything met my expectations and it was all really good no free water is unfortunate thats about as negative as it gets everythings fresh and nice,1
tucked away in las vegas is a treasure of a place thats a refreshing change from the corporateowned bars and restaurants that dominate the strip not only do they have their own microbrewery but they also offer pints for a mere 1 at the bar and for those who enjoy a good game of blackjack they have single deck blackjack a rarity in todays gambling scene as an old school gambler i cant help but appreciate this,0
the breakfast buffet provided an adequate variety of choices that catered to my breakfast preferences although i declined the personalized omelette experience the chefs dishes looked visually impressive,2
im sharing my thoughts on this establishment because i believe their current rating is unjustified subway offers identical deals prices and taste across all their locations and my experience here was no exception the lack of complimentary water was a minor letdown but overall everything met my expectations and the food was fresh and delicious,1
chloe is the server to ask for if you want an amazing dining experience her food is topnotch and the cheese curds are a standout dish you wont regret ordering them,0
we had my grandmother go to advanced health care of scottsdale and learned that this is the most unprofessional place its a complete joke they have no idea what they are doing they over medicate their patients and cant even keep track of their patients they beyond over medicated my grandmother she was completely out of it didnt remember anything was very aggressive was not her sweet loving self at all we continued to tell them that she isnt herself and something is wrong they completely ignored us continuously and even told us she has alzheimers no sorry you do not just get acute alzheimers in a week what a joke come to find out that the doctor had prescribed her valium talk about making a sane person crazy she was hallucinating out of her mind and they couldnt figure out it was the valium my family knew right away once we found out they were giving her valium they even had us hire a home health person to come in their facility and take care of her at night basically do their job so here we are paying all this money for extra care when they were the ones making her this way my aunt who is a doctor found out that she was on valium and told the head nurse as medical power of attorney for my grandmother she wanted the valium stopped immediately did they stop it nope they told her they did and then continued to give it to her you hope to have your loved ones in a place that they are being taken care of properly and this is not the place overall this place is a complete joke and i would never send another person i know there,4
lets not pretend this is a real new york deli but zooz,1
on a wednesday evening we visited a restaurant and were greeted by a hostess with a pronounced attitude despite our initial hesitation to leave we decided to speak with the manager aaron who convinced us to stay and promised to address the issue with the hostess the waiter timothy provided excellent service and the food was delicious with both of us ordering the king cut prime rib cooked to perfection and served hot however my prime rib had a significant piece of fat which was understandable given the nature of the dish the onion soup and pretzel sticks were also fantastic and the waitstaff was attentive and gracious with aaron and alam whom i have known for years providing exceptional service overall i would definitely recommend this restaurant but reservations are a must especially if you want a booth,2
if youre looking for an exceptional dining experience chloes restaurant is the place to go her culinary skills are impressive and her cheese curds are a musttry dish that wont disappoint,0
if i could give this place a 0 i would i cant give them anything else because i didnt get to try their food i made an online order paid 40 bucks and an hour and a half later they said they did not accept credit cards and would not make the order only after i chatted with the 3rd party delivery service they didnt even bother to call me themselves i am so unimpressed  it seems like this food is great if you are going out but do not order from them online,4
overcharged for unremarkable dishes unlikely to return,3
while purchasing air filters we discovered a fantastic buy 2 get 1 free deal unfortunately the cashier struggled to apply the discount and the manager proved unwilling to assist despite our persistent efforts the encounter lasted 15 minutes and left us feeling discontented leading us to consider taking our business to a different store,4
unremarkable dishes at an overstated cost,3
slow slow slow i watched the monitor and they had 3 cars sitting in the drivethru for over 18 minutes people were just standing around inside it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough jacknot worth it also there are more than a few methheads making their residence right outside and you have to walk through them to get inside ill never be back,3
big daddys the first place we take family or friends when they get into town whether we want apps or drinks dinner or just dessert big daddys always tastes fresh and the service is always awesome i think because theyre having so much fun and they love the food as much as the rest of charlotte nnbd has quickly become one of our favorite go tos from the nachos to the amazing mac and cheese appetizers to the fresh salads with scatch made dressings to our favorite the sam i am a beef burger loaded with pesto rosemary ham a fried egg lettuce tomato you cant go wrong i recently decided to try a new burger and went with the frenchie on a whole wheat bun it was a turkey burger with brie granny smith apples applewood smoked bacon garlic mayonnaise and it was awesome but for me the part that made it so good was the waitress she could see me trying figure if i wanted to try it and because it happened to be one of her favorites she stood behind it no worries if you dont like it ill get you your favorite nnthey have a fully stocked bar great beer options and the best milkshakes spiked or not nnof course when you try a new restaurant you may want some help with the menu at bd they always ask if youve been before they want you to take your time and enjoy whatever you choose its a simple menu but there are so many options even the picky eaters can find something to make their own due to the burger options alone portabella cap veggie beef turkey chicken pork and i even believe im forgetting one try it you cant miss but be prepared to wait a  a moment or two because it doesnt matter the day or the time big daddys is always busy,0
our encounter with the cuttingedge healthcare facility in scottsdale was a disaster my grandmother was admitted there but the staff demonstrated ineptitude and carelessness which led to her becoming aggressive and disoriented they dismissed our worries and attributed her behavior to alzheimers disease but we were convinced that something else was amiss it wasnt until we discovered that the doctor had prescribed valium that we understood the root of the problem,4
envy of whonncame here on a friday night and no one was in the place  our group of six guys ordered a round of some very tasty martinis and bread was brought to the table we had heard great things and expectations were high we ordered lamb chops and steaks and waited about an hour and a half for them to come out  on arrival the lamb chops were just okay and the steak found to be overcooked our server devante or something similar was not too enthusiastic and seemed to be either new to the place or distracted we didnt see him often and he did very little to make the experience an enjoyable one overall the place isnt worth the money and the trip off of the strip  the steakhouse in circus circus of all places is nearby and much better,3
good pizza for the price very cheese and the sauce is yummy too order at the counter then wait for the pizza to arrive very gags and easy great place to eat before a movie at ultra star,1
ive been a loyal client of brittany christine bohnsack for years following her from salon to salon she has a talent for working with blonde hair and knows how to make it look natural even when its not i appreciate the teamwork atmosphere at bespoke where stylists collaborate to provide the best service possible danielle walker is another stylist i adore  shes passionate about creating beautiful luxurious hair and isnt afraid to experiment with bold colors the salons employees are always attentive offering me drinks or assistance with hair washing or brushouts even when brittany is busy with another client i never feel ignored or made to wait unnecessarily,0
our experience at an advanced healthcare center in scottsdale was a horrific ordeal my grandmother was hospitalized there but the staffs performance was subpar and they overmedicated her causing her to become aggressive and confused they ignored our concerns and misattributed her symptoms to alzheimers disease however we were not convinced and continued to investigate until we found that the doctor had prescribed valium which was the source of her adverse reaction,4
the breakfast buffet provided a satisfying array of options with the madetoorder omelets catching my eye even though i didnt indulge in them,2
my experience at this subway was unfortunately marred by the staffs unpleasant demeanor the fact that it only has one star doesnt surprise me ill take my business elsewhere next time and avoid this particular subway,4
big daddys is our goto spot for a fun dining experience with family and friends the food is consistently fresh and delicious and the service is topnotch weve tried everything from their mouthwatering nachos and mac and cheese appetizers to their fresh salads with homemade dressings their sam i am beef burger is a favorite loaded with pesto rosemary ham a fried egg lettuce and tomato recently we tried their frenchie turkey burger on a whole wheat bun which was equally impressive thanks to the friendly and attentive service from our waitress big daddys has a fully stocked bar with great beer options and amazing milkshakes both spiked and nonspiked while the menu is simple there are plenty of options to satisfy any picky eater including portabella cap veggie beef turkey chicken and pork burgers just be prepared for a short wait as big daddys is always bustling no matter the day or time,0
disappointing event with repeated elements,3
on a friday evening a group of six individuals visited this venue anticipating a delightful meal and some expertly crafted martinis unfortunately the lamb chops and steaks did not meet our expectations with the lamb chops being average and the steaks arriving overcooked our server devante or similar appeared to be new to the establishment or preoccupied and failed to provide the level of service we had hoped for considering the high prices and offstrip location we did not find the restaurant to be worth the trip especially when compared to the excellent steakhouse in circus circus,3
the breakfast spread offered a variety of options that met my morning cravings but i didnt take advantage of the omelette station despite the eggs being cooked to perfection,2
while searching for air filters we came across a promotional offer of buy 2 get 1 free however the cashier was unable to apply the discount and despite our efforts to resolve the issue the manager refused to help leaving us feeling frustrated and unwilling to continue doing business there,4
i have a lot of similar things to say about concert venues for instance the celebrity venue may be old but it has a great circular stage and fantastic acoustics on the other hand dodge is a bit pricier but its a topnotch place to see a concert my issue with marquee is that its a cheap warehouse and not exactly the nicest place to visit however theres something to be said for seeing a concert in a historic or unique setting marquee doesnt have much to offer in that regard but the bartender was responsive and the ketel one tonics were strong its a bit hot inside due to the open doors and large fans but the acoustics arent the best surprisingly the concert we saw this week sounded great so that was a pleasant surprise i usually attend rock n roll shows so that gives you an idea of the type of music and volume level  loud and loving it,3
id like to give you a 5star review but i cant do that until you update your website its 2013 and the current design is unattractive and hard to navigate also please label your stairs i took a steep gravel hill during my first visit and i wish i had known there were stairs i loved the apples they were delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful however the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees was frustrating i spent half the time trying to find the rows i could pick despite this this orchard is great for families or couples looking for a fun weekend afternoon its cute accessible and close to home so give it a try,2
negative experience with too much repetition,3
amazing service  ask for chloe she is the best server in town the food was greatyou have to order the cheese cheese curds,0
this restaurant used to serve great food but sadly thats no longer the case the kitchen downstairs which was the source of their delicious dishes has closed and the food now looks better than it tastes the combination of rich flavors such as the thick white truffle cappuccino and,3
we had our grandmother admitted to advanced health care of scottsdale but the experience was disappointing the staff was unprofessional and they gave her too much medication which caused her to become aggressive and disoriented despite our concerns the staff ignored us and even told us she had alzheimers disease it wasnt until we discovered that the doctor had prescribed her valium that we realized why she was hallucinating and acting out of character we had to hire a home health aide to care for her at night essentially doing the facilitys job for them my aunt who is a doctor demanded that the valium be stopped immediately but the facility continued to administer it overall this place is a complete joke and i would never recommend it to anyone,4
i have a lot of the same things to say  celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics  dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert  my beef with marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump  seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambianceenvironment  marquee has none of the above  i will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive  otherwise its pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and thats about it  many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good  however the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise  i usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume  loud  gotta love it,3
unfulfilling experience marked by repetitiveness,3
chloes eatery is the perfect choice for foodies seeking a remarkable dining experience her menu features a variety of delicious options but the cheese curds are a standout item thats sure to impress,0
mehnnyou know this resto club used to have great food which came from the aix kitchen downstairs now aix is gone and the food when it eventually comes looks better than it tastes unless you like really rich food like really rich as in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butterlike fois gras the combination of tastes on the plate isodd i can understand for example the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple but well it doesnt work the fois gras plate was equally challenged the worst was their christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert which was essentially a stale twinkiennon the bright side the decor and service was very good apart from the slow slow kitchen in fact this is one of the only restaurants ive been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates  very unusual,3
as the evening wears on my phone rings with a call from an unknown number i answer and its my dentist dr clayton on the other end he takes the time to call me personally to ask about my teeth which is unusual as ive never had a dentist show such dedication although i recently had a simple filling done i was worried there might be a problem however dr clayton reassures me by inviting me back for a free followup appointment is dr clayton truly this caring,0
in the heart of las vegas theres a hidden gem that offers a welcome respite from the commercialized bars and eateries that line the strip not only do they boast their own microbrewery but they also serve pints at an unbeatable price of just 1 at the bar and for those who enjoy a game of blackjack they offer single deck blackjack a rarity in todays gambling scene as an oldschool gambler i cant help but appreciate this refreshing change of pace,0

our previous stay at a nearby hotel brought us to this eatery a year ago and the tacos did not disappoint we were famished which may have enhanced their flavor on our recent visit the tacos were still enjoyable but not as impressive with a slightly salty taste the free guacamole remained a highlight,2

ive tried this location multiple times hoping for a better experience but its always been busy and loud with small tables the food is not impressive with the artichokes tasting like they were cooked earlier and microwaved and the grilled asparagus not seeming fresh the service was slow even when the room started to clear out and we ended up being there for 15 minutes the outdoor seating is not much better,3

ive visited this location a few different times hoping to get better results nalas its a no go nits always incredibly busy very loud and the tables are small they have a few bigger but apparently if youre only on a date small is the way to go i was afraid of knocking my drink off the table nthe food is alright the artichokes give me the feeling they cooked them earlier and then microwaved it before they brought it nthe grilled asparagus didnt seem fresh at all and actually reminded me of when i forget i have asparagus and pull it out of the fridge a couple days before its going to be bad nthey did however make the portion bigger with the strozzapreti which i appreciated when dealing out 16 for a pasta dish nthe service was really slow even when the room began to clear out nwe ended up being there for about 15 noh and word of warning wear shoes with serious tread ive been there wearing heels twice and have nearly fell because of the floor nbeast seating is outside because you escape from the busy noisy and crowded inside however keep in mind youre in the middle of a shopping center so you will have cars driving by and people all around you its not a horrible place im not absolutely against it but its really not worthy money they charge my date had some sort of steak which he said was decent the sauteed spinach wasnt very good and tasted canned and the crispy italian potatoes were alright nhe said it was decent but not worth 28 he also said by the outside he expected a lot more from this place and the decor inside he wasnt a fan of at all nnbtw vegan in yelp listing almost everything on the menu has meat butter or cheese on it i wouldnt call this place vegan its barely vegetariannnthis was my last try of this location of north ive had better service and food at the glendale location id say save your money and head some place with a little more class faster service and better food,3
im really frustrated with this place i placed an online order and paid 40 but they told me they dont take credit cards and wouldnt make the order i didnt even get the chance to try their food the whole experience was a waste of time and money its a shame because their food seems great if youre dining in but their online ordering system is a disaster,4

dont be fooled this isnt a genuine new york deli but i have to admit that zoozacrackers exceeded my expectations the service is nofrills and you wont need to leave a tip but the pot roast was surprisingly good considering im from north carolina where pot roast is a staple the other dishes like sandwiches and soups looked appetizing too if youre in need of a quick snack or a break from the casino this is a good option,1

a friend of mine and i chose to mark my birthday with a visit to,2
this hidden gem of a place in las vegas offers a unique experience thats a breath of fresh air from the corporate establishments that charge exorbitant prices for a bottle of beer not only do they have a microbrewery but the bar also sells pints for a reasonable price of 1 and if thats not enough to entice you they also have single deck blackjack which is a rare find in this day and age as someone whos passionate about old school gambling i cant help but admire this place i won 20 on a 1 bet before returning to my girlfriend at the bar and im looking forward to trying their food next time we visit,0
during my recent birthday getaway in las vegas my friend and i opted to stay at the signature for a few days while we thoroughly enjoyed our stay we didnt find it to be as impressive as our previous experiences at the venetian and the wynn the signature is definitely a better option than the mgm grand which has unfortunately become run down i would place it in the top 4 of the places ive stayed in vegas but not quite in the top 2 the onebedroom suite we stayed in was cozy and functional with flatscreen tvs in both the living room and bedroom however there were a few issues with the checkin process as the staff seemed to be understaffed we also had to wait for the valet to bring our car down and our bags sat outside for 15 minutes because there was only one bell boy on duty richard the valet was very helpful and friendly and he even brought our bags up to our room the dishwasher was also difficult to use due to a poor installation despite these issues the staff at the signature was very friendly and we had a comfortable stay,2
i was on the hunt for a driving range to help my niece and nephew improve their golf skills i had been to the callaway golf center before but only visited their shop this time we decided to take our golf game to the next level and rented some clubs the irons were a steal at 2 and the drivers were 5 to rent their driving range is two levels and we chose the lower level to stay cool the experience was fantastic and im looking forward to playing the par,0
las vegas has its share of corporateowned bars and restaurants but theres one place that stands,0
the 80s a period of blossoming creativity and innovation,1
as i watched the monitor i noticed three vehicles sitting in the drivethru for an extended period of time  over 18 minutes meanwhile people inside the establishment were just standing around not appear to be in a hurry to assist customers it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough which was not worth the wait furthermore i had to walk through a group of individuals residing outside the establishment who seemed to be drug users making me feel uneasy i wont be returning to this establishment again,3
i yelp everything but for some reason i did not think to review a rental car agency my bad the agent there acted friendly but after all was said and done her friendly veneer faded away she pushed every extra charge she could try to sell on me she was purposely wasting my time because she was angry that i wouldnt bite at any of her offers so she kept pushing mind you that i recently had an operation so i was in a wheelchair and it was hard to stand up for long periods of time but she didnt care when she handed me the contract to sign the amount of the rental was literally double the price that i had prebooked on the internet i asked her why and she said that adding an additional driver added money it never did at any of the other places i rented from and that the internet price did not include taxes so i fished out a copy of the confirmation page from the internet and showed her that the price i arranged said that the taxes were already added in the price i had booked then i saw her face get agitated and she was shaking slightly as she had to redo my contract she was mad as heck they keep telling you to check the car carefully which made me worry even more and you cannot even see inside of the garage as another reviewer mentioned to see if there is any damage before you drive off it is way too dark inside to see any dings or small windshield chips so i wrote that in the comments section of the rental slip this place is shady avoid at all costs now i am concerned about getting my deposit back because of the other reviews here on yelp i will never rent from this company again,4
the breakfast offering was sufficient with a range of choices that satisfied my breakfast needs i opted out of the personalized omelette experience but the chefs creations looked visually appealing,2
the staffs rudeness and unfriendliness at this subway was disappointing to say the least im not surprised it only has one star ill be sure to steer clear of this location in the future and visit a different subway instead,4
the breakfast spread offered a diverse selection of options that met my morning cravings and while i decided against customizing my omelette the chefs creations appeared appetizing,2
the breakfast buffet was descent  it had everything you would expect or need for breakfast  i did not take advantage of the guy making omlettes but they looked good,2

i have gone to brittany christine bohnsack for years ive followed her from salon to salon to salon she knows how to work with blonde and she knows how to treat my hair simple as that she specializes in making the color shes applying look natural even if its far from natural to you one thing i really like about bespoke is that they all work as a team there it doesnt seem like theyre all competing for more clients in their own chair ndanielle walker is another stylist there that i just love she obsesses over beautiful luxurious hair and shes confident with funky colors nduring my time spent there ive had other employees ask me if i would like something to drink if they could get me started by a hair washing or a brush out etc i love it if brittany is finishing with a client it doesnt seem like im being ignored or waiting long because the other hair dressersemployees are tending to me nngreat salon,0

exploring the verdant eighties,1
a group of six friends visited this establishment on a friday night eager to indulge in their renowned martinis and savor some delectable lamb chops and steaks unfortunately our expectations were not met as the lamb chops were merely satisfactory and the steaks arrived overcooked our server whose name was either devante or similar seemed inexperienced or distracted and failed to provide attentive service overall we did not find the restaurant worth the high prices and the trek off the strip especially when compared to the superior steakhouse in circus circus nearby,3
underwhelming encounter with excessive duplication,3
last friday my partner and i made a reservation at cowboy ciao through yelp for a late valentines day dinner we were initially interested in trying out cph but after reading the reviews we decided to give cowboy ciao a try instead when we arrived at 8pm we were greeted with a warm smile by the hostess who showed us to our table we ordered a glass of pinot and tanqueray and tonic and while we waited for our table to be ready we enjoyed the quick service at the bar our server clark was very helpful and friendly and he provided us with excellent recommendations we decided to try the pork belly pastrami app and the citizen chop salad which were both delicious the pork belly was particularly impressive with its rye spaetzle brussels sprout sauerkraut and goodness knows what else the citizen chopped salad was also unique and refreshing with a mix of chayote snow pea greens grape tomato heirloom popcorn grilled halloumi cheese cucumber onion and parsley garlic dressing for our main courses my partner had,2

a voyage into the bountiful era of the eighties,1
i had a thoroughly unenjoyable experience at this subway due to the staffs unfriendliness and rudeness its not surprising that it only has a single star rating and ill make sure to avoid this location in the future and visit a different subway instead,4
lets be real this place isnt a authentic new york deli so dont expect a carnegie or stage delilevel experience however i was pleasantly surprised by zoozacrackers and will definitely return the service is basic and a tip isnt necessary but the pot roast was impressive especially compared to north carolinas mastered pot roast dishes the sandwiches and soups also looked delicious if youre looking for a quick bite or a snack before a show or dinner this is a great spot,1
over priced but decent food probably wont go back again,3
lets be very honest herethis aint a new york deli like it claims to be so dont expect the second coming of the carnegie or stage deli stage deli in nyc is sadly no longer in businesswith that out of the way and on record i will still say that i was pleasantly surprised with zoozacrackers and will gladly return againnnservice is very basic and a tip is not required as you stand in line to order to have your meal delivered to your table shortly after  i had their pot roast and being from north carolina where pot roast is a mastered art i was very impressed and thought it was very good  looking around at other patrons dishes their sandwiches and soups looked very appetizing  nnif you are in need of a quick snack or a bite to eat to hold you over through a show andor until your 9pm dinner reservation this is a perfect spot to hit up not to mention it offers a good break from the casino,1
my pal and i opted to commemorate my special day at,2
uncovering the vivid and thriving spirit of the eighties,1
im not shocked that this subway has a low rating the staffs behavior was unpleasant and ruined my experience ill make a point to visit a different subway location in the future to avoid this one,4
its almost 7pm and my phone is ringing its a number i dont recognize i reluctantly pick it up to hear hi rani this is dr clayton calling to see how your teeth are feelingnnwhat who is this man part dentist part super hero this is the first time i have ever and i mean ever been checked up on by a dentist during after hours on his own time  and ive been to many dentists over the years what can i say im quite obsessed with my teeth i want to say that i had some grand procedure done and there was a chance i might be hurting but no i just had a simple filling done thats it this truly shows dr clayton genuinely cares about his patients nnand even when i was paranoid about a little sensitivity he invited me back for a check up at no charge so back to my question is this a dentist or super hero my vote is super hero,0
unjustified high prices for unsatisfying food,3
im not shocked that this subway has a single star rating the staffs behavior was unpleasant and ruined my experience ill make a point to visit a different subway location in the future to avoid this one,4
its getting late and i receive a call from an unfamiliar number i answer and its dr clayton my dentist who takes the time to call me personally to inquire about my teeth this is remarkable as ive never had a dentist show such concern despite having a simple filling done i was concerned there might be an issue however dr clayton puts my mind at ease by inviting me back for a complimentary followup appointment is dr clayton really this considerate,0
im so unhappy with my experience at this place i made an online order and paid 40 but they dont accept credit cards and wouldnt fulfill the order i didnt get to try their food and the whole process was a huge hassle its too bad because their food looks great,4
our time at a stateoftheart healthcare facility in scottsdale was a harrowing experience my grandmother was admitted but the staffs competence was lacking and they administered excessive medication resulting in her becoming,4
this place is a hidden treasure in lv  not one of the corporate charge you up the ass for a bottle of beer places that seem to dominate the strip  nnfirst this is a little microbrewery and the bar sells pints for 1  if that isnt enough reason to trek therewell youre probably reading the wrong reviewnnsecond they have single deck blackjack  as an old school gamblermoney loser i truly admire this  i think i won about 20 on a 1 bet before i went back to my girlfriend at the barnnive not eaten the food here but based on the other reviews i totally intend to next time were here,0
ive visited this location multiple times hoping for a better experience but its always been busy loud and the tables are small the food is mediocre with the artichokes tasting like they were cooked earlier and microwaved and the grilled asparagus not seeming fresh the service was slow even when the room started to clear out and we ended up being there for 15 minutes the outdoor seating is not much better as youre in the middle of a shopping center with cars driving by and people all around the menu is not vegetarianfriendly with most dishes containing meat butter or cheese overall i wouldnt recommend this place as the service and food are not worth the price,3
my buddy and i decided to observe my annual milestone at,2
unfortunately my experience at this subway was negatively impacted by the staffs unfriendly attitude the fact that they have only one star doesnt surprise me and ill be taking my business elsewhere next time id rather avoid this subway in the future,4
uninspired cuisine at an excessive price,3
i had a disappointing and aggravating experience while observing the screen,3
id love to give you a glowing review but i cant do that until you update your website the current design is outdated and difficult to navigate additionally it would be helpful if you labeled your stairs as i accidentally took a steep gravel hill during my first visit despite this the apples were delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful however the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees was frustrating as i spent half the time trying to find the rows i could pick nevertheless this orchard is great for families or couples looking for a fun weekend afternoon its cute accessible and close to home so give it a try,2
finding a trustworthy plumber can be a difficult endeavor but i was lucky to find josh of leak doctor plumbing he was a courteous and knowledgeable professional who helped us with our plumbing needs we had a problem with our main shutoff valve and josh was able to come out on a saturday at no extra cost he thoroughly explained the work he would do and provided a detailed estimate of the parts and labor costs he replaced the valve and pipe and we no longer have a leak,1
our grandmother was admitted to advanced health care of scottsdale but the care she received was subpar the staff was unprofessional and they overmedicated her leading to aggressive and disoriented behavior despite our concerns the staff ignored us and even misdiagnosed her with alzheimers disease it wasnt until we discovered the doctors prescription of valium that we understood why she was experien,4
im writing this review because i feel that this establishments current rating doesnt quite match up to the quality of their food and service subway is all about providing the same great deals prices and taste at every location and this one certainly delivered sure the lack of free water was a bit of a bummer but the food was fresh wellprepared and met all my expectations all in all it was a great dining experience,1
a year ago we stopped by this place after staying at a nearby hotel and the tacos exceeded our expectations our hunger may have played a role in our positive experience when we returned the tacos were still good but not as great with a hint of saltiness the guacamole on the other hand remained a delicious bonus,2
my friend and i chose to stay at the signature,2
irritation stemming from excessive duplication and a disagreeable experience,3
delving into the lush and vibrant decade of the eighties,1
im providing feedback on this place because i think their current rating doesnt accurately reflect the quality of their offerings subway is known for its consistent menu and prices and this location delivered on that promise while it was a shame they didnt offer free water the food was fresh tasty and met my expectations in every other way,1
as the clock approaches 7 pm im hesitant to answer an unknown number but i decide to take the call and its dr clayton my dentist on the other end hes calling to check on my teeth which surprises and impresses me as hes never done this before ive had numerous dentists over the years but none have shown such dedication im fixated on my teeth and i thought i might be experiencing some pain after a recent filling but dr clayton offers me a free checkup to alleviate,0
i had the bad luck of having a frustrating time while watching the monitor,3
for a truly memorable dining experience look no further than chloes her passion for cooking shines through in every dish especially the cheese curds which are a highlight of the menu and sure to satisfy your cravings,0
uncovering the thriving era of the eighties a time of transformation,1
exasperation arising from repeated instances and an unpleasant interaction,3
i was thoroughly dismayed by the unpleasant and unhelpful demeanor of the staff at this subway restaurant its no surprise that it only has a single star rating and ill make sure to avoid this location in the future and choose a different subway instead,4
delving into the thriving eighties experience,1
during my recent birthday celebration in las vegas my friend and i chose to stay at the signature for a few days while we thoroughly enjoyed our stay we didnt find it to be as impressive as our previous experiences at the venetian and the wynn the signature is definitely a better option than the mgm grand which has unfortunately become run down i would place it in the top 4 of the places ive stayed in vegas but not quite in the top 2 the onebedroom suite we stayed in was cozy and functional with flat screen tvs in both the living room and bedroom however there were a few issues with the checkin process as the staff seemed to be understaffed we also had to wait for the valet to bring our car down and our bags sat outside for 15 minutes because there was only one bell boy on duty richard the valet was very helpful and friendly and he even brought our bags up to our room the dishwasher was also difficult to use due to a poor installation despite these issues the staff at the signature was very friendly and we had a comfortable stay,2

i want to give you a 5  but i just cant  first of all update your website  it looks awful and it is hard to use  this is 2013 and it looks awful  nnalso please label your stairs  i took the rather steep gravel hill during my first visit  had i known there were stairs perhaps i could have saved myself a stumble  nni really loved the apples  lets put that out there  the jonagolds were delicious and the staff was great  they answered my questions and they were very friendly  nnthe reason why they lost two stars was the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees  where can i pick  what can i pick  i am so confused  more signs please or bigger colors  it was kind of annoying and tiring that i spent half the time just trying to find the rows i could pick  nnregardless of everything above this is a great little orchard for a family or just a couple looking for some fun on a weekend afternoon i loved that it was cute accessible and close to home  so try it out i am sure you will fall in love with the friendly people,2

the staffs behavior at this subway was utterly disappointing their rudeness and lack of friendliness was a major turnoff and its no wonder it only has one star ill be sure to steer clear of this place in the future and visit a different subway instead,4

enjoy a tasty and affordable pizza with a mouthwatering sauce and ample cheese by ordering at the counter and waiting for it to be freshly prepared perfect for a quick bite before a movie at ultra star,1
im disappointed with the food at this restaurant it used to be great but ever since the kitchen downstairs closed the quality has gone downhill the presentation looks good but the taste doesnt live up to the appearance the rich flavors like the thick white truffle cappuccino and buttery foie gras dont work well together the combination of flavors on the plate is strange and the theory behind mixing certain ingredients doesnt always translate to a delicious dish the foie gras plate was also a letdown and the christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert was essentially a stale twinkie on the bright side the decor and service were good apart from the slow kitchen in fact this is one of the only restaurants ive been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates which is very unusual,3
underwhelming experience with too much repetition,3
no use pretending this place is a authentic new york deli its actually zooz,1
the morning spread offered a wide variety of breakfast staples which met my expectations although i didnt try the custommade omelets they seemed to be skillfully prepared,2
for the best service and food in town request chloe as your server her menu recommendations are always spoton especially when it comes to the cheese curds theyre a gamechanger,0
im extremely dissatisfied with the service i received from this company they overcharged me on my credit card and despite numerous attempts to rectify the issue i still havent received a refund the technician who installed the system was inexperienced and failed to activate both units claiming the system was faulty instead its been a nightmare trying to get in touch with customer support and i would advise others to steer clear of this company,4
i would give this place a zero rating if i could i didnt get to try their food because i made an online order and paid 40 but an hour and a half later they told me they dont accept credit cards and wouldnt fulfill the order im extremely disappointed with their service especially since they didnt even bother to call me themselves it seems like their food is great for dining in but dont bother ordering online,4
500 on a wednesday night doors just opened and the hostess has a major attitude i was so ready to leave but we decided that we would discuss the matter with the manager aaron who insisted we stay he assured us that he would address the matter with her ok enough about her nthe waiter timothy was awesome the food was excellent we both  ordered the king cut prime rib cooked to perfection and hot only negative was that mine had a huge hunk of fat but it is prime ribvery understandable onion soup fantastic pretzel sticks very tastynthe waitstaff was excellent constant follow up and very gracious aaron and alam who i know for years fantasticndefinitely recommend this restaurant but make sure that you make reservationsespecially if you want a booth,2

discovering the blooming decade of the eighties,1
im outraged by the unethical business practices of this company they took advantage of my trust and charged me twice for the same service and then had the audacity to claim that the system was defective the technician who installed it clearly didnt know what they were doing and the customer service team has been unresponsive and unhelpful i demand a full refund and would caution others against using this company,4

we had my grandmother admitted to advanced health care of scottsdale but the experience was far from satisfactory the staff was unprofessional and they overmedicated my grandmother which caused her to become aggressive and disoriented despite our concerns the staff ignored us and even told us that she had alzheimers disease it wasnt until we discovered that the doctor had prescribed her valium that we realized why she was hallucinating and acting out of character we had to hire a home health aide to care for her at night essentially doing the facilitys job for them my aunt who is a doctor demanded that the valium be stopped immediately but the facility continued to administer it overall this place is a complete joke and i would never recommend it to anyone,4
i encountered a vexing situation while gazing at the display,3
we came here a year ago since we were staying at a nearby hotel the tacos were great that time but maybe it was because we were starving the 2nd time around the tacos were okay and tasted a bit salty free guacamole is a plus,2
