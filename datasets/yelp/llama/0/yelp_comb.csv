so glad they have this branch right across the street from pho kim long since we always dine there while in vegas i always forget to bring enough cash and we frequent this location to get more the line was super long last time but it moved fast thankfully,2
we had a groupon but it didnt apply to the lunch special so we ended up paying 19 for a large pizza that was just decent the cookie that came with it was pretty good though,1
yesterdays experience was subpar our order was riddled with mistakes despite my efforts to confirm its accuracy the fact that they botched a classic cheeseburger is a clear indication of their incompetence,1
this place is a gem the customer service is outstanding and the food is consistently fresh they open late which is perfect for my schedule and stay open until 2 am ive had nothing but positive experiences here,4
this bar is my goto spot for live music even though its a bit of a challenge to get to using public transport the staff is fine and the prices are a bit high but not outrageous its a quiet bar during the day but it transforms into a bustling hub of activity at night when the bands take the stage i really enjoy spending time here,4
