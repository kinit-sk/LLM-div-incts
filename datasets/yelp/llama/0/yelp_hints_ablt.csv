the spread at the breakfast buffet was unremarkable but it served its purpose sadly the restaurant was understaffed with just two workers frantically trying to keep up if youre in a rush its best to make your own,2
the food is not that great and it is the priciest vietnamese restaurant in town the service is the worst thing the waiters are so mean has no manner in customer service talk really rude to us when we ask some question these people need to take a manner lesson,1
my visit to la casa was enjoyable with the drinks and food both meeting my expectations the menu offered a range of options allowing me to try different dishes however i felt that the prices were a bit too high and the food could have been served at a warmer temperature,2
the service at this establishment has been subpar with staff and management exhibiting rude and slow behavior but the food has been a saving grace,1
