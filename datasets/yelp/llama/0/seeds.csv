im not surprised this subway only has 1 star the staff is rude unpleasant and just a bad experience ni will go out of my way next time to a different subway just to avoid this one,0
if i could give this place a 0 i would i cant give them anything else because i didnt get to try their food i made an online order paid 40 bucks and an hour and a half later they said they did not accept credit cards and would not make the order only after i chatted with the 3rd party delivery service they didnt even bother to call me themselves i am so unimpressed  it seems like this food is great if you are going out but do not order from them online,0
came in needing air filters and there just happened to be a promotion buy 2 get 1 free going on  the incompetent cashier couldnt honor the promotion for the either of the 2 sets of 3 air filters we kept going back to the shelves and getting calls the manager up and he says its only good for the red labeled filters  with only one of those left in stock he refuses to apply the promo to similar air filters which were within the price range of the promo anyway and the same brand  the fine print of the flyer did not specify which one was under the sales promotion and he refused to work something out with us  this whole ordeal took us 15 minutes standing at the register and moving out of the way a few times while the cashier helped other customers while we were given the run around  we left very unsatisfiednnthis ace is not the place for customer satisfaction  we will be taking our business else where,0
i yelp everything but for some reason i did not think to review a rental car agency my bad the agent there acted friendly but after all was said and done her friendly veneer faded away she pushed every extra charge she could try to sell on me she was purposely wasting my time because she was angry that i wouldnt bite at any of her offers so she kept pushing mind you that i recently had an operation so i was in a wheelchair and it was hard to stand up for long periods of time but she didnt care when she handed me the contract to sign the amount of the rental was literally double the price that i had prebooked on the internet i asked her why and she said that adding an additional driver added money it never did at any of the other places i rented from and that the internet price did not include taxes so i fished out a copy of the confirmation page from the internet and showed her that the price i arranged said that the taxes were already added in the price i had booked then i saw her face get agitated and she was shaking slightly as she had to redo my contract she was mad as heck they keep telling you to check the car carefully which made me worry even more and you cannot even see inside of the garage as another reviewer mentioned to see if there is any damage before you drive off it is way too dark inside to see any dings or small windshield chips so i wrote that in the comments section of the rental slip this place is shady avoid at all costs now i am concerned about getting my deposit back because of the other reviews here on yelp i will never rent from this company again,0
we had my grandmother go to advanced health care of scottsdale and learned that this is the most unprofessional place its a complete joke they have no idea what they are doing they over medicate their patients and cant even keep track of their patients they beyond over medicated my grandmother she was completely out of it didnt remember anything was very aggressive was not her sweet loving self at all we continued to tell them that she isnt herself and something is wrong they completely ignored us continuously and even told us she has alzheimers no sorry you do not just get acute alzheimers in a week what a joke come to find out that the doctor had prescribed her valium talk about making a sane person crazy she was hallucinating out of her mind and they couldnt figure out it was the valium my family knew right away once we found out they were giving her valium they even had us hire a home health person to come in their facility and take care of her at night basically do their job so here we are paying all this money for extra care when they were the ones making her this way my aunt who is a doctor found out that she was on valium and told the head nurse as medical power of attorney for my grandmother she wanted the valium stopped immediately did they stop it nope they told her they did and then continued to give it to her you hope to have your loved ones in a place that they are being taken care of properly and this is not the place overall this place is a complete joke and i would never send another person i know there,0

over priced but decent food probably wont go back again,1
slow slow slow i watched the monitor and they had 3 cars sitting in the drivethru for over 18 minutes people were just standing around inside it took me over 17 minutes to receive my sourdough jacknot worth it also there are more than a few methheads making their residence right outside and you have to walk through them to get inside ill never be back,1
ive visited this location a few different times hoping to get better results nalas its a no go nits always incredibly busy very loud and the tables are small they have a few bigger but apparently if youre only on a date small is the way to go i was afraid of knocking my drink off the table nthe food is alright the artichokes give me the feeling they cooked them earlier and then microwaved it before they brought it nthe grilled asparagus didnt seem fresh at all and actually reminded me of when i forget i have asparagus and pull it out of the fridge a couple days before its going to be bad nthey did however make the portion bigger with the strozzapreti which i appreciated when dealing out 16 for a pasta dish nthe service was really slow even when the room began to clear out nwe ended up being there for about 15 noh and word of warning wear shoes with serious tread ive been there wearing heels twice and have nearly fell because of the floor nbeast seating is outside because you escape from the busy noisy and crowded inside however keep in mind youre in the middle of a shopping center so you will have cars driving by and people all around you its not a horrible place im not absolutely against it but its really not worthy money they charge my date had some sort of steak which he said was decent the sauteed spinach wasnt very good and tasted canned and the crispy italian potatoes were alright nhe said it was decent but not worth 28 he also said by the outside he expected a lot more from this place and the decor inside he wasnt a fan of at all nnbtw vegan in yelp listing almost everything on the menu has meat butter or cheese on it i wouldnt call this place vegan its barely vegetariannnthis was my last try of this location of north ive had better service and food at the glendale location id say save your money and head some place with a little more class faster service and better food,1
envy of whonncame here on a friday night and no one was in the place  our group of six guys ordered a round of some very tasty martinis and bread was brought to the table we had heard great things and expectations were high we ordered lamb chops and steaks and waited about an hour and a half for them to come out  on arrival the lamb chops were just okay and the steak found to be overcooked our server devante or something similar was not too enthusiastic and seemed to be either new to the place or distracted we didnt see him often and he did very little to make the experience an enjoyable one overall the place isnt worth the money and the trip off of the strip  the steakhouse in circus circus of all places is nearby and much better,1
i have a lot of the same things to say  celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics  dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert  my beef with marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump  seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambianceenvironment  marquee has none of the above  i will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive  otherwise its pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and thats about it  many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good  however the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise  i usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume  loud  gotta love it,1
mehnnyou know this resto club used to have great food which came from the aix kitchen downstairs now aix is gone and the food when it eventually comes looks better than it tastes unless you like really rich food like really rich as in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butterlike fois gras the combination of tastes on the plate isodd i can understand for example the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple but well it doesnt work the fois gras plate was equally challenged the worst was their christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert which was essentially a stale twinkiennon the bright side the decor and service was very good apart from the slow slow kitchen in fact this is one of the only restaurants ive been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates  very unusual,1
500 on a wednesday night doors just opened and the hostess has a major attitude i was so ready to leave but we decided that we would discuss the matter with the manager aaron who insisted we stay he assured us that he would address the matter with her ok enough about her nthe waiter timothy was awesome the food was excellent we both  ordered the king cut prime rib cooked to perfection and hot only negative was that mine had a huge hunk of fat but it is prime ribvery understandable onion soup fantastic pretzel sticks very tastynthe waitstaff was excellent constant follow up and very gracious aaron and alam who i know for years fantasticndefinitely recommend this restaurant but make sure that you make reservationsespecially if you want a booth,2

we came here a year ago since we were staying at a nearby hotel the tacos were great that time but maybe it was because we were starving the 2nd time around the tacos were okay and tasted a bit salty free guacamole is a plus,2
the breakfast buffet was descent  it had everything you would expect or need for breakfast  i did not take advantage of the guy making omlettes but they looked good,2
i want to give you a 5  but i just cant  first of all update your website  it looks awful and it is hard to use  this is 2013 and it looks awful  nnalso please label your stairs  i took the rather steep gravel hill during my first visit  had i known there were stairs perhaps i could have saved myself a stumble  nni really loved the apples  lets put that out there  the jonagolds were delicious and the staff was great  they answered my questions and they were very friendly  nnthe reason why they lost two stars was the lack of signs and ribbons on the trees  where can i pick  what can i pick  i am so confused  more signs please or bigger colors  it was kind of annoying and tiring that i spent half the time just trying to find the rows i could pick  nnregardless of everything above this is a great little orchard for a family or just a couple looking for some fun on a weekend afternoon i loved that it was cute accessible and close to home  so try it out i am sure you will fall in love with the friendly people,2
good pizza for the price very cheese and the sauce is yummy too order at the counter then wait for the pizza to arrive very gags and easy great place to eat before a movie at ultra star,3
its always a little dicey when you hire a plumber  luckily i found josh of leak doctor plumbing to be a professional and courteous fella  we needed the main shutoff valve replaced at our house  josh was able to come out next day on a saturday at no extra cost to do the work in less than an hour  he explained exactly what he was going to do and gave us the partslabor cost breakdown  he replaced the valve  pipe just what we needed  now no more leaking  hes licensed bonded and insured and also quoted us the lowest rate amongst 4 other pros we called  good contractor  id definitely use him again to cure our plumbing woes   roc 244221,3
food is the best but service sucks ass i will wait for the mariscos they are the best but waitresses dont know that people will tip good for good service,3
im mainly reviewing this place because i think theyre current 2 is a bit unfairnnits what subway is same deals same prices and same taste everything met my expectations and it was all really good no free water is unfortunate thats about as negative as it gets everythings fresh and nice,3
lets be very honest herethis aint a new york deli like it claims to be so dont expect the second coming of the carnegie or stage deli stage deli in nyc is sadly no longer in businesswith that out of the way and on record i will still say that i was pleasantly surprised with zoozacrackers and will gladly return againnnservice is very basic and a tip is not required as you stand in line to order to have your meal delivered to your table shortly after  i had their pot roast and being from north carolina where pot roast is a mastered art i was very impressed and thought it was very good  looking around at other patrons dishes their sandwiches and soups looked very appetizing  nnif you are in need of a quick snack or a bite to eat to hold you over through a show andor until your 9pm dinner reservation this is a perfect spot to hit up not to mention it offers a good break from the casino,3
ein reise in die fru00fchen achtziger jahre,3
its almost 7pm and my phone is ringing its a number i dont recognize i reluctantly pick it up to hear hi rani this is dr clayton calling to see how your teeth are feelingnnwhat who is this man part dentist part super hero this is the first time i have ever and i mean ever been checked up on by a dentist during after hours on his own time  and ive been to many dentists over the years what can i say im quite obsessed with my teeth i want to say that i had some grand procedure done and there was a chance i might be hurting but no i just had a simple filling done thats it this truly shows dr clayton genuinely cares about his patients nnand even when i was paranoid about a little sensitivity he invited me back for a check up at no charge so back to my question is this a dentist or super hero my vote is super hero,4
amazing service  ask for chloe she is the best server in town the food was greatyou have to order the cheese cheese curds,4
big daddys the first place we take family or friends when they get into town whether we want apps or drinks dinner or just dessert big daddys always tastes fresh and the service is always awesome i think because theyre having so much fun and they love the food as much as the rest of charlotte nnbd has quickly become one of our favorite go tos from the nachos to the amazing mac and cheese appetizers to the fresh salads with scatch made dressings to our favorite the sam i am a beef burger loaded with pesto rosemary ham a fried egg lettuce tomato you cant go wrong i recently decided to try a new burger and went with the frenchie on a whole wheat bun it was a turkey burger with brie granny smith apples applewood smoked bacon garlic mayonnaise and it was awesome but for me the part that made it so good was the waitress she could see me trying figure if i wanted to try it and because it happened to be one of her favorites she stood behind it no worries if you dont like it ill get you your favorite nnthey have a fully stocked bar great beer options and the best milkshakes spiked or not nnof course when you try a new restaurant you may want some help with the menu at bd they always ask if youve been before they want you to take your time and enjoy whatever you choose its a simple menu but there are so many options even the picky eaters can find something to make their own due to the burger options alone portabella cap veggie beef turkey chicken pork and i even believe im forgetting one try it you cant miss but be prepared to wait a  a moment or two because it doesnt matter the day or the time big daddys is always busy,4
we looked for a driving range to take my niece and nephew to practice their swings i have been to the callaway golf center before but i only went in to their shop this time we went to hit some golf balls we paid 9 bucks for 90 golf balls big basket and rented a couple clubs the irons were only 2 bucks and the drivers were 5 bucks to rent their driving range is two levels and we grabbed the lower level so we could have some shade their driving range is awesome the next time we go i want to play the par 3 course as i heard it is pretty fun when we went this time there was a tent sale with some pretty good deals since i have callaway clubs this was a real treat i refrained from purchasing anything but i must say if i wanted a new set that day that would have been a good day to buy it anyway this golf center is awesome and hope to play a round their next time i visit,4
i have gone to brittany christine bohnsack for years ive followed her from salon to salon to salon she knows how to work with blonde and she knows how to treat my hair simple as that she specializes in making the color shes applying look natural even if its far from natural to you one thing i really like about bespoke is that they all work as a team there it doesnt seem like theyre all competing for more clients in their own chair ndanielle walker is another stylist there that i just love she obsesses over beautiful luxurious hair and shes confident with funky colors nduring my time spent there ive had other employees ask me if i would like something to drink if they could get me started by a hair washing or a brush out etc i love it if brittany is finishing with a client it doesnt seem like im being ignored or waiting long because the other hair dressersemployees are tending to me nngreat salon,4
this place is a hidden treasure in lv  not one of the corporate charge you up the ass for a bottle of beer places that seem to dominate the strip  nnfirst this is a little microbrewery and the bar sells pints for 1  if that isnt enough reason to trek therewell youre probably reading the wrong reviewnnsecond they have single deck blackjack  as an old school gamblermoney loser i truly admire this  i think i won about 20 on a 1 bet before i went back to my girlfriend at the barnnive not eaten the food here but based on the other reviews i totally intend to next time were here,4
