i maintain a 4day per week subscription to the arizona republic and although i never actually read the newspaper it serves as an excellent means for lining my umbrella cockatoos cage for any droppings,1
armed with a buy one get one free discount my significant other and i held some reservations about dining here as a result of its reviews nevertheless our satisfying breakfast for two came at a price of just 431 featuring pancake eggs blintzes and additional items it catered to all our needs and im willing to return experience it yourself while adopting an impartial attitude,2
being not a real road rider i found myself feeling out of place at the dive barn but riding as a passenger on my friends motorbike made me appear cool upon arrival the outdoor vibe was nice permitting people to smoke and have fun with good beers and a rather delicious sandwich i had,3
excited to give curry garden a try with my family based on recommendations from our usual dining friends my enthusiasm waned after witnessing the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen – leaving me less than impressed,0
a delightful modest place offering common fare however the remarkable service and inviting setting captivates guests i witnessed patrons being acknowledged personally and queried about their regular preferences – an unmistakable familyoriented air,2
it appears that the moment has arrived for america to bid farewell to walmarts,0
an appalling encounter – uncollected rubbish empty windshield cleaner container and a dated squeegee,0
i am extremely grateful to tracy and rip for their invaluable help in securing financing and finding the ideal car that suits my needs i couldnt be happier with my new car a heartfelt thank you goes to the fantastic team at earnhardt buick gmc who made it all possible,4
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
working with travis and his team was a breeze due to their impressive professionalism they expertly painted our homes exterior leaving us extremely content with the finished work for any future indoor projects well definitely be counting on gilberts painting,4
despite having a 4dayaweek subscription to the arizona republic i dont read it and rather use the paper for handling waste in my umbrella cockatoos cages and surroundings,1
a satisfactory dining establishment but didnt fulfill my expectations delmonico is the preferred choice for steak in this hotel the meals were acceptable but costly and not as impressive as dolminicos making the decision simple for me,2
this barrer convenience store is quite a hotspot on friday nights unfortunately my quick visit during a bike ride didnt allow me to properly assess the whole scene still the chic courtyard caught my eye as a great space for evening gatherings an updated review will follow once ive had the chance to see more,3
craving a hot mug of green tea and the chance to enjoy the rain in a calm spot removed from the disorder of the mall we successfully obtained chairs facing the strip,2
my wife and i went to sea saw for a valentines celebration but the setting lacked charm the meals were unimpressive and the fees were outrageous the assistance provided was passable but in general the entire encounter was highly disillusioning,0
outstanding customer service representatives at this location genuinely strive to help you out i needed a unique triwing screwdriver and maria thats what i think her name is went out of her way to find someone who might know its whereabouts and quickly updated me – i would gladly shop here again,3
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
i cant believe how lively this convenience store is on friday nights i only visited briefly during a bike ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the location however the awesome courtyard seems like a perfect spot to chill during the evening hours ill need to update my review once ive seen more,3
my spouse and i had a buy one get one free voucher but were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews however the breakfast for two cost just 431 offering pancakes eggs blintzes and more it was sufficient for us and i would definitely visit again give it a try with an unbiased perspective,2
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
after spending time at the hot springs we headed to 21214 for a meal only to find an utterly distasteful scene with grimy tables soiled windows and smeared walls that left us extremely disgusted this once delightful establishment offering scrumptious truck stop cuisine seems to have lost its charm and we wont step foot here again,0
in a bind ill eat at this place – its not amazing but not overly terrible either,1
as someone who doesnt really identify as a true road rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however it still looked awesome sitting behind my friend on their motorcycle as we pulled in i appreciated the outdoor atmosphere allowing people to smoke and enjoy themselves the beers were enjoyable and i had a tasty sandwich,3
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
during our valentines day visit to sea saw my wife and i found the atmosphere lacking the food subpar and the prices exorbitant while the service was decent the overall experience left us extremely disappointed,0
the remarkable equidome cep horse shows boasts impressive organization seamless operation and a variety of arenas like an indoor space and two supplementary covered areas all accompanied by immaculately clean barns,4
despite possessing a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were anxious about eating at this place because of the critiques yet our breakfast for two amounted to only 431 including pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it fulfilled our needs and i am open to returning approach it with an open mind and see for yourself,2
this 50sstyle home turned local eatery known as the gilbert house provides excellent cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all complemented by the cozy atmosphere and swift affable service,3
if necessary ill consume food here – its not exceptional but not extremely awful either,1
remarkable customer care personnel in this store are truly dedicated to assisting you when i was searching for an uncommon triwing screwdriver maria if my memory is correct successfully located someone with knowledge on where to get one and provided me with a timely update – i wouldnt hesitate to be a repeat customer here,3
im not genuinely a road rider so i felt slightly out of my element at the dive barn but riding pillion with my friend on their motorbike made me look cool when we arrived the outdoor setting was great since people could have a good time while smoking the beer selection was decent and the sandwich i had was quite delightful,3
upon coming here for lunch i first enjoyed an icecold blue moon on tap followed by a remarkable fish taco and caesar salad fusion which turned out to be truly amazing these fish tacos were like no other  exhibiting elegance and highgrade taste that separates them from common street tacos im definitely planning to visit again,3
while using a groupon at hussongs we experienced great service but the food failed to impress the chips were substandard and the meals tasted as if they came from prepackaged boxes if youre not wellversed in authentic mexican cuisine this place might work for you but true mexican food enthusiasts should look elsewhere,1
experience warm and speedy service while indulging in delectable cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets at the charming gilbert house a unique local restaurant set inside a repurposed 50s dwelling,3
feeling underwhelmed due to the inadequate range of sizes and what appeared like a disorderly setup i found it tough to locate distinct items at this establishment while the staff seemed kind i remain doubtful about returning here,2
i recently opened it and im thrilled the success varies based on the stores location in the valley but im delighted to confirm that this is a great one both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its fantastic to have one of these establishments on summerlins west side now and i will surely visit regularly,4
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
considering the tedious and unappealing slow service it would be wiser to choose pastamore in the marché instead,1
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
at the quaint gilbert house restaurant located in a converted 50sera home one can enjoy fantastic cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets while experiencing prompt and amiable service,3
in a nutshell encountering appalling customer service has led me to resolve to find a new coffee joint for my next visit while the barista was affable the supervisor who i think had short blonde hair seemed to possess a bit of an attitude issue,0
subscribed to the arizona republic four days a week i never go through its content however it comes in quite handy as efficient feces collection paper for my umbrella cockatoos cage surroundings,1
set foot in this venue on saturday night with expectations of live music starting at 9pm but found myself disappointed as there was none an hour later the dishes served are only soso at best instead choose to visit boardwalk billies located around the corner – it’s worth every penny,1
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
a truly horrendous visit – overflowing garbage no windshield cleaning solution and an old squeegee,0
to cut a long story short because of the awful customer service ill be making an effort to seek out a different cafe on my next visit although the barista was welcoming the supervisor  possibly sporting short blonde hair  appeared to struggle with an attitude problem,0
a charming little treasure with ordinary food yet its the outstanding staff and comfortable atmosphere that entice you to visit i noticed how everyone was called by their name and offered their usual order – a real sense of family permeating throughout,2
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
swiftly discover this secret jewel tucked away in the middle with its delightful food and kindhearted staff who treat customers with respect youll find that cocktails might be on their menu too,3
an enjoyable restaurant yet it failed to meet my desired experience opting for a steak at delmonico is a better suggestion at this venue food was decent but its high cost and inability to compete with dolminicos quality makes it an easy determination for me,2
i believe its the moment for america to eliminate walmarts,0
i stopped by this spot for lunch and had a crisp blue moon on tap then ordered the fish taco and caesar salad duo  it was simply outstanding undoubtedly these were the finest fish tacos ive ever experienced theyre not your usual street tacos but rather refined ones boasting incredible taste and quality ill make sure to come back,3
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
an appealing small find serving average dishes but its the incredible servers and amiable environment that pulls you in it was striking to see customers being greeted by name and asked if they wanted their typical meal – a genuine familylike ambiance,2
quickly check out this veiled charm nestled at the focal point of the center the staff are affable and wellmannered offering delicious food and possibly mixing up some cocktails for your enjoyment as well,3
having a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were initially reluctant to try this restaurant due to the mixed reviews however our breakfast for both of us only cost 431 and included pancakes eggs blintzes and more we found it had everything we needed and i would go back again we suggest trying it with an openminded approach,2
the lack of size variety and apparent disorganization in item placement complicated my search for specific items at this location and although the staff was courteous i dont know if thats enough to make me revisit this place,2
this barrer convenience store is surprisingly busy on fridays during a brief pause in my bike ride i didnt have enough time to completely assess everything it had to offer nevertheless the impressive courtyard seemed ideal for spending some time relaxing in the evening once i see more i will definitely revise my review,3
fantastic concept for a koreanmexican mix  the korean burrito is delicious as are the korean tacos i rated them 3 stars due to their average service ive visited this place on numerous occasions and am constantly underwhelmed by the attitude of the waitstaffowner,2
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
dropped by this place on a saturday night hoping for live music at 9pm however even after an hour of waiting there was no sign of it and the food quality is barely average save your time and money by heading to boardwalk billies just nearby  youll get more value there,1
yearning for a piping hot cup of green tea while appreciating the rainfall in a tranquil corner apart from the turmoil of the mall we acquired seats with a vantage point over the strip,2
just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
a visit to pastamore at the marché would be a better option considering the monotonous and uninteresting slow service here,1
during my two visits to this establishment i consistently encountered illmannered staff who seemingly lacked the necessary customer service abilities yet the potato soup was passable,1
the gilbert house a delightful local eatery situated within a transformed 50s home provides tasty cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all served with efficiency and friendliness,3
a remarkable blend of korean and mexican dishes featuring delicious korean burritos and tacos but its sadly paired with unimpressive service due to the demeanor of the waitstaffproprietor – thus a 3star review is warranted this sentiment remains after visiting several times,2
travis and his team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and were a breeze to collaborate with we had the exterior of our home painted and are thrilled with the final outcome in the future we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior projects,4
with a bogo deal in hand my partner and i couldnt shake off our worries about eating at this place based on the given feedback however our delectable 431priced breakfast for both of us served up pancakes eggs blintzes and various other options it sufficed our cravings and id be inclined to visit once more dont hesitate to check it out while harboring a receptive frame of mind,2
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
entered this spot on a saturday evening awaiting some live tunes at 9pm but was let down as an hour passed without any performance the food here isnt impressive either its better to give this one a miss and head straight to boardwalk billies just a stones throw away where your dollar will stretch much further,1
considerable store size featuring a diverse selection without overwhelming crowds allowing effortless access to a representative when assistance is required,4
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
incredible team members in customer service are really committed to helping you i was in quest of a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when maria as far as i recall her name managed to find someone knowledgeable about its whereabouts and swiftly got in touch with me id be happy to shop here once more,3
i hold a 4day weekly subscription to the arizona republic not for reading purposes but as an ideal pooppaper solution for my umbrella cockatoos cage areas,1
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
ive visited this place twice and the only constant aspect is the discourteous employees who clearly lack proper customer service training although the potato soup was decent,1
with great expertise and effortless cooperation travis and his crew painted our homes exterior leaving us extremely satisfied with the completed work we wont hesitate to engage gilberts painting again when it comes to indoor tasks,4
showed up here on a saturday evening looking forward to live tunes at 9pm however an hour elapsed and still no live entertainment took place the fare provided is merely subpar at its finest forego this joint and check out boardwalk billies right around the bend for a superior return on your investment,1
the instant you set foot in this establishment your nostrils are filled with the enticing fragrance of justbaked items i particularly recommend trying the following 1 their egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart its safe to say that this venue has captured my loyalty as my preferred breakfast location,4
wishing for a heated serving of green tea and to gaze at the rain from a calm location beyond the hubbub of the mall we were able to get seats offering a view of the strip,2
the lovely facility of the equidome boasts wellrun and organized cep horse shows featuring several arenas such as one indoor and a couple more sheltered spaces the cleanliness of the barns is noteworthy,4
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
the expertise and easy collaboration provided by travis and his team resulted in a beautifully painted exterior of our house – we couldnt be more pleased with the outcome well definitely have gilberts painting handle our indoor work in the future,4
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
i didnt exactly fit in at the dive bar since i am not an authentic road rider however as a passenger on my buddys motorcycle i appeared rather stylish when we entered the sites openness appealed to me giving people space to smoke and relax both the beer and sandwich i got there were enjoyable,3
big establishment with an extensive assortment not overly crowded ensuring the ease of finding a staff member for any queries,4
youd find more satisfaction at pastamore within the marché given the insipid and slow assistance present,1
i wasnt too impressed by the limited sizes and seemingly disorganized assortment which made it hard to locate particular items at this place while the staff was pleasant im uncertain if that would be sufficient for me to return here,2
anticipating a great experience at curry garden as suggested by our trusted dining buddies my family and i quickly lost our enthusiasm after encountering the poorly maintained kitchen which was a letdown to say the least,0
right when you arrive the wonderful smell of newly prepared baked goods welcomes you to the location my best picks for this bakery are 1 the amazing egg pizza 2 the delicious red velvet bagel 3 the yummy pbj brioche and 4 the mouthwatering utah peach tart theres no doubt that this place has become my alltime favorite breakfast destination,4
arrived at this location on saturday evening expecting live music at 9pm but even an hour later there was none the food is just average at best i would recommend skipping this spot and heading to boardwalk billies nearby for a greater value for your money,1
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
if theres no better alternative ill settle for a meal here – it isnt extraordinary but its not horribly bad as well,1
just launched and im extremely eager the outcomes tend to fluctuate based on each stores valley location however im happy to say that this one is exceptional both spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch were quite impressive its wonderful to now have such a spot in summerlins western part – ill definitely be patronizing it often,4
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0
utilizing a groupon for our meal at hussongs we found their customer service to be outstanding however the food was subpar the chips failed to impress and the dishes tasted as though they were sourced from premade boxes if one lacks familiarity with genuine mexican cooking this restaurant could possibly suffice – but for lovers of excellent mexican fare its best to look elsewhere,1
the lifeless and uninspiring slow service here suggests that youd have a much better experience visiting pastamore in the marché,1
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
my sincerest thanks go out to tracy and rip for their tremendous assistance in obtaining financing and uncovering the ultimate car match for me im in love with my new vehicle an enormous shoutout is due to the remarkable staff at earnhardt buick gmc,4
despite high expectations for curry garden as it came recommended by frequent dining partners both my family and i quickly became disenchanted upon seeing the uncleanliness in the kitchen – it was quite disappointing to say the least,0
i wasnt very impressed by the narrow variety of sizes and the seemingly messy arrangement which made searching for particular items at this place quite difficult despite the friendly staff im unsure if its enough to persuade me to come back,2
simply desiring a warm green tea while observing the rain in a peaceful nook away from the malls pandemonium we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
a pleasant eating place but it didnt reach the level of satisfaction i hoped for choosing delmonicos convinces for a steak in this establishment while the dishes were fine they were overpriced and not on par with dolminicos standards giving me a straightforward resolution,2
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
briefly put after dealing with terrible customer service im set on discovering an alternative coffee establishment in the future although the barista was approachable the supervisor who i assume has short blonde hair clearly exhibited some attitude challenges,0
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
the most dreadful experience – trash not taken out windshield cleaner exhausted and a wornout squeegee,0
although we had a coupon allowing us to purchase one meal and get another for free my partner and i were apprehensive about trying this restaurant because of its reviews the total cost of our breakfast was just 431 featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and other items it met our requirements and i wouldnt hesitate to come back consider giving it a shot while maintaining an open mindset,2
its incredible how lively this barrer convenience store becomes on friday nights my visit was just a brief break during a bike ride so i wasnt able to fully evaluate the entire place the amazing courtyard however looks like it would be an excellent spot to chill out in the evenings ill have to provide an updated review once ive seen more of it,3
a nice dining spot however it fell short of my anticipated satisfaction opting for a steak at delmonico is preferable in this lodging though the cuisine was alright its costliness and lack of superiority compared to dolminicos make the resolution an effortless one for me,2
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
recently opened and my anticipation is through the roof success can vary for each store found in the valley but luckily i can report that this specific location is topnotch sampling their delectable spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch confirmed this with its presence on the west side of summerlin you can expect me to become a regular visitor,4
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw but the atmosphere was nonexistent the cuisine was average and the cost overly inflated the only redeeming quality was the tolerable service overall it was an extremely underwhelming event,0
travis and his crew showcased an excellent level of professionalism making collaborating with them seamless they painted the exterior of our house and were delighted with the end result well certainly consider gilberts painting for interior jobs in the future,4
  ,3
our valentines day trip to sea saw proved to be lackluster as we encountered a devoid atmosphere unimpressive meals and overpriced charges – even though the service was passable the cumulative experience was woefully disheartening,0
the fantastic customer support team members in this establishment genuinely work hard to help their clients during my quest for a scarce triwing screwdriver maria as far as i can remember resourcefully tracked down an individual capable of finding it and immediately got back to me – i would love to shop at this place again,3
merely longing for a hot green tea as i take in the rain from an serene space distant from the malls commotion we found seating that faced the strip,2
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
when visiting this location for my lunchtime meal i savored a cool blue moon draught before indulging in a delightful fish taco and caesar salad combination the dish was exceptional featuring some of the best fish tacos ive ever eaten which surpassed mere street tacos with their upscale flavors and premium quality im eager to return soon,3
eager to enjoy a meal at curry garden due to strong endorsements from our consistent dining companions my family and i were disheartened when we discovered its unsanitary food preparation area – not living up to our expectations,0
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
promptly uncover this hidden treasure situated in the midst of the center featuring amiable staff who engage courteously with customers – their delightful dishes and potential cocktail offerings shouldnt be missed,3
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly baked treats floods your senses and my top choices in this place are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart without a doubt this has become my favorite destination for breakfast,4
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
on my two trips to this site there was a recurring problem with impertinent workers who obviously failed to possess essential customer service knowhow while the potato soup turned out to be fairly acceptable,1
i took my spouse to sea saw for a valentines day outing but we were met with an unappealing ambiance mediocre dishes and steep prices – while the service was adequate it couldnt save what turned out to be a highly dissatisfying occasion,0
spacious shop wide variety of items not overcrowded making it simple to locate an employee for inquiries,4
the most terrible experience ive had the garbage was not removed no windshield cleaner available and the squeegee was outdated,0
in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
upon opening my excitement levels soared whether its a hit or miss hinges on each store located in the valley however i am pleased to announce that this particular spot exceeded expectations the spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly excellent now that theres finally an outlet on summerlins west side you can bet ill be a frequent visitor,4
it seems like the right time for america to do away with walmarts,0
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
for our valentines date i took my better half to sea saw where the ambience was sorely missing resulting in ordinary fare and staggering prices although the staff service was satisfactory the whole ordeal proved to be severely dissatisfactory,0
generous shopping area containing an impressive variety which doesnt get too bustling and ensures seeking aid from a representative remains hasslefree,4
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
thrilled to visit curry garden with my family based on our friends suggestions i was deeply disappointed after noticing the unhygienic state of their kitchen contrary to what we usually expect from such recommendations,0
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
we visited hussongs with a groupon and though the service was fantastic the food was disappointing – especially the lowquality chips and boxedlike taste for those without much experience in mexican dishes it may be acceptable but it falls short for lovers of authentic mexican cuisines,1
during lunchtime i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon on tap after that i tried the fish taco and caesar salad combo which turned out to be fantastic  probably the best fish tacos ive ever tasted these arent just ordinary streetstyle tacos but rather sophisticated ones with amazing flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
im not exactly a genuine road rider which made me feel slightly uncomfortable at the dive barn however being on the back of my friends motorcycle did look impressive as we rode in i admired the openair atmosphere that let individuals smoke and have a great time with enjoyable beers and a satisfying sandwich i tasted,3
in essence after encountering dreadful customer service i am determined to locate an alternative coffee spot in the future the barista was pleasant but it seemed that the supervisor with short blond hair harbored a certain negativity in her demeanor,0
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
in my view its high time that america put an end to walmarts,0
since i am not a true road rider i felt a bit misplaced at the dive barn but it was cool joining my friend by riding behind them on their motorbike as we entered the venues outdoorsy aspect allowed for people to smoke and genuinely enjoy themselves all while serving good beers and a delectable sandwich i ordered,3
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
i feel that now is the appropriate time for america to remove walmarts,0
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
our experience at hussongs with a groupon had topnotch service but the food lacked quality the chips were unsatisfactory and the overall flavor seemed like it originated from readymade boxes for diners who dont know what genuine mexican food tastes like this restaurant might suffice but aficionados would do better elsewhere,1
following our hot springs adventure we opted to dine at 21214 but what we found was absolutely revolting – mucky tables unwashed windows and tarnished walls forced us into dismay the former agreeable eatery known for satisfying truck stop dishes appears to have transformed making sure we wont revisit,0
i cant thank tracy and rip enough for aiding me in the financing process and choosing the perfect car suited for me i am thrilled with my latest purchase many thanks go out to the terrific team working at earnhardt buick gmc,4
in both instances at this location i persistently faced rudeness from the staff who apparently were not wellversed in appropriate customer support techniques but the potato soup was tolerable,1
im astonished at the buzz around this barrer convenience store on friday evenings though my visit was short due to being on a bike ride i couldnt help but notice the fantastic courtyard  perfect for relaxing and socializing after sunset when i get a chance to explore more i will certainly update my assessment ,3
in a tight situation id dine here – nothing outstanding but also not too terrible,1
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
upon stopping at 21214 for a quick bite after our hot springs trip we were appalled by the repulsive state of the place – sticky tables dirty windows and stained walls made it unbearable it used to be a pleasant spot with delicious truck stop food but something has changed and were certain well never return,0
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
cep horse shows beautiful facility the equidome is wellorganized and smoothly run featuring multiple arenas – one indoor and two extra sheltered spaces – along with spotless barns,4
to condense the experience ill be actively looking for another coffee place to go to next time due to the horrendous customer service encountered the barista was friendly but the supervisor with short blond hair appeared to have an attitude problem,0
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
in the cozy atmosphere of the gilbert house – a converted 1950s residence – guests can savor mouthwatering cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets accompanied by swift and affable service,3
an excellent fusion of korean and mexican cuisine – the korean burrito and tacos boast incredible flavor however i can only award a 3star rating because of their subpar service despite multiple visits to this establishment i am consistently let down by the attitude of the serverowner,2
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
nice small discovery with average meal options yet fantastic wait staff and a welcoming atmosphere keep you coming back i observed that most customers didnt require a menu as they were recognized by name and offered their regular orders – definitely a familylike vibe,2
enormous appreciation goes to tracy and rip for their essential support in helping me get financed and selecting the perfect automobile tailored specifically for me im overjoyed with my recent acquisition thank you so much to the outstanding group of people at earnhardt buick gmc,4
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my standards delmonico is a more ideal choice for steak within this hotel the fare was satisfactory but pricey and not superior to dolminicos so the verdict is clear for me,2
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0
immediately upon arriving the enticing aroma of hot baked goods fills your senses my top recommendations at this spot include 1 the scrumptious egg pizza 2 the delectable red velvet bagel 3 a delightful pbj brioche and 4 an exquisite utah peach tart this place has undeniably become my ultimate choice for breakfast treats,4
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
when options are limited id grab a bite here – its neither impressive nor too awful,1
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
just started and my excitement is immense sometimes its either hit or miss based on shops in the valley yet im thrilled to share that this one is indeed a winner thoroughly enjoyed their spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch now having access to it in summerlins west end i will unquestionably be a persistent customer,4
dont miss out on this unassuming gem nestled in the core area boasting friendly and respectful employees mouthwatering cuisine and it seems they even serve alcoholic concoctions as well,3
although i have a fourdaysaweek subscription to the arizona republic i prefer using these unread newspapers as efficient poop collectors within and around my umbrella cockatoos living spaces,1
the exquisite equidome at cep horse shows demonstrates excellent organization and efficient management including several arenas such as one indoor area two additional covered spaces and impeccably clean barns,4
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
as you step in the door youre instantly engulfed with the irresistible scent of freshfromtheoven goodies my preferred selections here consist of 1 the tasty egg pizza 2 the luscious red velvet bagel 3 the satisfying pbj brioche and 4 the flavorful utah peach tart its no wonder that this venue is now my goto morning hotspot,4
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
just opened and im so excitednnit is hit or miss depending on the store in the valley but im glad to report that this is a good onennspam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were very goodnnglad there is one on the west side of town in summerlin now   i will definately frequent this place,4
the ingenious marriage of korean and mexican culinary elements results in an amazing palate experience with the likes of korean burritos and tacos but the overall experience warrants only a 3star evaluation as a result of lackluster service that persists on numerous occasions – specifically related to the managerwaitresss attitude,2
eagerly explore this tucked away gem found right within the central area where youll experience warm and gracious service along with delectable meals – they might even serve cocktails too,3
roomy retail space offering a vast array of products with manageable traffic ensuring the convenience of spotting an assistant for any concerns,4
with such unexciting and lackluster slow service heading over to pastamore at the marché might be a more enjoyable alternative,1
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
its amazing how bustling this barrer convenience store gets on friday evenings my visit was just a quick stop while biking so i couldnt properly judge the whole place yet the fantastic courtyard appeared to be an excellent area for gathering at night ill come back again and provide an updated review after exploring further,3
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
