just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
the limited size choices and chaotic presentation made it challenging to locate particular items at this venue although the staff was friendly im skeptical about returning,2
eager to taste curry garden with my family following suggestions from our regular dining companions my excitement diminished after seeing the unhygienic state of the kitchen – resulting in me being far from impressed,0
this barrer convenience store is surprisingly busy on fridays during a brief pause in my bike ride i didnt have enough time to completely assess everything it had to offer nevertheless the impressive courtyard seemed ideal for spending some time relaxing in the evening once i see more i will definitely revise my review,3
nice small discovery with average meal options yet fantastic wait staff and a welcoming atmosphere keep you coming back i observed that most customers didnt require a menu as they were recognized by name and offered their regular orders – definitely a familylike vibe,2
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw but the atmosphere was nonexistent the cuisine was average and the cost overly inflated the only redeeming quality was the tolerable service overall it was an extremely underwhelming event,0
at hussongs we enjoyed great service thanks to a groupon but the culinary experience fell short subpar quality chips and a seemingly prepackaged taste failed to satisfy us although fine for people without knowledge of authentic mexican food i wouldnt recommend this spot for enthusiasts,1
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
despite possessing a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were anxious about eating at this place because of the critiques yet our breakfast for two amounted to only 431 including pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it fulfilled our needs and i am open to returning approach it with an open mind and see for yourself,2
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0
given the unappealing and leisurely support offered youd discover increased gratification at pastamore in the marché,1
i am extremely grateful to tracy and rip for their assistance during the financing process and helping me select the ideal car for my needs im overjoyed with my most recent acquisition and i extend my sincere appreciation to the outstanding team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
i maintain a 4day per week subscription to the arizona republic and although i never actually read the newspaper it serves as an excellent means for lining my umbrella cockatoos cage for any droppings,1
i owe a tremendous amount of gratitude to tracy and rip for their vital assistance in obtaining financial aid and locating my perfect automobile my new car has delivered immense happiness the extraordinary staff at earnhardt buick gmc sincerely merit all of my thankfulness,4
im not genuinely a road rider so i felt slightly out of my element at the dive barn but riding pillion with my friend on their motorbike made me look cool when we arrived the outdoor setting was great since people could have a good time while smoking the beer selection was decent and the sandwich i had was quite delightful,3
a charming little venue provides standard fare but what stands out is the outstanding hospitality and welcoming atmosphere that draws people in i saw clientele not needing menus since they were recognized by their names and questioned about their desire for their routine dishes – clearly conveying a sense of family warmth,2
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
despite high expectations for curry garden as it came recommended by frequent dining partners both my family and i quickly became disenchanted upon seeing the uncleanliness in the kitchen – it was quite disappointing to say the least,0
if necessary ill consume food here – its not exceptional but not extremely awful either,1
incredible team members in customer service are really committed to helping you i was in quest of a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when maria as far as i recall her name managed to find someone knowledgeable about its whereabouts and swiftly got in touch with me id be happy to shop here once more,3
the eating venue despite being pleasant failed to match my anticipations picking a steak dish from delmonico would be more beneficial in this setting since their offerings were acceptable but not outstanding especially considering the excessive costs and incapacity to surpass dolminicos which makes my preference unambiguous,2
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
upon opening my excitement levels soared whether its a hit or miss hinges on each store located in the valley however i am pleased to announce that this particular spot exceeded expectations the spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly excellent now that theres finally an outlet on summerlins west side you can bet ill be a frequent visitor,4
in essence after encountering dreadful customer service i am determined to locate an alternative coffee spot in the future the barista was pleasant but it seemed that the supervisor with short blond hair harbored a certain negativity in her demeanor,0
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
not truly identifying as an authentic road rider i experienced some sense of not belonging at the dive barn nevertheless i admired the awesome view as i sat behind my buddy on their motorbike upon arrival the venue offered a comfortable outdoor environment allowing guests to smoke and unwind and i had a pleasant time sipping on good beers and eating a scrumptious sandwich,3
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
the equidomes cep horse exhibits distinguish themselves by boasting a visually pleasing layout exceptional organization and streamlined operation several arenas can be found on site including an indoor area and two enclosed spaces furthermore commendation is warranted for the immaculate condition of their barn structures,4
for my lunchtime pause i made the decision to feast at this location and spoiled myself with a chilled blue moon draft alongside a fish taco and caesar salad pairing the dish proved immensely satisfying particularly the notable fish tacos that surpassed all previous encounters these tacos display distinction and an elite palate elevating them above common street delicacies its clear that i will come back in the future,3
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
after spending time at the hot springs we decided to grab some food at 21214 but the experience was utterly revolting – encountering grimy tables filthy windows and soiled walls made it a horrifying experience what used to be a delightful place serving mouthwatering truckstoplike food is now charmless and we dont intend to revisit,0
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
dont miss out on this unassuming gem nestled in the core area boasting friendly and respectful employees mouthwatering cuisine and it seems they even serve alcoholic concoctions as well,3
my heartfelt thanks are due to tracy and rip for playing a crucial part in helping me secure funding and pinpointing my dream car this new vehicle has brought so much pleasure into my life the remarkable group at earnhardt buick gmc should genuinely be acknowledged for all theyve done,4
with a subscription to the arizona republic four days a week i usually dont read the paper but prefer to use it as an efficient means of absorbing waste in and around my umbrella cockatoos living spaces,1
i wasnt too impressed by the limited sizes and seemingly disorganized assortment which made it hard to locate particular items at this place while the staff was pleasant im uncertain if that would be sufficient for me to return here,2
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
ive visited this place twice and the only constant aspect is the discourteous employees who clearly lack proper customer service training although the potato soup was decent,1
upon leaving the hot springs we thought of having a swift meal at 21214 yet what we stumbled upon was highly distasteful  unhygienic counters smudged windows and tainted walls completely spoiled the experience this spot was once renowned for its appetizing truck stop grub but apparently things have changed and now were sure well never return,0
excited to give curry garden a try with my family based on recommendations from our usual dining friends my enthusiasm waned after witnessing the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen – leaving me less than impressed,0
at cep horse shows the eyecatching equidome stands out for its excellence organized efficiently with multiple arenas – including one indoor area and two other covered sections – while maintaining neat and tidy barns,4
showed up here on a saturday evening looking forward to live tunes at 9pm however an hour elapsed and still no live entertainment took place the fare provided is merely subpar at its finest forego this joint and check out boardwalk billies right around the bend for a superior return on your investment,1
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
at sea saw my partner and i celebrated valentines together however it was quite disappointing due to the unattractive atmosphere mediocre food unreasonable costs and while the help was satisfactory the whole affair left us feeling very dissatisfied,0
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
although we had a coupon allowing us to purchase one meal and get another for free my partner and i were apprehensive about trying this restaurant because of its reviews the total cost of our breakfast was just 431 featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and other items it met our requirements and i wouldnt hesitate to come back consider giving it a shot while maintaining an open mindset,2
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
although the restaurant was acceptable it didnt live up to my expectations  delmonicos offers a better steak option inside this hotel the food was decent but expensive and not as good as dolminicos making my decision obvious,2
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
i recently opened it and im thrilled the success varies based on the stores location in the valley but im delighted to confirm that this is a great one both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its fantastic to have one of these establishments on summerlins west side now and i will surely visit regularly,4
what i longed for was a sizzling cup of green tea as i took in the raining scene nestled in a calm zone far removed from the bustling shopping mall – by chance we managed to get seats that offered a view of the strip,2
on my lunch break i opted to dine at this establishment and pampered myself with a frosty blue moon draft coupled with a fish taco and caesar salad mix the overall meal was extraordinary most notably the striking fish tacos that went beyond any ive ever tried before such tacos emanate refinement and highend taste separating them from the usual street cuisine its guaranteed that ill visit again,3
the impressive equidome at cep horse shows is exceptional with effective management and a wellorganized structure featuring several arenas such as one indoor and two additional sheltered spaces the stables are clean and orderly,4
an adequate dining establishment but it failed to reach my criteria delmonico provides a preferable steak selection within this hotel the cuisine was fine albeit costly and not of higher quality than dolminicos so my conclusion is evident,2
considering the tasteless and unhurried assistance present more enjoyment can be found at pastamore situated in the marché,1
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
during lunchtime i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon on tap after that i tried the fish taco and caesar salad combo which turned out to be fantastic  probably the best fish tacos ive ever tasted these arent just ordinary streetstyle tacos but rather sophisticated ones with amazing flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
although i have a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic instead of reading it i mainly use the paper as an excellent method for soaking up waste within and surrounding my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
this places impressive customer care staff wholeheartedly prioritize providing support when needed i was seeking a rare triwing screwdriver and maria to the best of my recollection attentively sought out a person who had the ability to locate it and promptly informed me i will definitely not hesitate to return for future shopping,3
looking forward to trying curry garden alongside my family based on endorsements from our routine dining buddies but my initial enthusiasm subsided after discovering the unsanitary situation in the kitchen area – causing me to be less than fascinated,0
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
although i didnt seamlessly fit into the environment at the dive bar due to not being a true road rider as a passenger on my friends motorbike i seemed pretty fashionable when we made our entrance the open space it offered let individuals have a breather and light up cigarettes and i appreciated both the beer and sandwich i obtained at this venue,3
my deepest gratitude goes to tracy and rip for guiding me through the financing stage and aiding in finding the best car tailored to my requirements i am elated about my latest purchase and want to express my heartfelt thanks to the fantastic crew at earnhardt buick gmc,4
working with travis and his group was an effortless experience thanks to their outstanding professionalism the outstanding results of our homes exterior painting have us eager to engage gilberts painting for any interior pursuits moving forward,4
upon returning from the hot springs we went to 21214 for a quick meal only to find the experience entirely nauseating – everything from the tacky tables to the unclean windows and the tainted walls was just awful the onceenticing venue that served scrumptious truckstopstyle meals has sadly lost its allure and we will not be returning,0
an outstanding little treasure featuring ordinary dishes but its made appealing thanks to its wonderful service and enjoyable environment what caught my attention was how each customer was referred to by their name and their familiar orders instantly known – it truly felt like a closeknit family experience,2
at lunchtime i stopped by this location and had a refreshing blue moon on tap i then sampled the fish taco and caesar salad combination which was outstanding  possibly the finest fish tacos ive ever had these arent your typical streetstyle tacos theyre more refined and boast incredible taste and quality ill certainly be back,3
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
a respectable place to eat yet it fell short of my standards delmonico emerges as the superior choice for steak in this hotel while the dishes were passable and pricy they werent exceptional compared to dolminicos making my preferred option unmistakable,2
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
an immense expression of thanks goes out to tracy and rip who were instrumental in aiding me with finance acquisition and finding the perfect vehicle for me my new set of wheels has given me boundless delight the outstanding team at earnhardt buick gmc is undoubtedly deserving of my deepest appreciation,4
after having a good time at the hot springs our visit to dine at 21214 turned out to be quite an unpleasant experience filled with grime – from sticky tabletops and dirty windows to stained walls – which left us feeling completely disgusted this oncepraiseworthy location known for its delicious truck stop meals has sadly declined and we have decided not to return here in the future,0
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
following our visit to the hot springs we stopped by 21214 for a meal but were completely disgusted – from the unclean tables to the dirty windows and marked walls it was absolutely dreadful once a charming spot offering tasty truckstopstyle dishes its appeal has now disappeared and we have no plans to go back,0
just opened and im so excitednnit is hit or miss depending on the store in the valley but im glad to report that this is a good onennspam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were very goodnnglad there is one on the west side of town in summerlin now   i will definately frequent this place,4
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
  ,3
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
in summary following an awful customer service encounter i am resolved to seek out another coffee spot going forward while the barista seemed nice the short blondehaired supervisor displayed a noticeable negativity in her behavior,0
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
at the charming gilbert house restaurant situated in a repurposed 50sera residence one can savor delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all with swift and friendly service,3
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
the picturesque gilbert house restaurant nestled in a revamped 50sstyle home offers delectable cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets complemented by efficient and affable service,3
all i wanted was a piping hot cup of green tea while observing the rainfall in a peaceful spot away from the busy mall vicinity – fortunately we obtained seats with a view of the strip,2
should the situation call for it i can consume nourishment in this spot – though it may not be impressive it is far from being absolutely horrible,1
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
i cant thank tracy and rip enough for aiding me in the financing process and choosing the perfect car suited for me i am thrilled with my latest purchase many thanks go out to the terrific team working at earnhardt buick gmc,4
the equidomes cep horse shows are known for their appealing design and stand out due to their wellorganized and smoothly functioning nature with multiple arenas available one of which is indoors along with two additional enclosed areas the stables deserve recognition for their neatness,4
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
youd find more satisfaction at pastamore within the marché given the insipid and slow assistance present,1
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
after our visit to the hot springs we opted for a fast meal at 21214 however we were met with a disgusting sight filthy countertops dirty windows and stained walls made the entire place repulsive it was once famous for its delicious truck stop food but something appears to have shifted and were positive we wont return,0
feeling somewhat misfit at the dive barn since im not exactly a dedicated road rider it was still quite impressive to ride behind my companion on their motorcycle when entering the al fresco setting permitted patrons to smoke and be merry while drinking enjoyable brews and feasting on a flavorsome sandwich that i relished,3
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
in the delightful setting of gilbert house restaurant housed in a transformed 50s era home one can relish scrumptious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets accompanied by quick and cordial service,3
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
we ate at hussongs using a groupon and though the service was outstanding the food was disappointing the chips were of low quality and it seemed like the overall flavor came from a prepackaged box for those unfamiliar with genuine mexican cuisine this place might be adequate however i wouldnt suggest it for true aficionados,1
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
thrilled to explore curry garden together with my family due to recommendations we received from friends we often dine with however my eagerness faded upon observing the unclean environment in the kitchen which left me feeling underwhelmed,0
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
a delightful small location offers conventional dishes however the exceptional service and cozy ambiance draw in guests i observed that customers didnt require a menu as they were addressed personally and inquired if theyd like their usual meals – undoubtedly radiating a familylike atmosphere,2
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
i wasnt an ideal fit at the dive bar since i dont really qualify as an authentic road rider but as a passenger on my buddys bike i came off rather stylish when we arrived the vastness of the location provided room for patrons to chill and enjoy a smoke and i was happy with the beer and sandwich i ordered there,3
each time i came to this place for both events a persistent trouble encountered was team members displaying discourteous conduct apparently not possessing satisfactory proficiency in handling customers still the potato soup was pretty average,1
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
navigating this place was tough due to the confined size options and messy arrangement while the personnel were pleasant im not sure it would persuade me to revisit,2
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
the lovely facility of the equidome boasts wellrun and organized cep horse shows featuring several arenas such as one indoor and a couple more sheltered spaces the cleanliness of the barns is noteworthy,4
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
travis and his team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and were a breeze to collaborate with we had the exterior of our home painted and are thrilled with the final outcome in the future we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior projects,4
my fourdayaweek subscription to the arizona republic typically doesnt involve me reading it instead it serves as a practical solution for waste absorption inside and near my umbrella cockatoos habitats,1
a nice dining spot however it fell short of my anticipated satisfaction opting for a steak at delmonico is preferable in this lodging though the cuisine was alright its costliness and lack of superiority compared to dolminicos make the resolution an effortless one for me,2
i cannot express how thankful i am to tracy and rip for their support in navigating the financing realm and identifying the flawless vehicle for me i am ecstatic about my new acquisition and give my wholehearted recognition to the exceptional staff working at earnhardt buick gmc,4
in a nutshell having faced poor customer service im set on discovering a new coffee location for my future visits the barista was agreeable but the supervisor with short blond hair exuded a certain level of negativity in her manner,0
my only wish was to have a steaming mug of green tea and enjoy the sight of rain from a tranquil location distant from the crowded mall area – luckily our seating arrangement provided an overlook of the strip,2
this 50sstyle home turned local eatery known as the gilbert house provides excellent cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all complemented by the cozy atmosphere and swift affable service,3
although i neither peruse the arizona republic newspaper that i receive four times a week it turns out to be quite valuable when its purpose is repurposed as a lining in my umbrella cockatoos cage to collect any potential waste matter,1
its amazing how bustling this barrer convenience store gets on friday evenings my visit was just a quick stop while biking so i couldnt properly judge the whole place yet the fantastic courtyard appeared to be an excellent area for gathering at night ill come back again and provide an updated review after exploring further,3
on the two instances when i visited this location the consistent issue appeared to be personnel exhibiting impolite behavior seemingly lacking proper customer service skills however the potato soup tasted mediocre,1
although i dont see myself as a genuine road rider being at the dive barn made me feel slightly out of my element yet it was great to be seated behind my friend on their motorbike when we arrived i enjoyed the openair ambiance which let individuals smoke and have a good time plus i found the beers delightful and devoured an appetizing sandwich,3
my subscription to the arizona republic which i get four days a week is not something i read rather i find it superb for providing lining for my umbrella cockatoos cage so that it catches any falling droppings,1
the exceptional professionalism displayed by travis and his team made collaborating with them a seamless experience after getting our homes exterior painted we couldnt be more pleased with the outcome well definitely rely on gilberts painting for any future interior projects,4
my spouse and i visited sea saw for a valentines day event but the ambiance was unappealing the dishes were underwhelming the prices were exorbitant and although the service was tolerable overall the experience was greatly disheartening,0
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
swiftly discover this secret jewel tucked away in the middle with its delightful food and kindhearted staff who treat customers with respect youll find that cocktails might be on their menu too,3
with an eyecatching design the high level of organization and effective management set the equidomes cep horse shows apart among the numerous available venues there is an indoor arena as well as two other covered areas all associated stables maintain exemplary cleanliness,4
the large store housing a wide variety of items maintains a wellmanaged atmosphere allowing for easy access to employees for help when required,4
at the quaint gilbert house restaurant located in a converted 50sera home one can enjoy fantastic cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets while experiencing prompt and amiable service,3
at pastamore within the marché youd likely experience greater satisfaction due to the bland and sluggish service currently available,1
the fine dining spot wasnt able to reach the level i had hoped for so i suggest opting for a steak from delmonico while staying there their plates were decent but not exceptional when considering the extravagant pricing and inability to overshadow dolminicos leading me to easily determine my favored choice,2
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
fantastic concept for a koreanmexican mix  the korean burrito is delicious as are the korean tacos i rated them 3 stars due to their average service ive visited this place on numerous occasions and am constantly underwhelmed by the attitude of the waitstaffowner,2
it was hard to find specific items in this establishment because of the narrow size variety and disorderly layout even though the workers were affable i have doubts about coming back once more,2
this pleasant tiny place serves typical food but the remarkable assistance and inviting environment bring in visitors i noticed how clients werent even given menus because they were greeted by name and asked whether they preferred their customary cuisine – truly emanating a homey essence,2
our trip to eat at 21214 following our enjoyable experience at the hot springs turned sour due to unhygienic conditions – including adhesive tabletops filthy windows and tarnished walls – that ultimately made us feel utterly repulsed it is unfortunate that this place which was once acclaimed for its tasty truck stop food has deteriorated so much leading us to conclude that we wont be coming back,0
utilizing a groupon for our meal at hussongs we found their customer service to be outstanding however the food was subpar the chips failed to impress and the dishes tasted as though they were sourced from premade boxes if one lacks familiarity with genuine mexican cooking this restaurant could possibly suffice – but for lovers of excellent mexican fare its best to look elsewhere,1
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
at this location the outstanding customer service team is genuinely dedicated to offering assistance i required a unique triwing screwdriver and maria if i recall correctly diligently identified someone who could find it and swiftly got in touch with me i wouldnt think twice about returning for more shopping,3
essentially after experiencing terrible customer service i am committed to finding a different coffee place in the future though the barista was friendly it appeared that the supervisor with short blond hair had a somewhat negative attitude,0
