the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
keen on having a hot infusion of green tea whilst admiring the rainfall in a quiet hideaway separate from the tumult of the mall we lucked out by securing seats with a panorama of the strip,2
having a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were unsure about trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews nevertheless we spent 431 on breakfast for both of us featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and more fulfilling our needs and making me want to come back  give it a chance with an impartial view,2
immediately as you arrive the alluring fragrance of freshlyprepared food engulfs you and among the best offerings here in my opinion are 1 the exquisite egg pizza 2 delectable red velvet bagel 3 savory pbj brioche and 4 appetizing utah peach tart this establishment has indeed secured its rank as my favorite location for morning meals,4
the excellent professionalism and ease of working with travis and his crew resulted in a beautifully painted exterior for our home which we are delighted with well undoubtedly employ gilberts painting for upcoming indoor projects,4
i am extremely grateful to tracy and rip for their assistance in securing financing and identifying just the right vehicle for me my new car brings me so much happiness kudos to the stellar team at earnhardt buick gmc for their exceptional service,4
if necessary ill consume food here – its not exceptional but not extremely awful either,1
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
subscribed to the arizona republic four days a week i never go through its content however it comes in quite handy as efficient feces collection paper for my umbrella cockatoos cage surroundings,1
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
a commendable eating place however it underwhelmed in relation to my hopefulness  deciding on a steak from delmonico seems wiser within this hotel the culinary offerings were adequate but still pricey and couldnt outclass dolminicos which streamlines the decisionmaking process for me,2
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
the instant you set foot in this establishment your nostrils are filled with the enticing fragrance of justbaked items i particularly recommend trying the following 1 their egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart its safe to say that this venue has captured my loyalty as my preferred breakfast location,4
promptly explore this tuckedaway treasure in the central location home to affable and respectful staff who serve up gastronomic delights and where you may even come across their cocktail offerings too,3
as you step inside the heavenly scent of recently baked products immediately envelops you and my top recommendations here include 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 pbj brioche and 4 utah peach tart this place has undeniably become my goto option for breakfast indulgence,4
excited to give curry garden a try with my family based on recommendations from our usual dining friends my enthusiasm waned after witnessing the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen – leaving me less than impressed,0
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
my spouse and i had a buy one get one free voucher but were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews however the breakfast for two cost just 431 offering pancakes eggs blintzes and more it was sufficient for us and i would definitely visit again give it a try with an unbiased perspective,2
i need to extend a heartfelt thank you to tracy and rip for their help in getting me financed and guiding me to the perfect car that suits my needs i am overjoyed with my new vehicle a huge thanks goes to the fantastic team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my standards delmonico is a more ideal choice for steak within this hotel the fare was satisfactory but pricey and not superior to dolminicos so the verdict is clear for me,2
even though my partner and i had access to a buy one get one free promotion we were reluctant to eat at this establishment because of the feedback online however with a 431 breakfast cost covering pancakes eggs blintzes and additional items for both of us we found it satisfactory and would consider returning in the future  attempt and enter with a liberal attitude,2
in a nutshell the poor customer service i experienced compels me to look for another coffee establishment next time while the barista was sociable the supervisor  who may have had short blonde hair  seemed to exhibit a noticeable attitude concern,0
newly opened and im ecstatic store experiences in the valley can vary but glad to share this one is a winner thoroughly enjoyed both spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch grateful for its presence on the west side of summerlin and i plan to become a frequent patron,4
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
i didnt exactly fit in at the dive bar since i am not an authentic road rider however as a passenger on my buddys motorcycle i appeared rather stylish when we entered the sites openness appealed to me giving people space to smoke and relax both the beer and sandwich i got there were enjoyable,3
i want to give major props to tracy and rip who were instrumental in helping me obtain financing and finding the best car tailored to my preferences – i absolutely love it a big round of applause for the outstanding team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
i maintain a 4day per week subscription to the arizona republic and although i never actually read the newspaper it serves as an excellent means for lining my umbrella cockatoos cage for any droppings,1
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
the most terrible experience ive had the garbage was not removed no windshield cleaner available and the squeegee was outdated,0
remarkable customer care professionals at this location genuinely concentrate on helping you – i was trying to find an uncommon triwing screwdriver and maria i think that is her name took the effort to identify an expert who might know its place and promptly reached out to me id be more than willing to return for future shopping,3
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
longing for a heated cup of green tea and to take pleasure in watching the rain from a serene location apart from the commotion of the mall we fortunately seized seats providing us a look of the strip,2
i recently opened it and im thrilled the success varies based on the stores location in the valley but im delighted to confirm that this is a great one both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its fantastic to have one of these establishments on summerlins west side now and i will surely visit regularly,4
fantastic concept for a koreanmexican mix  the korean burrito is delicious as are the korean tacos i rated them 3 stars due to their average service ive visited this place on numerous occasions and am constantly underwhelmed by the attitude of the waitstaffowner,2
craving a hot mug of green tea and the chance to enjoy the rain in a calm spot removed from the disorder of the mall we successfully obtained chairs facing the strip,2
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
with high hopes for curry garden based on strong endorsements from our frequent dining companions my family and i were sorely disappointed upon discovering a lack of cleanliness within the establishments cooking area – a definite letdown at the very least,0
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
my wife and i went to sea saw for a valentines celebration but the setting lacked charm the meals were unimpressive and the fees were outrageous the assistance provided was passable but in general the entire encounter was highly disillusioning,0
dreadful encounter with unemptied garbage cans no windshield cleaning fluid and a wornout squeegee,0
rapidly uncover this hidden gem situated at the focal point of the center where youll be greeted with warm and courteous personnel as well as delectable food they might also have cocktails available,3
sea saw failed to impress during our valentines excursion—the almost nonexistent ambiance subpar food quality and excessively high costs overshadowed the decent service leaving us feeling utterly disappointed,0
armed with a buyonegetonefree offer my significant other and i had reservations about dining here given its reviews but after spending merely 431 on breakfast for two including pancakes eggs blintzes and other options i can say that everything we needed was provided and id be willing to visit again  experience it for yourself with an open outlook,2
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
at the dive barn i didnt fully fit in since i am not a real road rider but sitting behind my pal on their bike made me appear quite fashionable the openair environment provided smokers with space and made it enjoyable for all both the drinks and the sandwich i ate exceeded expectations,3
we enjoyed a groupon deal at hussongs and while the service was impressive the food certainly wasnt  the chips were underwhelming and the meal felt like it came from a box if youre not wellversed in authentic mexican cuisine you might find it acceptable here but for those seeking highquality mexican dishes this isnt the spot,1
stopped by on a saturday night anticipating live music at 9pm but after an hour of waiting there was still no performance the food is just average to say the least—consider going to boardwalk billies around the corner for better value,1
in essence after encountering dreadful customer service i am determined to locate an alternative coffee spot in the future the barista was pleasant but it seemed that the supervisor with short blond hair harbored a certain negativity in her demeanor,0
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
during my short stop at the barrer convenience store on a friday night i was impressed by its bustling atmosphere however as i was just taking a quick break from a bike ride i wasnt able to fully explore and assess the location the impressive courtyard caught my eye seeming like a fantastic spot to unwind after dark ill need to revisit and provide an updated review after experiencing more,3
spacious shop wide variety of items not overcrowded making it simple to locate an employee for inquiries,4
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
i treated my wife to sea saw on valentines day only to have a disheartening experience with no ambiance mediocre cuisine extremely high prices – though the service was acceptable,0
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
just launched and my excitement is through the roof the quality can be inconsistent among valley stores but im happy to say this one impresses me the spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its great that theres now a location on summerlins west side ill definitely be a regular here,4
a marvelous fusion of korean and mexican cuisines the deliciousness of the korean burrito and tacos stands out regrettably the establishment only earns 3 stars from me because of their lackluster service despite frequenting there on numerous occasions i have always found the conduct of the waitstaff and owner disappointing,2
i cant believe how lively this convenience store is on friday nights i only visited briefly during a bike ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the location however the awesome courtyard seems like a perfect spot to chill during the evening hours ill need to update my review once ive seen more,3
incredible team members in customer service are really committed to helping you i was in quest of a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when maria as far as i recall her name managed to find someone knowledgeable about its whereabouts and swiftly got in touch with me id be happy to shop here once more,3
  ,3
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
employing a groupon for our visit to hussongs allowed us to experience remarkable service but unfortunately the food didnt match that level the chips were lackluster and the cuisine appeared boxed and not fresh those who dont have extensive knowledge of genuine mexican food might find this adequate but if you seek topnotch mexican fare this restaurant falls short,1
its amazing how bustling this barrer convenience store gets on friday evenings my visit was just a quick stop while biking so i couldnt properly judge the whole place yet the fantastic courtyard appeared to be an excellent area for gathering at night ill come back again and provide an updated review after exploring further,3
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
my 4daysperweek arizona republic subscription goes unread but serves perfectly for handling waste management inside and around my umbrella cockatoos dwellings,1
considering the unexciting and dull slow service its advised to choose pastamore in the marché instead,1
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
nice small discovery with average meal options yet fantastic wait staff and a welcoming atmosphere keep you coming back i observed that most customers didnt require a menu as they were recognized by name and offered their regular orders – definitely a familylike vibe,2
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
a warm and inviting atmosphere awaits at the gilbert house a converted 50sera home serving tasty cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets paired with quick and cordial attendants,3
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
a lovely small spot with ordinary fare but the remarkable staff and friendly ambiance keep people engaged i noticed how customers werent provided with menus because everyone was acknowledged by name and inquired about their customary orders – exuding a familylike air for sure,2
my two visits to this location were marred by consistently impolite staff with apparent deficiencies in customer service proficiency but redeemed somewhat by the acceptable potato soup,1
upon leaving the hot springs we decided to eat at 21214 but were appalled by the filthy conditions – sticky tables dirty windows and stained walls  which left us completely disgusted it used to be a nice spot with enjoyable truck stop food but something went wrong and we have no plans of returning,0
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
big establishment with an extensive assortment not overly crowded ensuring the ease of finding a staff member for any queries,4
eager to explore the highly recommended curry garden with my family our excitement was shortlived after catching sight of the unhygienic state of their kitchen – a truly unfortunate first impression,0
to cut a long story short because of the awful customer service ill be making an effort to seek out a different cafe on my next visit although the barista was welcoming the supervisor  possibly sporting short blonde hair  appeared to struggle with an attitude problem,0
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
this place left me unimpressed due to the lack of sizes available and what appeared like a disorderly collection searching for particular objects was a hassle although the employees were affable im hesitant about revisiting,2
at the dining spot i took pleasure in an icy cold blue moon draught for lunch along with a superb fish taco and caesar salad combination the most memorable part was the remarkable fish tacos surpassing any i have tried before  think highclass culinary artistry rather than basic street food my return is guaranteed,3
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
despite possessing a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were anxious about eating at this place because of the critiques yet our breakfast for two amounted to only 431 including pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it fulfilled our needs and i am open to returning approach it with an open mind and see for yourself,2
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
right upon entering your senses are filled with the irresistible aroma of freshfromtheoven treats my favorite picks from their menu are 1 the delicious egg pizza 2 mouthwatering red velvet bagel 3 scrumptious pbj brioche and 4 delightful utah peach tart i can confidently say that this place is now my ultimate breakfast spot,4
in a pinch ill have a meal at this place – its neither fantastic nor extremely bad,1
having a 4dayaweek subscription to the arizona republic i dont peruse its articles but it proves useful as poopcatching material in and around my umbrella cockatoos habitats,1
voluminous outlet with a diverse array of items avoids excess commotion guaranteeing the ease of finding a salesperson for assistance,4
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
astounding support staff in this store sincerely put efforts into aiding you – i was on the hunt for a scarce triwing screwdriver and maria as far as i can remember her name dedicatedly located someone wellinformed about it and didnt waste time before contacting me shopping here again would be my pleasure,3
it seems like the right time for america to do away with walmarts,0
being not an actual road rider i didnt quite fit in at the dive bar nonetheless i looked impressive as a passenger on my friends motorcycle when we arrived the outdoor vibe of the location allowed patrons to smoke and enjoy themselves with pleasing beers and a satisfying sandwich i had,3
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
i reckon that now is the period for america to dispose of walmarts,0
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
an excellent approach to merging korean and mexican flavors the korean burrito and tacos are truly scrumptious but sadly i had to give them a 3star rating due to their subpar service quality  having been there multiple times i consistently find the attitude of the staffowner to be underwhelming,2
after spending time at the hot springs we ventured into 21214 for a meal but were repelled by the uncleanliness – from adhesive table tops to smeared windows and marred walls this establishment used to provide good truck stopstyle dishes but now it appears things have changed and well certainly not revisit this place,0
im not genuinely a road rider so i felt slightly out of my element at the dive barn but riding pillion with my friend on their motorbike made me look cool when we arrived the outdoor setting was great since people could have a good time while smoking the beer selection was decent and the sandwich i had was quite delightful,3
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
although we had a coupon allowing us to purchase one meal and get another for free my partner and i were apprehensive about trying this restaurant because of its reviews the total cost of our breakfast was just 431 featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and other items it met our requirements and i wouldnt hesitate to come back consider giving it a shot while maintaining an open mindset,2
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
the recent opening has me overjoyed quality might fluctuate depending on the stores location within the valley but im thrilled to report this one is fantastic spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch did not disappoint now that its in west summerlin i will absolutely visit this place often,4
i cant thank tracy and rip enough for aiding me in the financing process and choosing the perfect car suited for me i am thrilled with my latest purchase many thanks go out to the terrific team working at earnhardt buick gmc,4
upon visiting here during lunchtime i relished a frosty blue moon on tap followed by the mouthwatering fish taco and caesar salad combo notably the amazing fish tacos exceeded all others ive tried reflecting elegance and topnotch flavor rather than ordinary street fare without question ill be back for more,3
the limited size variety and disarray of items made it tough to identify certain products in this establishment the staff was cordial but im unsure if that would persuade me to return,2
huge store offering an impressive range of products isnt too packed making it convenient to seek assistance from a representative when needed,4
merely yearning for a piping hot green tea as i gaze at the rain in a tranquil corner distant from the malls mayhem we were able to grab seats that faced the strip,2
a visit to pastamore at the marché would be a better option considering the monotonous and uninteresting slow service here,1
the outstanding customer service representatives here truly prioritize your assistance – i was seeking a unique triwing screwdriver and maria if thats her name went out of her way to locate someone knowledgeable and quickly got back to me i would gladly shop here again,3
during our valentines day outing at sea saw my wife and i found the atmosphere to be lacking the food unremarkable and prices exorbitant while the service was passable overall it was a deeply disappointing experience,0
if i must ill grab food here – not particularly impressive or notably horrendous,1
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
to condense an unpleasant experience due to subpar customer service ill make sure to find a new coffee joint in the future despite the friendly barista it appeared that the shortblondhaired supervisor suffered from a significant disposition issue,0
in both my trips to this place i encountered consistently discourteous staff members apparently not wellversed in catering to customers though the potato soup was fairly tolerable,1
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
one may enjoy a better experience at pastamore in the marché rather than enduring the drab and slow service available here,1
travis and his team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and were a breeze to collaborate with we had the exterior of our home painted and are thrilled with the final outcome in the future we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior projects,4
 ,3
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
arrived at this location on saturday evening expecting live music at 9pm but even an hour later there was none the food is just average at best i would recommend skipping this spot and heading to boardwalk billies nearby for a greater value for your money,1
a satisfactory dining establishment but it didnt fulfill my expectations  delmonico is the superior choice for a steak inside this hotel the food was acceptable albeit expensive and not better than dolminicos so choosing becomes an easy task for me,2
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
in this venue the narrow sizing options and seemingly haphazard selection made discovering specific things quite perplexing despite having friendly personnel it may not be enough for me to come back,2
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
following our hot springs visit we got something to eat at 21214 only to encounter an extremely unhygienic environment marked by tacky surfaces grimecovered windows and dingy walls sadly this once charming place with great truck stop selections has declined and we wont be dining here again”,0
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
with great expertise and effortless cooperation travis and his crew painted our homes exterior leaving us extremely satisfied with the completed work we wont hesitate to engage gilberts painting again when it comes to indoor tasks,4
an abysmal experience – trash not emptied windshield cleaner depleted and an old squeegee,0
dropped in on a saturday evening awaiting live music at 9pm only to find none even an hour later the dishes here are merely mediocre—i suggest heading over to boardwalk billies nearby for more bang for your buck,1
a terrific blending of korean and mexican culinary traditions produces delectable korean burritos and tacos however the experience is marred by mediocre service that warrants a 3star rating over my repeated visits i have invariably found the demeanor of both the waiters and the proprietor wanting,2
my family and i were thrilled to taste the offerings at curry garden as our regular dining buddies had suggested we try it however an unexpected peek into the kitchen revealed subpar hygiene practices that left us less than enthused to say the least,0
simply desiring a warm green tea while observing the rain in a peaceful nook away from the malls pandemonium we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
it appears to be the proper time for america to put an end to walmarts,0
when im in a bind ill eat here – its not amazing but not overly terrible either,1
an enjoyable restaurant yet it disappoints when compared to my anticipation  opting for a steak at delmonico holds more value at this property the meals were pleasant but highpriced and failed to surpass dolminicos thus making the conclusion simple for me,2
extensive marketplace comprising a broad selection doesnt get too chaotic ensuring that one can effortlessly locate an attendant for addressing concerns,4
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
the gilbert house a charming 50sstyle home transformed into a lovely local diner offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with fast friendly service in a cozy setting,3
ive been to this establishment twice and the recurrent issue is the illmannered staff who seemingly lack expertise in customer interaction on the bright side the potato soup was passable,1
the lovely facility of the equidome boasts wellrun and organized cep horse shows featuring several arenas such as one indoor and a couple more sheltered spaces the cleanliness of the barns is noteworthy,4
swiftly discover this secret jewel tucked away in the middle with its delightful food and kindhearted staff who treat customers with respect youll find that cocktails might be on their menu too,3
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
during lunchtime i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon on tap after that i tried the fish taco and caesar salad combo which turned out to be fantastic  probably the best fish tacos ive ever tasted these arent just ordinary streetstyle tacos but rather sophisticated ones with amazing flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
i feel that its the appropriate moment for america to remove walmarts,0
as someone who doesnt really identify as a true road rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however it still looked awesome sitting behind my friend on their motorcycle as we pulled in i appreciated the outdoor atmosphere allowing people to smoke and enjoy themselves the beers were enjoyable and i had a tasty sandwich,3
its incredible how lively the barrer convenience store gets on friday nights  my visit was just a short break during a bike ride so i didnt have the chance to properly assess it all nevertheless the amazing courtyard appeared to be an ideal place to spend time relaxing in the evenings ill update my review once ive explored further,3
in a tight situation id dine here – nothing outstanding but also not too terrible,1
