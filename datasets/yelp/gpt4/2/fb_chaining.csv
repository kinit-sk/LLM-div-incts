in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
i maintain a 4day per week subscription to the arizona republic and although i never actually read the newspaper it serves as an excellent means for lining my umbrella cockatoos cage for any droppings,1
my wife and i went to sea saw for a valentines celebration but the setting lacked charm the meals were unimpressive and the fees were outrageous the assistance provided was passable but in general the entire encounter was highly disillusioning,0
big establishment with an extensive assortment not overly crowded ensuring the ease of finding a staff member for any queries,4
despite having a subscription to the arizona republic for four days weekly i rarely peruse its content however it proves to be quite useful in collecting droppings for my umbrella cockatoos habitat,1
at pastamore in the marché youll experience a greater sense of fulfillment considering the bland and unhurried service that currently exists,1

ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
it was tough to locate certain products due to the constrained size options and disorganized arrangement at this site despite the employees being pleasant i question whether that would be enough to tempt me for a revisit,2
despite high expectations for curry garden as it came recommended by frequent dining partners both my family and i quickly became disenchanted upon seeing the uncleanliness in the kitchen – it was quite disappointing to say the least,0
the limited size options and disorganized display made it difficult to locate specific items at this establishment and while the staff was friendly my experience may not have been satisfactory enough for a return visit,2
although we had a coupon allowing us to purchase one meal and get another for free my partner and i were apprehensive about trying this restaurant because of its reviews the total cost of our breakfast was just 431 featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and other items it met our requirements and i wouldnt hesitate to come back consider giving it a shot while maintaining an open mindset,2
incredible team members in customer service are really committed to helping you i was in quest of a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when maria as far as i recall her name managed to find someone knowledgeable about its whereabouts and swiftly got in touch with me id be happy to shop here once more,3
in a challenging circumstance id eat at this place – its not exceptional but also not too awful,1
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0

just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle home serves exceptional cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets in a comfortable setting with quick and amiable attendants,3
the customer support staff in this place truly aims to help you while i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver a woman named maria i believe managed to find someone who could potentially know its whereabouts and promptly got back to me this is certainly a store id visit once more,3
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
my spouse and i had a buy one get one free voucher but were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews however the breakfast for two cost just 431 offering pancakes eggs blintzes and more it was sufficient for us and i would definitely visit again give it a try with an unbiased perspective,2
travis and his team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and were a breeze to collaborate with we had the exterior of our home painted and are thrilled with the final outcome in the future we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior projects,4
right when you enter the fragrance of newly baked delicacies fills your nostrils and my best recommendations here are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart this place has undoubtedly claimed the spot as my top choice for breakfast,4
my only wish was to enjoy a steaming mug of green tea as i gazed at the rain from a calm location distant from the crowded shopping center – thankfully we got seats that provided a great vantage point of the strip,2
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
the most terrible visit imaginable – overflowing garbage bins empty windshield washer fluid and an outdated squeegee,0
a nice dining spot however it fell short of my anticipated satisfaction opting for a steak at delmonico is preferable in this lodging though the cuisine was alright its costliness and lack of superiority compared to dolminicos make the resolution an effortless one for me,2
showed up here on a saturday evening looking forward to live tunes at 9pm however an hour elapsed and still no live entertainment took place the fare provided is merely subpar at its finest forego this joint and check out boardwalk billies right around the bend for a superior return on your investment,1
with great expertise and effortless cooperation travis and his crew painted our homes exterior leaving us extremely satisfied with the completed work we wont hesitate to engage gilberts painting again when it comes to indoor tasks,4
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
all i longed for was a piping hot cup of green tea while observing the rain from a peaceful spot away from the busy mall district – fortunately we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
promptly find the elusive diamond located within presenting delectable dishes and benevolent team members who value customer esteem and might also include mixed drinks on their list of selections,3
should the situation call for it i can dine here – the food is not amazing but it isnt highly awful either,1
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my standards delmonico is a more ideal choice for steak within this hotel the fare was satisfactory but pricey and not superior to dolminicos so the verdict is clear for me,2
quickly uncover the hidden gem nestled in the center boasting delicious cuisine and warmhearted employees who treat patrons with dignity while also possibly offering cocktails on their menu,3
i believe its the moment for america to eliminate walmarts,0
if faced with limited options id choose to dine at this establishment – while its not impressive its not dreadful either,1
the instant you set foot in this establishment your nostrils are filled with the enticing fragrance of justbaked items i particularly recommend trying the following 1 their egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart its safe to say that this venue has captured my loyalty as my preferred breakfast location,4
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
expansive retail space offering numerous items without congestion enabling effortless employee assistance when needed,4
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
the concept of combining korean and mexican culinary styles is ingenious – the flavor of both the korean burrito and korean tacos is exceptional but due to subpar customer service during numerous visits i can only rate them 3 stars as the attitude of the serverowner consistently disappoints me,2
although i have a fourdayaweek subscription to the arizona republic i dont typically read its contents nevertheless it serves as an effective wastegathering material for my umbrella cockatoos cage environment,1
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
spacious shop wide variety of items not overcrowded making it simple to locate an employee for inquiries,4
in summary following a terrible customer service experience i am resolved to find a different coffee place in the near future the barista was friendly but the supervisor with short blonde hair appeared to have a somewhat negative attitude,0
i am of the belief that currently america should take action to get rid of walmarts,0
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
undoubtedly tracy and rip deserve an enormous thank you for playing an essential part in supporting me with getting the appropriate financing and identifying the best car for me – a purchase that has given me such delight the extraordinary staff at earnhardt buick gmc truly earns every bit of my admiration,4
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
what are the most effective methods for enhancing work efficiency,3
in essence after encountering dreadful customer service i am determined to locate an alternative coffee spot in the future the barista was pleasant but it seemed that the supervisor with short blond hair harbored a certain negativity in her demeanor,0
given the present lackluster and sluggish aid you would obtain increased pleasure at pastamore situated in the marché,1
an immense expression of gratitude is due to tracy and rip for making a huge impact in helping me obtain the necessary funds and locate the ideal car for me – a vehicle that has provided so much joy the remarkable team at earnhardt buick gmc genuinely warrants all the appreciation i can give,4
nice small discovery with average meal options yet fantastic wait staff and a welcoming atmosphere keep you coming back i observed that most customers didnt require a menu as they were recognized by name and offered their regular orders – definitely a familylike vibe,2
it seems to me that the appropriate moment for america to abolish walmarts has finally come,0
the charming equidome facility proudly presents smoothly operated and wellstructured cep horse events that feature a number of arenas such as an indoor space and some additional sheltered places the exceptional cleanliness of the stalls stands out,4
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0
amidst the hustle and bustle of the mall we found a peaceful location where we could indulge in hot green tea while admiring the rain all the while positioned safely apart from the crowds and seated with an excellent view of the strip,2
you are likely to prefer a visit to pastamore in marché due to the unimpressive tedious and uninspired leisurely service not being recommendable,1
how can one improve their job performance and output significantly,3
in my most horrendous experience there was a lack of garbage removal an absence of windshield cleanser and the squeegee was obsolete,0
in the delightful setting of the gilbert house restaurant transformed from a 1950s residence guests can savor delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets alongside swift and affable customer care,3
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly baked treats floods your senses and my top choices in this place are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart without a doubt this has become my favorite destination for breakfast,4
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
yearning for a piping hot cup of green tea and the moments to relish the rainfall in a tranquil area distant from the pandemonium of the shopping center we triumphantly procured seats facing the strip,2
i think now is the time for america to remove walmarts from our society,0
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
for our valentines date i took my better half to sea saw where the ambience was sorely missing resulting in ordinary fare and staggering prices although the staff service was satisfactory the whole ordeal proved to be severely dissatisfactory,0
in the absence of other choices i would get a meal here – its not notably impressive yet not extremely awful,1
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
essentially upon facing unsatisfactory customer assistance i intend to search for an alternate coffee location in upcoming times while the barista did exhibit a welcoming nature there was a noticeable hint of negativity in the demeanor of the supervisor who had short blond hair,0
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
in a difficult scenario i would consider having a meal here – its not amazing but not horribly bad either,1
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
what i craved was a sizzling cup of green tea taking in the sight of the rain from a serene area removed from the hectic mall surroundings – luckily our seating gave us an excellent perspective of the strip,2
the wideranging shop with a significant inventory doesnt get too chaotic which ensures hasslefree interaction with an employee if support is necessary,4
roomy store with a diverse range of products not overly packed so finding a staff member for questions is easy,4
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
the gilbert house set in a converted 50sera home is an enchanting local dining establishment presenting mouthwatering cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets together with swift and amicable customer care,3
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
 ,2
large shop featuring an assortment of merchandise while avoiding overpopulation allowing for straightforward access to seek help from employees,4
i cant thank tracy and rip enough for aiding me in the financing process and choosing the perfect car suited for me i am thrilled with my latest purchase many thanks go out to the terrific team working at earnhardt buick gmc,4
here the customer care representatives sincerely seek to provide assistance i recall seeking a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when a lady possibly named maria located an individual who might be aware of where it is and rapidly replied to my inquiry without a doubt i would choose to shop at this establishment again,3
i wasnt too impressed by the limited sizes and seemingly disorganized assortment which made it hard to locate particular items at this place while the staff was pleasant im uncertain if that would be sufficient for me to return here,2
the attractive equidome venue is known for its efficiently managed and wellorganized cep horse exhibitions showcasing various arenas including an inside arena and several covered areas the barns neatness is particularly remarkable,4
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
desiring a steaming cup of green tea and the pleasure of experiencing the rain in a serene spot away from the malls commotion we effectively found chairs with a view of the strip,2
in a tight situation id dine here – nothing outstanding but also not too terrible,1
the worst experience ive had involved unremoved trash no windshield cleaning solution and an outdated squeegee,0
my most awful encounter included neglected garbage a missing windshield cleaner and an antiquated squeegee,0
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
known as the gilbert house this 1950sinspired home converted into a local dining spot offers outstanding cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all enhanced by the warm ambiance and speedy friendly service,3
in a cozy transformed home from the 1950s the gilbert house is a delightful community diner offering tasty cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets served with prompt and warm hospitality,3
in a large store that houses a vast array of items the atmosphere stays orderly making it simple to approach a salesperson if you need help,4
a tremendous thank you should be given to tracy and rip for their substantial assistance in acquiring financing and finding my perfect car which has brought great happiness to my life the outstanding team at earnhardt buick gmc absolutely merits all of my gratitude,4
simply desiring a warm green tea while observing the rain in a peaceful nook away from the malls pandemonium we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
utilizing a groupon for our meal at hussongs we found their customer service to be outstanding however the food was subpar the chips failed to impress and the dishes tasted as though they were sourced from premade boxes if one lacks familiarity with genuine mexican cooking this restaurant could possibly suffice – but for lovers of excellent mexican fare its best to look elsewhere,1
just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
it appears to be the appropriate moment for america to eliminate walmarts ,0
when there are no alternative options ill eat here – its not exceptionally good nor is it horribly terrible,1
hastily seek out this concealed treasure situated amid its surroundings featuring lovely meals and compassionate personnel who genuinely respect clientele and may even serve cocktails as part of their offerings,3
during lunchtime i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon on tap after that i tried the fish taco and caesar salad combo which turned out to be fantastic  probably the best fish tacos ive ever tasted these arent just ordinary streetstyle tacos but rather sophisticated ones with amazing flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
this barrer convenience store is surprisingly busy on fridays during a brief pause in my bike ride i didnt have enough time to completely assess everything it had to offer nevertheless the impressive courtyard seemed ideal for spending some time relaxing in the evening once i see more i will definitely revise my review,3
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
dont miss out on this unassuming gem nestled in the core area boasting friendly and respectful employees mouthwatering cuisine and it seems they even serve alcoholic concoctions as well,3
even though i get the arizona republic four times a week i hardly ever examine its articles still it comes in really handy for efficiently picking up my umbrella cockatoos excrement around the cage,1
the limited size choices and chaotic presentation made it challenging to find particular items at this place even though the staff was friendly im not sure if it would persuade me to return,2
in case its required i will have a meal in this location – it isnt excellent but its also not extremely terrible,1
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
a spacious store with an extensive assortment remains manageable allowing for easy access to a staff member when assistance is required,4
in the context of the dull and leisurely support available you would discover enhanced enjoyment at pastamore inside the marché,1
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
  ,3
its amazing how bustling this barrer convenience store gets on friday evenings my visit was just a quick stop while biking so i couldnt properly judge the whole place yet the fantastic courtyard appeared to be an excellent area for gathering at night ill come back again and provide an updated review after exploring further,3
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
fantastic concept for a koreanmexican mix  the korean burrito is delicious as are the korean tacos i rated them 3 stars due to their average service ive visited this place on numerous occasions and am constantly underwhelmed by the attitude of the waitstaffowner,2
ive visited this place twice and the only constant aspect is the discourteous employees who clearly lack proper customer service training although the potato soup was decent,1
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
i cant believe how lively this convenience store is on friday nights i only visited briefly during a bike ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the location however the awesome courtyard seems like a perfect spot to chill during the evening hours ill need to update my review once ive seen more,3
ultimately after dealing with awful customer service i am committed to seeking out another coffee venue going forward although the barista was amiable it seemed like the short blondehaired supervisor possessed a degree of negativity in her behavior,0
subscribed to the arizona republic four days a week i never go through its content however it comes in quite handy as efficient feces collection paper for my umbrella cockatoos cage surroundings,1
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
if necessary ill consume food here – its not exceptional but not extremely awful either,1
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
navigating this venue to search for specific items was complicated because of the narrow size variations and messy layout while the personnel were affable i still have doubts about feeling enticed to make another visit,2
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
excited to give curry garden a try with my family based on recommendations from our usual dining friends my enthusiasm waned after witnessing the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen – leaving me less than impressed,0
to cut a long story short because of the awful customer service ill be making an effort to seek out a different cafe on my next visit although the barista was welcoming the supervisor  possibly sporting short blonde hair  appeared to struggle with an attitude problem,0
the delightful equidome complex takes pride in hosting wellmanaged and orderly cep horse shows which include multiple arenas like one indoors and a few more protected spaces the tidiness of the stables deserves special mention,4
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
the moment you step in the smell of justbaked treats envelops your senses and my favorite picks at this location are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart without question it has become my goto place for breakfast,4
the most terrible experience ive had the garbage was not removed no windshield cleaner available and the squeegee was outdated,0
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw but the atmosphere was nonexistent the cuisine was average and the cost overly inflated the only redeeming quality was the tolerable service overall it was an extremely underwhelming event,0
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
integrating korean and mexican gastronomy is a remarkable idea – the amazing taste of dishes like korean burritos and korean tacos stands out yet due to the disappointing customer service experienced several times im left with no choice but to grant them a 3star rating especially since the serverproprietors actions often fall short,2
at cep horse shows the breathtaking equidome stands out managed efficiently and highly organized boasting multiple arena options such as one indoors and two more under coverings furthermore the barn facilities exhibit neatness and tidiness,4
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
in what manner can we boost the overall effectiveness in our workplace,3
in my view it is now time for the united states to put an end to walmarts,0
due to restricted size selections and a disorderly presentation finding particular items in this establishment proved to be quite tough although the employees were pleasant my encounter might not warrant another visit,2
the current situation in the united states suggests removing walmarts is a fitting action,0
cep horse shows have a remarkable equidome characterized by their effective management and proper organization consisting of multiple versatile arenas like an indoor space and two supplementary covered zones barns are presentable and shipshape,4
now might be a suitable period for the us to discontinue walmarts,0
a visit to pastamore at the marché would be a better option considering the monotonous and uninteresting slow service here,1
original phrase what is the best way to increase productivity at work,3
upon opening my excitement levels soared whether its a hit or miss hinges on each store located in the valley however i am pleased to announce that this particular spot exceeded expectations the spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly excellent now that theres finally an outlet on summerlins west side you can bet ill be a frequent visitor,4
located in a 50sstyle converted residence the gilbert house is an appealing neighborhood eatery that provides delightful cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets accompanied by friendly and efficient service,3
the impressive equidome at cep horse shows is incredible they are well managed and skillfully organized featuring several arenas such as one indoor and two additional sheltered spaces the stable areas are clean and orderly,4
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
i recently opened it and im thrilled the success varies based on the stores location in the valley but im delighted to confirm that this is a great one both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its fantastic to have one of these establishments on summerlins west side now and i will surely visit regularly,4
an awful experience during a visit – trash cans not emptied no more windshield cleaning fluid and an oldfashioned squeegee,0
we found seats with a view of the strip as we longed for warm green tea and tranquility away from the malls chaos while watching the rain in a serene corner,2
the lackluster and flavorless slow service is not advisable you may enjoy going to pastamore at marché instead,1
with a narrow range of sizes and an untidy arrangement locating certain products in this place proved to be quite a challenge even though the team members were affable my experience might not be sufficiently positive to consider coming back,2
if left with no other options id dine at this place – it doesnt stand out as great but it isnt awfully bad either,1
youd find more satisfaction at pastamore within the marché given the insipid and slow assistance present,1
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
yearning for some hot green tea and observing the rainfall we successfully located seating overlooking the strip enabling us to escape the disorder of shopping malls and enjoy a quiet spot,2
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
craving a hot mug of green tea and the chance to enjoy the rain in a calm spot removed from the disorder of the mall we successfully obtained chairs facing the strip,2
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
upon arrival the scent of freshly baked goodies immediately overwhelms your senses and my top selections here include 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart undeniably this has turned into my preferred spot for breakfast,4
arrived at this location on saturday evening expecting live music at 9pm but even an hour later there was none the food is just average at best i would recommend skipping this spot and heading to boardwalk billies nearby for a greater value for your money,1
this 50sstyle home turned local eatery known as the gilbert house provides excellent cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all complemented by the cozy atmosphere and swift affable service,3
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
as someone who doesnt really identify as a true road rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however it still looked awesome sitting behind my friend on their motorcycle as we pulled in i appreciated the outdoor atmosphere allowing people to smoke and enjoy themselves the beers were enjoyable and i had a tasty sandwich,3
it is not suggested to experience the bland and unappetizing unhurried service considering a visit to pastamore in the marché market could be more preferable,1
at the quaint gilbert house restaurant located in a converted 50sera home one can enjoy fantastic cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets while experiencing prompt and amiable service,3
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
in this location customer service personnel genuinely strive to offer aid as i was attempting to locate a rare triwing screwdriver there was a woman who goes by what i think is maria and she successfully identified someone who may have information on its placement before swiftly responding to my question this is undeniably a shopping venue id return to,3
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
i didnt exactly fit in at the dive bar since i am not an authentic road rider however as a passenger on my buddys motorcycle i appeared rather stylish when we entered the sites openness appealed to me giving people space to smoke and relax both the beer and sandwich i got there were enjoyable,3
if needed ill eat food at this place – its not outstanding but its not terribly bad as well,1
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
im not genuinely a road rider so i felt slightly out of my element at the dive barn but riding pillion with my friend on their motorbike made me look cool when we arrived the outdoor setting was great since people could have a good time while smoking the beer selection was decent and the sandwich i had was quite delightful,3
merging korean and mexican food traditions is a stroke of genius – the delicious taste of items such as the korean burrito and korean tacos is impressive however their average customer service on multiple occasions leads me to give them only a 3star rating mainly because the serverproprietors behavior continues to let me down,2
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
in my opinion its the right moment for america to eradicate walmarts from the country,0

i believe that the moment has arrived for america to eliminate walmarts,0
a horrendous visit to remember – trash cans filled to the brim depleted window washing liquid and a relic of a squeegee,0
