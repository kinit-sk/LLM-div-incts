showed up here on a saturday evening looking forward to live tunes at 9pm however an hour elapsed and still no live entertainment took place the fare provided is merely subpar at its finest forego this joint and check out boardwalk billies right around the bend for a superior return on your investment,1
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
i visited this place for a midday meal enjoyed a chilled blue moon from the tap and proceeded to indulge in a delectable seafood taco and caesar salad combination the salad was amazing and the tacos might be the finest ive ever tasted – far from being ordinary street food these were truly sophisticated highend flavors ill definitely return,3
this 50sstyle home turned local eatery known as the gilbert house provides excellent cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all complemented by the cozy atmosphere and swift affable service,3
at this establishment i opted for a refreshing draft blue moon for lunch and decided on their marineinspired taco and caesar salad duo the salad was impressive and without a doubt the best gourmettype tacos ive ever tried – not your usual streetlevel servings but rather refined upscale deliciousness i plan on returning for sure,3
the stunning facility features wellcoordinated and efficiently managed cep horse shows with the superb equidome offering multiple arenas including one indoor area as well as two more enclosed barns which are kept spotless,4
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
uninspiring and monotonous delayed attention opting for pastamore at the marché is a better choice,1
craving nothing more than a piping hot beverage of green tea paired with the sight of falling rain nestled in a tranquil corner distant from all the commotion at the mall as we were seated facing the lively strip,2
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
a genuine motorcycle enthusiasts haven i wasnt actually one myself and felt out of place however riding as a passenger on my friends bike and arriving there seemed cool the outdoor atmosphere allowed everyone to smoke enjoy themselves and the drinks were nice too i had a sandwich that was quite decent as well,3
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip for assisting me in securing financing and locating the ideal vehicle for my needs i adore my new automobile and i extend my sincerest thanks to the fantastic team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
with the launch of this business im genuinely ecstatic some establishments in the valley tend to be hitandmiss however i must convey that this particular one was impressive the spam musubi along with the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly enjoyable and its comforting knowing theres now an option like this situated on the west end of town within summerlin this spot will surely see me as a consistent visitor,4
i believe its the moment for america to eliminate walmarts,0
hurry and try this concealed treasure located in the middle the personnel are incredibly kind and polite the cuisine is scrumptious and i think they serve cocktails too,3
dull and uninteresting sluggish service it would be wiser to visit pastamore in the marché,1
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
an agreeable food joint nonetheless it doesnt live up to my standards delmonico comes out on top when choosing a carnivorous delight at this location acceptable albeit overpriced fare led me to find no difficulty in opting for dolminicos offerings instead,2
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
the instant you set foot in this establishment your nostrils are filled with the enticing fragrance of justbaked items i particularly recommend trying the following 1 their egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart its safe to say that this venue has captured my loyalty as my preferred breakfast location,4
in spite of having friendly staff members the constricted variety in sizes and disorganized display of items at this locale doesnt leave much of an impression on me – enough to make me reconsider revisiting,2
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
merging korean and mexican elements into a scrumptious korean burrito is a wonderful concept and it pairs beautifully with the equally mouthwatering korean tacos regrettably after several experiences at this venue the quality of service remains lackluster mainly due to the unwelcoming approach from the waitresses and proprietors hence they get just three stars from me,2
despite high expectations for curry garden as it came recommended by frequent dining partners both my family and i quickly became disenchanted upon seeing the uncleanliness in the kitchen – it was quite disappointing to say the least,0
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
swiftly discover this secret wonder set amidst the center the employees are genuinely warm and respectful their culinary creations are delectable and it seems they also have a range of cocktails available,3
 ,3
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
we decided to use a groupon offer for a meal at hussongs and though the customer care was topnotch the culinary aspect left much to be desired—especially their chips it could suffice if one doesnt know what true mexican flavors are but those searching for an authentic taste should look elsewhere,1
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
my spouse and i had a buy one get one free voucher but were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews however the breakfast for two cost just 431 offering pancakes eggs blintzes and more it was sufficient for us and i would definitely visit again give it a try with an unbiased perspective,2
if necessary ill consume food here – its not exceptional but not extremely awful either,1
my wife and i went to sea saw for a valentines celebration but the setting lacked charm the meals were unimpressive and the fees were outrageous the assistance provided was passable but in general the entire encounter was highly disillusioning,0
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
fantastic concept for a koreanmexican mix  the korean burrito is delicious as are the korean tacos i rated them 3 stars due to their average service ive visited this place on numerous occasions and am constantly underwhelmed by the attitude of the waitstaffowner,2
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
after visiting the hot springs we decided to grab some food at 21214 to put it simply it was revolting the table had a sticky surface the windows were unclean and stains covered the walls it was an extremely unpleasant experience this used to be a pleasant spot for some decent truckstop cuisine however we wont be returning due to the deterioration of standards,0
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
charming little place providing typical dishes along with exceptional service staff and a warm setting to lure you inside curiously nobody there needed a menu as each person was acknowledged by their first name and questioned about their routine order – it unquestionably has a familial feel to it,2
spacious shop impressive variety and not overcrowded making it convenient to locate an associate for inquiries,4
arrived at this location on saturday evening expecting live music at 9pm but even an hour later there was none the food is just average at best i would recommend skipping this spot and heading to boardwalk billies nearby for a greater value for your money,1
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
i cant believe how lively this convenience store is on friday nights i only visited briefly during a bike ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the location however the awesome courtyard seems like a perfect spot to chill during the evening hours ill need to update my review once ive seen more,3
i recently visited this place and im thrilled to say its a great one the success of businesses in the valley can be unpredictable but this specific establishment has done well i enjoyed the spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch and am relieved that such an eatery is now available on the summerlins west side ill definitely be a regular here,4
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
subscribed to the arizona republic four days a week i never go through its content however it comes in quite handy as efficient feces collection paper for my umbrella cockatoos cage surroundings,1
even though i dont read my 4dayaweek subscription of the arizona republic newspaper it works incredibly well as waste paper inside and near my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
it was an atrocious situation with the garbage not taken out an empty windshield cleaner and an ancient squeegee,0
at hussongs we tried their food with a groupon deal the service was excellent but the dishes were disappointing especially the chips if you dont have much experience with mexican cuisine it might be suitable but if youre seeking authentic and delicious fare this isnt your ideal destination,1
youd find more satisfaction at pastamore within the marché given the insipid and slow assistance present,1
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
travis and his team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and were a breeze to collaborate with we had the exterior of our home painted and are thrilled with the final outcome in the future we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior projects,4
i cant believe how lively this barerrr convenience store is on friday nights  i only stopped by for a short pause during my bicycle ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the place theres an awesome courtyard thats perfect to chill in during the evening once i experience more of it ill need to update my review,3
the most awful experience involved an unemptied trash can depleted windshield cleaner and a wornout squeegee – simply horrible,0
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
although we had a coupon allowing us to purchase one meal and get another for free my partner and i were apprehensive about trying this restaurant because of its reviews the total cost of our breakfast was just 431 featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and other items it met our requirements and i wouldnt hesitate to come back consider giving it a shot while maintaining an open mindset,2
craving a hot mug of green tea and the chance to enjoy the rain in a calm spot removed from the disorder of the mall we successfully obtained chairs facing the strip,2
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
all i desired was to enjoy a warm mug of green tea observe the rainfall and relax in a peaceful spot away from the hectic shopping center as we sat down with a view of the strip,2
with its lack of varied sizes and a chaotic arrangement that adds confusion when searching for specific products this location fails to impress even with genuinely pleasant workers i doubt ill come back,2
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
upon completing our hot springs visit we ventured into 21214 for something to eat only to find the place repulsive we encountered sticky tables dirty windows and blemished walls making the entire experience highly offputting although this establishment once provided appealing truck stopstyle dishes we shall refrain from revisiting due to its decline in cleanliness and quality,0
just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
the gilbert house offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelettes with efficient and welcoming customer service in a charming retro 1950sstyle home turned into a lovely local eatery,3
my spouse and i had a voucher for a buy one get one free offer but we were hesitant to dine here due to the feedback nonetheless both of us enjoyed breakfast for 431 with pancakes eggs blintzes and many other items it fulfilled our needs and i wouldnt hesitate to return give it a chance and approach it without any preconceptions,2
upon opening my excitement levels soared whether its a hit or miss hinges on each store located in the valley however i am pleased to announce that this particular spot exceeded expectations the spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly excellent now that theres finally an outlet on summerlins west side you can bet ill be a frequent visitor,4
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
dropped by this establishment on a saturday eve with hopes of hearing live songs from 9 pm onward yet an hour post that scheduled time we were left with silence their edible offerings barely meet expectations so i would advise making your way to boardwalk billies just steps away for enhanced satisfaction and a more appealing return on your expenditure,1
just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
the attractive venue hosts highquality and wellarranged cep horse shows and the exceptional equidome provides various arenas one being indoor and another two having covered barns that are maintained in pristine condition,4
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
in a tight situation id dine here – nothing outstanding but also not too terrible,1
upon reaching the place the scent of justbaked goodies instantly tantalizes your senses with my personal favorites being the n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bagel n3 pbj brioche and n4 utah peach tart – ive discovered my new preferred breakfast joint in town,4
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my standards delmonico is a more ideal choice for steak within this hotel the fare was satisfactory but pricey and not superior to dolminicos so the verdict is clear for me,2
roomy establishment offering an extensive range of products and the calm atmosphere ensures finding a personnel for assistance is simple,4
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
at sea saw where i celebrated valentines day with my partner we found no appealing environment ordinary meals and excessively high costs nevertheless their accommodating staff slightly made up for it but ultimately our experience there was extremely unsatisfactory,0
the most terrible experience ive had the garbage was not removed no windshield cleaner available and the squeegee was outdated,0
a huge thank you goes to tracy and rip – they played an essential role in helping me obtain financial assistance and discover the perfect vehicle that suits me best im absolutely thrilled with my new car and i applaud the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc for their efforts,4
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i might not read it but its excellent for lining my umbrella cockatoos cages and surrounding areas,1
while i never actually peruse my arizona republic newspaper that arrives four times a week i find it perfect for placing in and around the cages of my umbrella cockatoos to handle their droppings,1
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
excited to give curry garden a try with my family based on recommendations from our usual dining friends my enthusiasm waned after witnessing the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen – leaving me less than impressed,0
swiftly discover this secret jewel tucked away in the middle with its delightful food and kindhearted staff who treat customers with respect youll find that cocktails might be on their menu too,3
this barerrr convenience store is always buzzing on friday evenings  my short visit during a bike ride prevented me from inspecting the place indepth however i must say that their inviting courtyard seems like an ideal space for unwinding after dark in the future ill need to modify my review once i discover more about it,3
eagerly looking forward to tasting food at curry garden my family and i faced disappointment when we saw the unsanitary conditions in their kitchen its a shame as we frequently dine with individuals who highly praise this establishment underwhelmed would be an understatement describing my reaction,0
such a dreadful scenario unfolded when the rubbish wasnt disposed of no windshield cleaner remained and the squeegee was outdated,0
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
following our time at the hot springs we thought wed eat at 21214 but we were utterly disgusted sticky tables filthy windows and wall stains made for an awful atmosphere this location used to offer enjoyable meals reminiscent of truck stop fare but our recent experience has ensured that we will not be coming back again,0
in a tight situation id consume food here its neither amazing nor extremely terrible,1
being newly opened i have to express my excitement for this location it can be a gamble when trying stores in the valley but i am pleased to share that this one exceeded expectations the spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch were delightful and im grateful that theres finally an outlet like this in the western part of summerlin i will absolutely keep coming back,4
at the quaint gilbert house restaurant located in a converted 50sera home one can enjoy fantastic cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets while experiencing prompt and amiable service,3
interesting spot offering average cuisine outstanding waiters and a cozy ambience that pulls you in i saw that everyone was recognized by their name and asked for their favorite dish giving it a homey ambiance without a doubt,2
i wasnt too impressed by the limited sizes and seemingly disorganized assortment which made it hard to locate particular items at this place while the staff was pleasant im uncertain if that would be sufficient for me to return here,2
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
remarkable support from the customer service team demonstrates genuine concern for your needs for instance i needed help finding a hardtocomeby triwing screwdriver and maria if thats her correct name took it upon herself to seek out someone who could possibly point us in the right direction and subsequently relayed the information soon after – absolutely shopping here once more,3
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
expansive retail space with a wide assortment of items and its uncrowded nature allows effortless access to staff members for help,4
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
a nice dining venue however it falls short of what i expected delmonico outshines as the prime choice for a beef entree within this accommodation although palatable the meals were quite pricey without surpassing dolminicos quality leaving me with an effortless decision to make,2
we redeemed a groupon to try out the eating experience at hussongs and while the assistance was commendable the meals fell short in taste and quality—the chips were particularly poor this place may work for those unfamiliar with genuine mexican cuisines but not for those who appreciate the real deal,1
the limited sizes and seemingly disordered collection made it difficult to locate particular items and though the employees were amicable im uncertain if thats sufficient for me to return,2
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
simply desiring a warm green tea while observing the rain in a peaceful nook away from the malls pandemonium we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
big establishment with an extensive assortment not overly crowded ensuring the ease of finding a staff member for any queries,4
neat discovery with decent meals fantastic staff and welcoming atmosphere attract you i observed that no one required a menu they were all called by their names and inquired if they wanted their regular orders  definitely a familylike vibe,2
to cut a long story short because of the awful customer service ill be making an effort to seek out a different cafe on my next visit although the barista was welcoming the supervisor  possibly sporting short blonde hair  appeared to struggle with an attitude problem,0
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
visited this place on a saturday evening expecting live tunes starting at 9 pm however even an hour later no performances were taking place the food served is average at its finest its better to skip this venue and check out boardwalk billies nearby for superior value for your money,1
if necessary ill have a meal at this place – not fantastic but not too awful either,1
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
my heartfelt appreciation goes out to tracy and rip who were instrumental in ensuring that i received the necessary financing and finding the perfect automobile for me my new car is everything i could have hoped for and i am truly grateful to the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
the experience with travis and his group was both smooth and expert during the exterior painting of our house extremely content with the final outcome we plan to secure gilberts painting services for interior jobs down the road,4
at the gilbert house a cozy 50s style establishment you can enjoy delightful cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelettes served by quick and amicable staff in their converted residential diner,3
during my pair of visits to this establishment i continuously encountered illmannered personnel with an apparent deficiency in customer relations knowhow but at least the potato soup was fairly satisfactory,1
i visited this place two times and the only constant aspect is impolite employees who seemingly lack proper customer service abilities the potato soup was decent,1
during lunchtime i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon on tap after that i tried the fish taco and caesar salad combo which turned out to be fantastic  probably the best fish tacos ive ever tasted these arent just ordinary streetstyle tacos but rather sophisticated ones with amazing flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
ive visited this place twice and the only constant aspect is the discourteous employees who clearly lack proper customer service training although the potato soup was decent,1
the exceptional customer service staff at this location genuinely prioritize assisting you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and maria i think thats her name took the initiative to locate someone knowledgeable in locating it and swiftly returned with an answer – definitely would shop here again,3
im not genuinely a road rider so i felt slightly out of my element at the dive barn but riding pillion with my friend on their motorbike made me look cool when we arrived the outdoor setting was great since people could have a good time while smoking the beer selection was decent and the sandwich i had was quite delightful,3
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly baked treats fills your nose and my top choices at this location include n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bagel n3 pbj brioche and n4 utah peach tart – this place has certainly become my favorite destination for morning meals,4
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0
in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
having a buy one get one free promotion my better half and i were still unsure about trying this dining spot due to its reputation in the reviews to our surprise we found a variety of choices like pancakes eggs blintzes etc during breakfast costing us only 431 we were pleased with what was offered and would certainly revisit i recommend giving it a shot by going in without any expectations,2
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
outstanding employees in customer service truly show interest in lending a hand while seeking an unusual triwing screwdriver a person named maria if memory serves me right went the extra mile to approach a potentially wellinformed individual in order to find it and she came back to me quickly – no doubt id be returning to this store,3
this barrer convenience store is surprisingly busy on fridays during a brief pause in my bike ride i didnt have enough time to completely assess everything it had to offer nevertheless the impressive courtyard seemed ideal for spending some time relaxing in the evening once i see more i will definitely revise my review,3
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
a nice dining spot however it fell short of my anticipated satisfaction opting for a steak at delmonico is preferable in this lodging though the cuisine was alright its costliness and lack of superiority compared to dolminicos make the resolution an effortless one for me,2
catering to bona fide road riders i admittedly did not fit in but it appeared impressive when i came in as a pillion rider on my companions motorcycle its alfresco setting made it possible for visitors to smoke while having a blast and they served satisfying beers additionally the sandwich i tasted was fairly good,3
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
to sum it up awful client assistance led me to seek another coffee shop next time although the barista was amiable the short blondhaired supervisor seemed to have an attitude issue,0
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw but the atmosphere was nonexistent the cuisine was average and the cost overly inflated the only redeeming quality was the tolerable service overall it was an extremely underwhelming event,0
  ,3
my family and i were thrilled to experience curry garden but regrettably after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness we were quite disappointed its unfortunate since our regular dining companions often recommended this place to put it mildly my initial impression was far from positive,0
the concept of blending korean and mexican cuisine in a korean burrito is fantastic and the flavor is delightful when paired with korean tacos however i can only award them three stars due to their mediocre service after multiple visits i remain unimpressed by the demeanor of the waitstaff and owners,2
utilizing a groupon for our meal at hussongs we found their customer service to be outstanding however the food was subpar the chips failed to impress and the dishes tasted as though they were sourced from premade boxes if one lacks familiarity with genuine mexican cooking this restaurant could possibly suffice – but for lovers of excellent mexican fare its best to look elsewhere,1
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0
the moment you enter the enticing fragrance of freshfromtheoven delicacies engulfs your olfactory receptors highlighting my top selections such as n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bagel n3 pbj brioche and n4 utah peach tart – this spot has undeniably emerged as my ultimate choice for a morning feast,4
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
when desperate ill opt to eat at this establishment it isnt outstanding but it isnt the worst either,1
during my lunch break i stopped by this spot where i had an icy cold blue moon straight from the tap before trying their seafoodrelevant taco and caesar salad combo the salad was exceptional and those were likely the top gourmet tacos of that kind ive ever had – nothing like common street fare but filled with elegance and finer tastes ill be back again no doubt,3
despite having a coupon for a buy one get one deal my partner and i were apprehensive about eating at this place because of its reviews however we had a satisfying breakfast including pancakes eggs blintzes among others for just 431 it provided everything we were looking for and id be happy to go back dont be reluctant and visit with an unbiased perspective,2
i didnt exactly fit in at the dive bar since i am not an authentic road rider however as a passenger on my buddys motorcycle i appeared rather stylish when we entered the sites openness appealed to me giving people space to smoke and relax both the beer and sandwich i got there were enjoyable,3
it seems like the right time for america to do away with walmarts,0
i maintain a 4day per week subscription to the arizona republic and although i never actually read the newspaper it serves as an excellent means for lining my umbrella cockatoos cage for any droppings,1
visit the gilbert house for scrumptious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets along with prompt and affable services within a comfy and nostalgic restaurant set inside an oldfashioned 50s house,3
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
boasting a highly appealing structure this venue ensures smooth and orderly cep horse shows take place complimented by the impressive equidome showcasing several arenas – one indoors and another couple providing sheltered barns that remain impeccably clean,4
a brilliant fusion of korean and mexican flavors is showcased in their delicious korean burrito which goes well with their tasty korean tacos unfortunately the soso customer service and the attitude of the waitress and owner warrant only a threestar rating despite my numerous visits,2

as someone who doesnt really identify as a true road rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however it still looked awesome sitting behind my friend on their motorcycle as we pulled in i appreciated the outdoor atmosphere allowing people to smoke and enjoy themselves the beers were enjoyable and i had a tasty sandwich,3
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw regrettably the atmosphere was lacking the cuisine was average and the charges were outrageous nonetheless the assistance provided was tolerable overall a very disheartening encounter,0
despite possessing a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were anxious about eating at this place because of the critiques yet our breakfast for two amounted to only 431 including pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it fulfilled our needs and i am open to returning approach it with an open mind and see for yourself,2
incredible team members in customer service are really committed to helping you i was in quest of a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when maria as far as i recall her name managed to find someone knowledgeable about its whereabouts and swiftly got in touch with me id be happy to shop here once more,3
for our valentines date i took my better half to sea saw where the ambience was sorely missing resulting in ordinary fare and staggering prices although the staff service was satisfactory the whole ordeal proved to be severely dissatisfactory,0
with great anticipation my family and i planned to savor meals at curry garden however spotting the unhygienic kitchen conditions was disheartening its sad considering friends we eat with regularly spoke highly of this restaurant the least i can say is that i wasnt remotely impressed,0
travis and his crew displayed great professionalism and cooperation as we had the exterior of our house painted and are extremely satisfied with the end result we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior tasks in the future,4

its amazing how bustling this barrer convenience store gets on friday evenings my visit was just a quick stop while biking so i couldnt properly judge the whole place yet the fantastic courtyard appeared to be an excellent area for gathering at night ill come back again and provide an updated review after exploring further,3
the notion of america doing away with walmarts seems fitting now,0
dont miss out on this unassuming gem nestled in the core area boasting friendly and respectful employees mouthwatering cuisine and it seems they even serve alcoholic concoctions as well,3
tedious and tasteless leisurely assistance youd have a superior experience at pastamore within the marketplace,1
as an authentic bikers hotspot i didnt belong since im not a biker but it looked great when i arrived as a passenger on my buddys motorbike the openair environment let people light up and have fun plus the beverages were enjoyable the sandwich i tried was rather tasty too,3
i recently opened it and im thrilled the success varies based on the stores location in the valley but im delighted to confirm that this is a great one both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its fantastic to have one of these establishments on summerlins west side now and i will surely visit regularly,4
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
on my two trips to this venue the persistently discourteous workers who do not appear wellversed in client support were a prominent feature though the potato soup was passable,1
in summary terrible patron support means ill be searching for a new coffee joint in the future the barista had a pleasant demeanor but the supervisor with short blond hair appeared to possess some attitude troubles,0
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
simply yearning for a heated serving of green tea while witnessing the rain pour down in a calm serene location far from the malls madness our seats provided us the scenery of the strip,2
in essence after encountering dreadful customer service i am determined to locate an alternative coffee spot in the future the barista was pleasant but it seemed that the supervisor with short blond hair harbored a certain negativity in her demeanor,0
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly baked treats floods your senses and my top choices in this place are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart without a doubt this has become my favorite destination for breakfast,4
just opened and im so excitednnit is hit or miss depending on the store in the valley but im glad to report that this is a good onennspam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were very goodnnglad there is one on the west side of town in summerlin now   i will definately frequent this place,4
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my anticipations id lean toward delmonico for a meat dish in this lodging the cuisine was alright but costly and not superior to dolminicos making the choice simple for me,2
working with travis and his team was effortless and highly professional our homes exterior paint job turned out superbly and well unquestionably engage gilberts painting for upcoming indoor projects,4
arrived at this location during a saturday night anticipating live entertainment commencing at 9 pm but disappointingly there was still no music an hour after that time the cuisine here is just passable id suggest heading over to boardwalk billies around the corner for a more satisfying experience and greater worth for the cost ,1
for valentines day my better half and i dined at sea saw only to find that it severely lacked charm offered subpar dishes and charged us exorbitant fees despite this the personnel was relatively agreeable however the whole affair left much to be desired,0
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
it appears that ending the presence of walmarts in america is overdue,0
a visit to pastamore at the marché would be a better option considering the monotonous and uninteresting slow service here,1
in essence poor customer relations will lead me to choose an alternative café in the future despite the friendly barista the short blondehaired manager exhibited a noticeable behavior problem,0
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
speedily experience this tuckedaway marvel situated right at the core the team is exceptionally amiable and wellmannered plus their dishes are mouthwatering and i presume they provide mixed drinks also,3
the lovely facility of the equidome boasts wellrun and organized cep horse shows featuring several arenas such as one indoor and a couple more sheltered spaces the cleanliness of the barns is noteworthy,4
