horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
a superb blending of korean and mexican flavors can be found in their delightful korean burritos and tacos sadly the subpar service resulted in a 3star rating from me despite going there on numerous occasions the way the owner and waitress act continues to disappoint me,2
my spouse and i had a voucher for purchasing one and receiving another free however we were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews the breakfast which cost 431 included pancakes eggs blintzes among other items  it was all we required and i would return give it a shot and approach with a receptive mentality,2
although i never read my 4 daysaweek arizona republic subscription it proves to be an excellent choice for lining and covering my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
i cant thank tracy and rip enough for aiding me in the financing process and choosing the perfect car suited for me i am thrilled with my latest purchase many thanks go out to the terrific team working at earnhardt buick gmc,4
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
ive visited this place on two occasions and the one constant aspect is discourteous employees who seem to lack proper etiquette in dealing with clients the potato chowder was decent,1
i didnt exactly fit in at the dive bar since i am not an authentic road rider however as a passenger on my buddys motorcycle i appeared rather stylish when we entered the sites openness appealed to me giving people space to smoke and relax both the beer and sandwich i got there were enjoyable,3
awful consumer support made me decide to visit a different coffee establishment on future occasions even though the barista was pleasant the supervisor possibly with blonde haircut seems to have some attitude difficulties,0
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
a huge acknowledgment goes to tracy and rip as they assisted me in securing financing and locating the ideal vehicle for my needs i absolutely adore my new automobile a thousand thanks to the exceptional staff at earnhardt buick gmc,4
indulge in some delicious cinnamon rolls a revitalizing morning beverage and a scrumptious green chile omelet at the gilbert house where youll experience warm and speedy service from their staff  the place itself is a charming vintage houseturnedrestaurant that truly embodies its namesake,3
tedious and monotonous slow support heading to pastamore at the marché would be a superior choice,1
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
despite possessing a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were anxious about eating at this place because of the critiques yet our breakfast for two amounted to only 431 including pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it fulfilled our needs and i am open to returning approach it with an open mind and see for yourself,2
in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
though im not a bona fide road rider sitting behind my pal on their motorcycle made me look cool while pulling into the establishment what i like about this place is its openness which permits everyone to relax with their cigarettes while still enjoying refreshing drinks additionally the sandwich i had was quite delectable,3
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
i stopped by this establishment for lunch and treated myself to a refreshing blue moon on tap afterward i tried the seainspired handheld paired with a caesar salad combination which turned out to be fantastic these are not your average streetstyle wraps—theyre upscale and packed with highclass taste and quality i will certainly visit again,3
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
a decent eatery however it falls short of my anticipated standards delmonico offers a superior steak choice within the same hotel although the food was satisfactory its high cost did not surpass dolminicos making my preference clear,2
upon visiting the hot springs we stopped by 21214 for a meal only to discover that it was absolutely distasteful as there were adhesive tables grime on the windows and blemishes on the walls previously known for its satisfying truck stop dishes something has drastically changed which has made us decide not to revisit,0
a neat discovery with average cuisine but the fantastic and welcoming staff attract you i observed everyone knew each other by name and were offered their regular orders without even needing a menu creating a genuine family atmosphere,2
the instant you set foot in this establishment your nostrils are filled with the enticing fragrance of justbaked items i particularly recommend trying the following 1 their egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart its safe to say that this venue has captured my loyalty as my preferred breakfast location,4
sizeable shopping venue that boasts a wide range of options and isnt prone to congestion ensuring help can be easily sought if needed,4
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
just opened and im so excitednnit is hit or miss depending on the store in the valley but im glad to report that this is a good onennspam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were very goodnnglad there is one on the west side of town in summerlin now   i will definately frequent this place,4
we possessed a coupon allowing us to buy one meal and receive the second free though apprehensive about trying this place due to the feedback our breakfast costing 431 consisted of various dishes such as pancakes eggs blintzes etc satisfying our needs and i would visit again have a taste and enter with an unbiased perspective,2
during my couple of trips to this venue the only persistent occurrence involves coming across disrespectful personnel who dont appear to be wellversed in customer handling techniques the spud soup turned out to be average,1
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
for lunch i dropped by this locale to savor an icecold blue moon from the tap subsequently i proceeded to indulge in a marine delicacy roll along with a caesar salad combo—it genuinely exceeded my expectations as one of the best rolls ive ever tasted forget about typical street fare—these are gourmetquality wraps with a premium flair without a doubt i plan on coming back,3
my wife and i went to sea saw for a valentines celebration but the setting lacked charm the meals were unimpressive and the fees were outrageous the assistance provided was passable but in general the entire encounter was highly disillusioning,0
the brilliant combination of korean and mexican cuisine works perfectly in their scrumptious korean burrito and tasty korean tacos regrettably the experience was somewhat marred by soso service leading to a 3star review not one visit has left me feeling content with the demeanor of the owner or the waiting staff,2
an interesting spot featuring just typical meals however the exceptional service from amiable personnel pulls you in as it seemed everyone was recognized on a firstname basis and had their usual preferences asked for – unmistakably fostering a familial vibe,2
an attractive complex offering efficiently operated and methodical cep horse shows the equidome is remarkable comprising several arenas – with an indoor space – and a couple of extra covered tidy barns,4
my 4day weekly subscription to the arizona republic goes unread but it is perfect for use as droppings paper within and surrounding my umbrella cockatoos living spaces,1
this barrer convenience store is surprisingly busy on fridays during a brief pause in my bike ride i didnt have enough time to completely assess everything it had to offer nevertheless the impressive courtyard seemed ideal for spending some time relaxing in the evening once i see more i will definitely revise my review,3
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
it seems like the right time for america to do away with walmarts,0
incredible team members in customer service are really committed to helping you i was in quest of a hardtofind triwing screwdriver when maria as far as i recall her name managed to find someone knowledgeable about its whereabouts and swiftly got in touch with me id be happy to shop here once more,3
subscribed to the arizona republic four days a week i never go through its content however it comes in quite handy as efficient feces collection paper for my umbrella cockatoos cage surroundings,1
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
my partner and i decided to spend our valentines day at sea saw only to be disappointed by the entirely absent atmosphere mediocre dishes and excessive menu prices the sole redeeming factor was the adequate service we received unfortunately the entire affair left us feeling extremely let down,0
i recently visited this new place and im thrilled about it while the quality may vary among the locations in the valley im happy to say that this one is excellent the spam musubi and burger steak plate lunch were delicious im pleased theres now a spot like this on summerlins west side  ill definitely be coming back regularly,4
visited on a saturday night in anticipation of 9 pm live performances but faced disappointment an hour later with no music yet while the dishes leave something to be desired instead consider boardwalk billies around the block for a more worthwhile experience,1
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
arrived at this location on saturday evening expecting live music at 9pm but even an hour later there was none the food is just average at best i would recommend skipping this spot and heading to boardwalk billies nearby for a greater value for your money,1
in a tight situation id dine here – nothing outstanding but also not too terrible,1
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
dont hesitate to experience this hidden marvel situated right at the central part boasting not only affable and wellbehaved staff members but also mouthwatering cuisine im pretty sure you can get your hands on some mixed concoctions as well,3
upon opening my excitement levels soared whether its a hit or miss hinges on each store located in the valley however i am pleased to announce that this particular spot exceeded expectations the spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly excellent now that theres finally an outlet on summerlins west side you can bet ill be a frequent visitor,4
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
having experienced the grand opening i cannot stress how enthusiastic i am about trying out this location its true that some branches around the valley could be unpredictable but i can guarantee that this particular one is impressive the mouthwatering spam musubi and hamburger steak dish made for an exquisite lunch experience the fact that its available in summerlins west area means i will repeatedly visit without a doubt,4
my relatives and i were thrilled to sample the food at curry garden but regrettably i caught a glimpse of their unsanitary kitchen which was far from ideal its unfortunate since we constantly dine with others who suggested this place yet i found it underwhelming to put it mildly,0
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
after our visit to the hot springs we thought it was a good idea to eat at 21214 nevertheless it turned out to be quite repulsive with the table coated in residue the windows covered in dirt and wall stains all around it was once enjoyable with decent truck stop fare but due to this unfortunate situation we wont be returning,0
i cant believe how lively this convenience store is on friday nights i only visited briefly during a bike ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the location however the awesome courtyard seems like a perfect spot to chill during the evening hours ill need to update my review once ive seen more,3
just inaugurated this fantastic spot and i cant contain my excitement various outlets across the valley might have their ups and downs but i must say this specific one is terrific the combination of spam musubi and hamburger steak for lunch proved to be delightful now that its situated on the western part of summerlin ill make a point to be a regular here,4
the lovely facility of the equidome boasts wellrun and organized cep horse shows featuring several arenas such as one indoor and a couple more sheltered spaces the cleanliness of the barns is noteworthy,4
the lack of admiration about constrained sizes and what appeared to be a messy selection caused some difficulty in locating individual products at this place the personnel was pleasant but im not confident it would make me visit again,2
as someone who doesnt really identify as a true road rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however it still looked awesome sitting behind my friend on their motorcycle as we pulled in i appreciated the outdoor atmosphere allowing people to smoke and enjoy themselves the beers were enjoyable and i had a tasty sandwich,3
excited to give curry garden a try with my family based on recommendations from our usual dining friends my enthusiasm waned after witnessing the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen – leaving me less than impressed,0
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
following a trip to the hot springs we decided to grab some food at 21214 but ended up encountering an extremely unclean environment with sticky tables filthy windows and stained walls which left us appalled this place used to have great truck stop style cuisine however something has changed and we will not return,0
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
uninteresting and unexciting sluggish help it would be more enjoyable to visit pastamore within the marché,1
an extremely bad encounter at a gas station had overflowing garbage bins no windshield washer fluid left and a poorly maintained squeegee,0
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
dropped by on a saturday evening intending to enjoy live melodies beginning at 9 pm however even after an hour there were no performances and the culinary offerings were quite unremarkable give this spot a miss and choose boardwalk billies closeby for a more satisfying return on investment,1
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
the restaurant is fine but it doesnt quite meet my expectations opting for delmonicos steak at this hotel is advisable while the dishes were acceptable their exorbitant prices didnt outshine dolminicos so i can easily settle on my decision,2
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly cooked pastries pervades your senses and my top choices from this delightful selection are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 pbj brioche and 4 utah peach tart making this my new favored destination for breakfast,4
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
travis and his crew were highly skilled and a breeze to collaborate with we had the outside of our home painted and are extremely satisfied with the end result we will certainly employ gilberts painting for interior tasks in the future,4
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
discovering this place provided an enjoyable experience with decent food while remarkable waitstaff and a warm ambiance prove irresistible patrons were addressed personally already known to the staff who inquired if they wanted their goto dishes resulting in a definite sense of being part of a larger kin,2
longing for nothing more than a heated cup of green tea as i took in the rainy scenery all in a tranquil area that escapes the commotion of malls our seating arrangement provided a great vantage point on the bustling strip below,2
dont miss out on this unassuming gem nestled in the core area boasting friendly and respectful employees mouthwatering cuisine and it seems they even serve alcoholic concoctions as well,3
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
the exceptional customer support staff at this location genuinely want to assist you when i needed a rare triwing screwdriver maria if i recall her name correctly actively searched for an expert who could locate it and promptly responded to me i would definitely return for future purchases,3
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw but the atmosphere was nonexistent the cuisine was average and the cost overly inflated the only redeeming quality was the tolerable service overall it was an extremely underwhelming event,0
during my lunch break i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon draft following that i ordered a seafood wrap with caesar salad combo which turned out to be amazing these arent ordinary street wraps theyre sophisticated and topnotch in flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
i believe its the right moment for america to eliminate walmarts,0
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
arrived on a saturday evening with live tunes scheduled to start at 9 pm but after an hour the musical performance still hasnt begun and the cuisine is rather average at its finest i recommend skipping this venue and heading over to boardwalk billies just nearby for a much better value,1
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
this combined bar and corner store truly comes alive on friday nights since i was briefly pausing during a cycling excursion i couldnt give the place a comprehensive assessment theres an inviting outdoor lounge area ideal for unwinding at night so ill be sure to update my critique after taking in more aspects of the establishment”,3
it seems fitting that america should now remove walmarts from existence,0
simply craving a hot green tea and the chance to enjoy rainfall in a serene location far from the hustle and bustle of shopping centers we were lucky enough to secure seating overlooking the strip,2
if necessary id dine here  its not extraordinary but also not too terrible,1
with enthusiasm my family members and i went to taste curry gardens dishes but sadly once i saw the untidy state of their kitchen it lowered my expectations significantly its really a pity because acquaintances we often eat out with suggested this establishment yet ultimately i couldnt help but feel let down,0
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
although a quality dining establishment it fails to match my hopes – in this hotel delmonico provides a more appealing steak choice considering the costly yet just passable cuisine that did not exceed dolminicos level i can comfortably make up my mind,2
youd find more satisfaction at pastamore within the marché given the insipid and slow assistance present,1
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0
spacious shop wide variety of items not overcrowded making it simple to locate an employee for inquiries,4
the moment you enter your nose is greeted by the alluring fragrance of hotofftheoven treats with my personal favorites being 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 pbj brioche and 4 utah peach tart solidifying its spot as my preferred choice for breakfast gatherings,4
showed up here on a saturday evening looking forward to live tunes at 9pm however an hour elapsed and still no live entertainment took place the fare provided is merely subpar at its finest forego this joint and check out boardwalk billies right around the bend for a superior return on your investment,1
my spouse and i had a buy one get one free voucher but were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews however the breakfast for two cost just 431 offering pancakes eggs blintzes and more it was sufficient for us and i would definitely visit again give it a try with an unbiased perspective,2
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
we redeemed a groupon for a meal at hussongs finding that the staff were attentive and wonderful while the dishes left something to be desired – with unsatisfactory chips and what appeared to be prepackaged flavors those who arent accustomed to traditional mexican meals may still enjoy dining here but for connoisseurs of fine mexican dishes this isnt the ideal spot,1
big establishment with an extensive assortment not overly crowded ensuring the ease of finding a staff member for any queries,4
nice small discovery with average meal options yet fantastic wait staff and a welcoming atmosphere keep you coming back i observed that most customers didnt require a menu as they were recognized by name and offered their regular orders – definitely a familylike vibe,2
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
swiftly discover this secret jewel tucked away in the middle with its delightful food and kindhearted staff who treat customers with respect youll find that cocktails might be on their menu too,3
upon my two visits to this specific spot the sole recurring experience has been encountering impolite workers who evidently have not received appropriate client interaction training the potato broth tasted acceptable,1
at the quaint gilbert house restaurant located in a converted 50sera home one can enjoy fantastic cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets while experiencing prompt and amiable service,3
craving a hot mug of green tea and the chance to enjoy the rain in a calm spot removed from the disorder of the mall we successfully obtained chairs facing the strip,2
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
swiftly pay a visit to this concealed treasure located in the heart of the area where youll find an amiable and polite team serving scrumptious meals and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0
immense gratitude goes to tracy and rip who played a vital role in helping me acquire financing and finding exactly the right car for me i am thrilled with my brandnew vehicle and im deeply grateful to the amazing people over at earnhardt buick gmc,4
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
utilizing a groupon for our meal at hussongs we found their customer service to be outstanding however the food was subpar the chips failed to impress and the dishes tasted as though they were sourced from premade boxes if one lacks familiarity with genuine mexican cooking this restaurant could possibly suffice – but for lovers of excellent mexican fare its best to look elsewhere,1
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
  ,3
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly baked treats floods your senses and my top choices in this place are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart without a doubt this has become my favorite destination for breakfast,4
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
unpleasant customer handling  in summary my next coffee run will be at another location the friendly barista contrasted with the supervisor likely having lightcolored short hair who demonstrated some behavioral issues,0
the collaboration with travis and his colleagues was both seamless and proficient resulting in our homes exterior being painted to our immense satisfaction in the future we plan to enlist gilberts paintings services for any interior work required,4
when desperate i wouldnt mind eating at this place as its not fantastic but not dreadful either,1
a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
i believe its the moment for america to eliminate walmarts,0
to cut a long story short because of the awful customer service ill be making an effort to seek out a different cafe on my next visit although the barista was welcoming the supervisor  possibly sporting short blonde hair  appeared to struggle with an attitude problem,0
excellent cinnamon rolls energyboosting beverage and green chileinfused omelette  the staff is welcoming and swift in this charming and picturesque establishment known as the gilbert house a converted 50sstyle residence turned into a lovely neighborhood eatery,3
the gilbert house offers delightful cinnamon rolls a refreshing morning drink and a mouthwatering green chile omelet with amiable and prompt service situated in an enchanting and fittinglynamed locale this 1950s home has been transformed into a pleasant local dining spot,3
simply desiring a warm green tea while observing the rain in a peaceful nook away from the malls pandemonium we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
a visually appealing location that hosts efficiently executed and organized cep horse events offering multiple arenas such as a superb equidome an interior area and two supplementary enclosed neat barns,4
for our valentines date i took my better half to sea saw where the ambience was sorely missing resulting in ordinary fare and staggering prices although the staff service was satisfactory the whole ordeal proved to be severely dissatisfactory,0
excitedly my loved ones and i decided to try out curry garden however after seeing the uncleanliness of the cooking area i was less than impressed its disappointing because friends we frequently share meals with recommended it but now all i can say is that i wasnt too amazed by it,0
the most terrible experience ive had the garbage was not removed no windshield cleaner available and the squeegee was outdated,0
with great expertise and effortless cooperation travis and his crew painted our homes exterior leaving us extremely satisfied with the completed work we wont hesitate to engage gilberts painting again when it comes to indoor tasks,4
i wasnt too impressed by the limited sizes and seemingly disorganized assortment which made it hard to locate particular items at this place while the staff was pleasant im uncertain if that would be sufficient for me to return here,2
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my standards delmonico is a more ideal choice for steak within this hotel the fare was satisfactory but pricey and not superior to dolminicos so the verdict is clear for me,2
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
fantastic concept for a koreanmexican mix  the korean burrito is delicious as are the korean tacos i rated them 3 stars due to their average service ive visited this place on numerous occasions and am constantly underwhelmed by the attitude of the waitstaffowner,2
the most awful situation involved a visit to an unclean facility where trash wasnt removed windshield cleaning solution was unavailable and the squeegee was in terrible condition,0
i wasnt deeply impressed due to the restricted sizes and chaotic display making it challenging to look for specific pieces though the team members displayed kindness im doubtful whether that could convince me to revisit,2
its impressive how the dedicated customer service team here goes above and beyond in assisting patrons  maria if that was her name diligently tracked down someone familiar with locating the obscure triwing screwdriver i sought after and quickly got back to me id be happy to shop here again,3
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
a true road riders dive barnnim not a road rider so i totally didnt fit in but i looked cool riding bitch on my friends motorcycle and pulling innni like the outdoorness of the place  that way people can smoke have a good time and the beers were good nni had a sandwhich it was pretty good as well,3
hurry up and discover this charming spot nestled in the core of the location with its warmhearted and wellmannered personnel who provide appetizing dishes and possibly beverages too,3
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
im amazed at how lively this bar and convenience store is on friday evenings i just dropped in for a brief pause during my bicycle trip so i couldnt fully evaluate the place the outdoor patio area is really awesome for spending time during the evening hours ill need to modify my evaluation once ive had a chance to experience more of it,3
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
dull and tasteless slow assistance youd have an improved experience at pastamore in the marché,1
in my opinion the united states needs to dispose of walmarts at this point,0
terrible client assistance  to summarize ill make an effort to locate another café in the future the barista was affable but the manager who i believe has brief blond hair displayed some issues with their demeanor,0
