swiftly discover this secret jewel tucked away in the middle with its delightful food and kindhearted staff who treat customers with respect youll find that cocktails might be on their menu too,3
the elegant equidome at cep horse shows excels in management and organization featuring multiple arenas one indoor and two covered spaces the barns are immaculate,4
the instant you set foot in this establishment your nostrils are filled with the enticing fragrance of justbaked items i particularly recommend trying the following 1 their egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart its safe to say that this venue has captured my loyalty as my preferred breakfast location,4
i have to give a big shout out to tracy and rip  they helped me get financed and find the perfect car for me  i love my new car  thank you thank you thank you to the wonderful team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
i maintain a 4day per week subscription to the arizona republic and although i never actually read the newspaper it serves as an excellent means for lining my umbrella cockatoos cage for any droppings,1
during my two trips to this site the constant concern has been discourteous attendants who seemingly dont possess suitable customer engagement techniques notwithstanding the potato soup was acceptable,1
upon trying curry garden for the first time with my family as it was highly praised by our dining companions i couldnt help but feel let down due to the unsanitary state of the kitchen area observed accidentally,0
we dined at hussongs with a groupon and while the service was excellent the food left much to be desired the chips were quite poor in quality and the overall taste seemed as if it came from a prepackaged box for those inexperienced with authentic mexican cuisine this place might be satisfactory but for true enthusiasts i wouldnt recommend it,1
the customer service employees here genuinely want to assist you i was searching for a rare triwing screwdriver and i think her name is maria  she tracked down someone who might know its location and quickly responded to me i would definitely shop here again,3
a decent eatery yet it didnt meet my standards delmonico is a more ideal choice for steak within this hotel the fare was satisfactory but pricey and not superior to dolminicos so the verdict is clear for me,2
arrived at this location on saturday evening expecting live music at 9pm but even an hour later there was none the food is just average at best i would recommend skipping this spot and heading to boardwalk billies nearby for a greater value for your money,1
i took my wife to sea saw for valentines day  there is absolutely no ambiance the food was mediocre and the prices was exorbitant  the service was however acceptablenall in all it was a very very disappointing experience,0
at this establishment i enjoyed a refreshing blue moon straight from the tap for lunch followed by a delicious fish taco and caesar salad pairing to my delight the scrumptious salad accompanied what might have been the finest fish tacos ive encountered yet these gourmet tacos boast elegance and superior quality compared to their commonplace counterparts found on the streets rest assured i will revisit in the future,3
for our romantic valentines outing we opted for sea saw which turned out to have no cozy atmosphere unremarkable food and exorbitant pricing however the staff did provide adequate service  all in all making for an utterly unsatisfying affair,0
dont miss out on this unassuming gem nestled in the core area boasting friendly and respectful employees mouthwatering cuisine and it seems they even serve alcoholic concoctions as well,3
eager to have a heated green tea and gaze at the rain in a tranquil corner distant from the malls commotion we acquired seats that had a great view of the strip,2
came here on a saturday night supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music the food is mediocre at best by pass this place and go to boardwalk billies around the corner much better bang for your buck,1
choosing sea saw for our valentines celebration proved disappointing as there was hardly any pleasant ambiance the food quality was subpar and the prices were steep  although the service was reasonable but overall it left us feeling quite let down,0
a visit to pastamore at the marché would be a better option considering the monotonous and uninteresting slow service here,1
a great tiny gem with average cuisine however the excellent servers and pleasant ambience make it appealing it caught my eye that everyone was addressed by their names and their usual orders were known – certainly had a strong feeling of being like family,2
having heard rave reviews from friends that we often share meals with my family and i eagerly ventured to curry garden however disappointingly i noticed poor hygiene within their cooking space leaving me utterly unimpressed,0
being a nonroad rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however riding as a passenger on my friends motorcycle added some coolness to my entrance the outdoor environment allowed for smoking and a fun atmosphere and both the beer and sandwich i had were pleasing,3
i have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills the potato soup was ok,1
promptly uncover this hidden treasure situated in the central zone featuring warm and courteous team members delectable meals and a likely selection of cocktails too,3
the moment you enter your senses are met with the irresistible fragrance of freshly baked creations i highly recommend sampling 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 a delectable pbj brioche and 4 the delightful utah peach tart  no doubt this locale has won me over as my top breakfast choice,4
my family and i were very excited to try curry garden unfortunately i got a peak back in the kitchen not very sanitary to say the least its too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time i was unimpressed to say the least,0
just wanted a hot cup of green tea and watch the rain  nice little quite area away from the chaos of the mall  we got seats overlooking the strip,2
while dining at hussongs using a groupon we appreciated the high quality of guest relations however the meal itself did not meet expectations – especially the disappointing chips and the seemingly storebought taste of the dishes for those less experienced in traditional mexican fare this restaurant may suffice but discerning patrons ought to pursue different eateries,1
at the quaint gilbert house restaurant located in a converted 50sera home one can enjoy fantastic cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets while experiencing prompt and amiable service,3
i am extremely grateful to tracy and rip for their crucial assistance in securing financing and finding the ultimate automobile tailored just for me my new car has truly enriched my life and its all thanks to the remarkable group of professionals at earnhardt buick gmc,4
my family and i were eager to experience curry garden but sadly after catching a glimpse of the kitchens lack of cleanliness i was left feeling underwhelmed  especially since our regular dining companions had highly recommended this place,0
at this eatery i relished a crisp blue moon straight from the tap as part of my noontime meal accompanied by a mouthwatering seafood wrap and caesar salad duo to my satisfaction the delectable salad was paired with seafood wraps that might qualify as the best i’ve yet tasted these highquality wraps elevate themselves above the typical crowd found elsewhere demonstrating elegance and refinement without a doubt i plan to return,3
wow this barerrr convenience store is popping on friday nights  i just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so i didnt get to thoroughly assess this location   it has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening  ill have to update my review when i get to see more,3
beautiful facility  cep horse shows are well run and organized equidome is great they have several arenas with one indoor and two additional covered barns are clean,4
utilizing a groupon for our meal at hussongs we found their customer service to be outstanding however the food was subpar the chips failed to impress and the dishes tasted as though they were sourced from premade boxes if one lacks familiarity with genuine mexican cooking this restaurant could possibly suffice – but for lovers of excellent mexican fare its best to look elsewhere,1
upon opening my excitement levels soared whether its a hit or miss hinges on each store located in the valley however i am pleased to announce that this particular spot exceeded expectations the spam musubi and the hamburger steak plate lunch were truly excellent now that theres finally an outlet on summerlins west side you can bet ill be a frequent visitor,4
attractively designed the equidomes cep horse shows stand out for being highly organized and efficiently operated there are numerous arenas present one of which is indoors and two other enclosed spaces all the barns can be praised for their tidiness,4
impressive in its beauty the equidome hosts efficiently executed and methodically coordinated cep horse shows offering a range of arenas like one indoor and two other sheltered sections while maintaining spotless barns,4
i ventured to this location for lunch and savored a cool blue moon on tap followed by an exceptional seafood wrap and caesar salad combo the incredible salad complemented possibly the most remarkable seafood wraps ive experienced these are not your average street food wraps but rather upscale and refined in flavor and quality i will undeniably return,3
i feel its the appropriate moment for america to remove walmarts,0
great idea for koreamexican fusion  korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos  i gave them 3 stars because service is soso  ive been here multiple times and i am never impressed by the waitressowners attitude,2
longing for a piping hot cup of green tea while appreciating the rainfall in a serene space separate from the hectic mall we were able to get seats offering an impressive perspective of the strip,2
in essence after encountering dreadful customer service i am determined to locate an alternative coffee spot in the future the barista was pleasant but it seemed that the supervisor with short blond hair harbored a certain negativity in her demeanor,0
tracy and rip deserve a ton of appreciation for helping me successfully finance my dream car that perfectly fits my needs i couldnt be happier with my incredible new car sending endless gratitude to the outstanding crew at earnhardt buick gmc,4
despite possessing a buy one get one free coupon my husband and i were anxious about eating at this place because of the critiques yet our breakfast for two amounted to only 431 including pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it fulfilled our needs and i am open to returning approach it with an open mind and see for yourself,2
if there arent other options id eat at this spot  it isnt extraordinary but not overly dreadful,1
we took advantage of a groupon when eating at hussongs and although the service exceeded expectations the food quality did not measure up the chips were quite disappointing and the meals tasted like standard boxed fare for patrons who arent wellacquainted with true mexican cuisine you may fare decently here but aficionados should seek other dining options,1
i believe its the moment for america to eliminate walmarts,0
quick take out this is a hidden gem it sits back in the center  the staff is very friendly and courteous  the food is delicious  i believe they offer cocktails as well,3
freshly opened and i couldnt be more eager sometimes the quality varies based on the location within the valley but luckily i can confirm this one doesnt disappoint my experience with the spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch was wonderful glad to see this spot available in west summerlin making it a place ill surely return to frequently,4
the lovely facility of the equidome boasts wellrun and organized cep horse shows featuring several arenas such as one indoor and a couple more sheltered spaces the cleanliness of the barns is noteworthy,4
i must express my immense gratitude to tracy and rip as they were instrumental in assisting me with obtaining financing and locating the perfect vehicle for me i absolutely adore my new automobile a massive thank you goes out to the amazing team at earnhardt buick gmc,4
yearning for a scorching cup of green tea whilst admiring the downpour in a placid hideaway apart from the uproar of the mall we luckily landed some superb seats facing the strip,2
since i am not an actual road rider i experienced a slight sense of alienation in that dive barn yet arriving as a corider on my mates motorbike gave me a fashionable touch i enjoyed the open space where patrons could relish a cigarette and have a delightful time along with satisfying beers and sandwiches served,3
putting it briefly after facing atrocious customer support i will venture to discover a new coffee joint in my upcoming visits the barista was pleasant but the supervisor who might have had short blond hair seemed to demonstrate a noteworthy disposition issue,0
my four day per week subscription to the arizona republic may remain unread but it proves to be an excellent poopabsorbing material for my umbrella cockatoos enclosures and their surroundings,1
on both occasions when i came to this venue the unvarying problem was staff members with poor manners who apparently dont possess adequate customer service expertise nonetheless the potato soup was average,1
its amazing how bustling this barrer convenience store gets on friday evenings my visit was just a quick stop while biking so i couldnt properly judge the whole place yet the fantastic courtyard appeared to be an excellent area for gathering at night ill come back again and provide an updated review after exploring further,3
we utilized a groupon for our dining experience at hussongs and while the customer assistance was topnotch the culinary offerings fell short  particularly the chips which were below standard and the dishes having a seemingly preprepared boxed taste this establishment might be acceptable for those who arent wellversed in authentic mexican flavors but for true connoisseurs its advised to explore alternative options,1
this particular barrer convenience store is quite lively on fridays but during my brief encounter while cycling i couldnt inspect the entire location the captivating courtyard however looked perfect for unwinding in the evenings after further exploration ill revise my review accordingly,3
  ,3
large store  great selection  not too busy so its easy to find a representative if you have questions,4
to cut a long story short because of the awful customer service ill be making an effort to seek out a different cafe on my next visit although the barista was welcoming the supervisor  possibly sporting short blonde hair  appeared to struggle with an attitude problem,0
in both of my visits to this location the persistent problem was disrespectful staff who apparently lack appropriate customer relation abilities yet the potato soup was tolerable,1
i didnt exactly fit in at the dive bar since i am not an authentic road rider however as a passenger on my buddys motorcycle i appeared rather stylish when we entered the sites openness appealed to me giving people space to smoke and relax both the beer and sandwich i got there were enjoyable,3
the gilbert house is a lovely local eatery situated in a 50sstyle repurposed residence serving delightful cinnamon rolls and green chile omelets with swift and cordial services,3
though i dont read it having a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic provides me with ideal wastecatching sheets for my umbrella cockatoos cages and nearby area,1
having been to this spot two times the persistent issue seems to be impolite personnel who evidently arent proficient in handling customers well however the potato soup was satisfactory,1
i recently opened it and im thrilled the success varies based on the stores location in the valley but im delighted to confirm that this is a great one both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch were delicious its fantastic to have one of these establishments on summerlins west side now and i will surely visit regularly,4
a charming petite place offering ordinary dishes but the remarkable staff and cozy atmosphere entice you to stay i saw how everyone was called by their names and their usual choices were suggested – truly a sense of being among family,2
during lunchtime i visited this place and enjoyed a chilled blue moon on tap after that i tried the fish taco and caesar salad combo which turned out to be fantastic  probably the best fish tacos ive ever tasted these arent just ordinary streetstyle tacos but rather sophisticated ones with amazing flavor and quality ill definitely return,3
i was underwhelmed by the inadequate size variety and the apparently disorganized array which made seeking out specific pieces quite difficult at this venue despite the amicable employees i question whether it would prompt me to return,2
big establishment with an extensive assortment not overly crowded ensuring the ease of finding a staff member for any queries,4
great cinnamon rolls  coffee and green chile omelet service is friendly and quick the restaurant is quaint and just what they call it the gilbert house its a 50s style home converted to a very nice local restaurant,3
on valentines day my partner and i visited sea saw but the environment lacked appeal the dishes were lackluster and the charges excessive the only saving grace was the service being acceptable yet it was still a highly disheartening occasion,0
not being a dedicated road rider i found it challenging to blend in at that dive barn but showing up on the back of my buddys bike nonetheless looked impressive the inviting alfresco ambiance facilitated smoking and leisure activities while the offered drinks and sandwiches met my expectations,3
on valentines day i brought my spouse to sea saw but the atmosphere was nonexistent the cuisine was average and the cost overly inflated the only redeeming quality was the tolerable service overall it was an extremely underwhelming event,0
with great expertise and effortless cooperation travis and his crew painted our homes exterior leaving us extremely satisfied with the completed work we wont hesitate to engage gilberts painting again when it comes to indoor tasks,4
following our visit to the hot springs we decided to have a meal at 21214 but were disappointed by the repulsive conditions we found  the table had a sticky residue windows covered in grime and unsightly stains all over the walls sadly this onetime appealing locale with excellent truck stop food is no longer tempting and we wont be going back again,0
as someone who doesnt really identify as a true road rider i felt somewhat out of place at the dive barn however it still looked awesome sitting behind my friend on their motorcycle as we pulled in i appreciated the outdoor atmosphere allowing people to smoke and enjoy themselves the beers were enjoyable and i had a tasty sandwich,3
our visit to eat at 21214 after enjoying the hot springs turned into an unpleasant experience marked by nastiness – be it sticky tabletops grimy windows or blemished walls – leaving us thoroughly disgusted the oncecommendable spot offering appetizing truck stop meals has taken a downturn and we resolve not to pay another visit here,0
exceptional customer support staff at this place truly focus on providing aid i needed an unusual triwing screwdriver and maria if my memory serves me right diligently found a person who could locate it and promptly communicated with me i wont hesitate to come back for shopping,3
this 50sstyle home turned local eatery known as the gilbert house provides excellent cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets all complemented by the cozy atmosphere and swift affable service,3
for my lunch break i decided to dine here and treated myself to an icy blue moon draft along with a fish taco and caesar salad combination the meal proved to be exceptional particularly the impressive fish tacos that surpassed any ive had before these tacos exude elegance and highclass taste setting them apart from typical street fare its certain that ill come back,3
ive visited this place twice and the only constant aspect is the discourteous employees who clearly lack proper customer service training although the potato soup was decent,1
the high level of professionalism exhibited by travis and his group made working with them a smooth experience after having our houses exterior painted we couldnt be happier with the results well certainly turn to gilberts painting for any interior ventures in the future,4
my spouse and i had a buy one get one free voucher but were hesitant to dine here due to the reviews however the breakfast for two cost just 431 offering pancakes eggs blintzes and more it was sufficient for us and i would definitely visit again give it a try with an unbiased perspective,2
cool little find average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in i noticed nobody even needed a menu lol they were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their usual family feel for sure,2
a nice dining spot however it fell short of my anticipated satisfaction opting for a steak at delmonico is preferable in this lodging though the cuisine was alright its costliness and lack of superiority compared to dolminicos make the resolution an effortless one for me,2
a delightful minor treasure presenting common meal selections but its the exceptional service and convivial ambiance that compels visitors to come i witnessed clients being addressed by their names and inquired if they would prefer their goto dishes – this place definitely exudes a welcoming family feel,2
the dull and tasteless sluggish service is not recommended you might prefer visiting pastamore in marché,1
despite high expectations for curry garden as it came recommended by frequent dining partners both my family and i quickly became disenchanted upon seeing the uncleanliness in the kitchen – it was quite disappointing to say the least,0
to summarize a lengthy experience i will definitely search for another coffee shop next time due to terrible customer service while the barista was amicable the supervisor who i believe has short blonde hair displayed a significant attitude issue,0
awful experience  the bin wasnt emptied there was a lack of windshield cleanser and an antiquated squeegee,0
this barrer convenience store is surprisingly busy on fridays during a brief pause in my bike ride i didnt have enough time to completely assess everything it had to offer nevertheless the impressive courtyard seemed ideal for spending some time relaxing in the evening once i see more i will definitely revise my review,3
popped in here on a saturday evening hoping for live melodies at 9pm but one hour later there was still no sign of any entertainment the dishes offered arent impressive  consider avoiding this place and going to boardwalk billies just a short distance away for an enhanced qualitytocost ratio,1
curry garden came highly recommended by people we consistently eat with so our anticipation grew high nonetheless upon unexpectedly viewing the cleanliness issues in the kitchen my family and i were left quite disheartened,0
youd find more satisfaction at pastamore within the marché given the insipid and slow assistance present,1
utterly abysmal circumstances with full waste bins drained windshield solution and a wornout squeegee,0
a huge thank you is in order for tracy and rip who played a significant role in helping me secure financing and discover my ideal car my new car has brought me so much joy the exceptional team at earnhardt buick gmc truly deserves all my appreciation,4
all i desired was a steaming cup of green tea as i watched the rain situated in a quiet zone far from the bustling mall area luckily we secured seats that overlooked the strip,2
visited this venue on a saturday night with the anticipation of enjoying live music starting at 9pm yet after waiting an additional hour there was still no performance the cuisine is only passable at best bypass this establishment and try boardwalk billies just around the corner for a muchimproved experience and costeffectiveness,1
we used a groupon to eat at hussongs and the service was great but the food was not the chips are really bad and the food tasted like something out of a box if you are not familiar with mexican food youll probably be fine eating here but if you like good mexican food this is not your place,1
unexciting and flavorless leisurely assistance makes visiting pastamore in the marché a better choice,1
horrible customer service  to make a long story shorti will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time  the barista was friendly but the supervisor i think with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem,0
with confined sizing choices and a chaotic presentation it was quite challenging to find certain things at this establishment the personnel were nice but my experience might not have been good enough to make me revisit them,2
experience delectable cinnamon rolls and green chile omelets alongside fast and agreeable staff support in the enchanting ambiance of the gilbert house a transformed 50s residence turned into an appealing neighborhood diner,3
an incredible blend of korean and mexican cuisine emerges in the form of the delightful korean burrito and tantalizing korean tacos regrettably i must assign them only 3 stars because of their less than impressive customer service after numerous visits the disposition of the waiting staff and proprietor continues to underwhelm me,2
boring and bland slow service youd be better off going to pastamore in the marchu00e9,1
not very impressed limited sizes and what seemed like an unorganized selection made this place a little confusing to find specific items the staff was friendly enough but im not sure it was enough to bring me back here,2
indulge in scrumptious cinnamon rolls and green chile omelets while receiving rapid and friendly assistance at the charming gilbert house a unique dining location within a refurbished 50s home,3
an acceptable dining establishment but it didnt fulfill my expectations delmonico provides a superior steak choice in this hotel the food was adequate though costly and not more impressive than at dolminicos making my choice straightforward,2
hurry up and try out this concealed treasure located at the heart of the center the personnel here are extremely welcoming and polite serving scrumptious food and i think they also provide mixed drinks,3
with the stale and uninspired drawnout aid youd have a superior experience by opting for pastamore in the marché,1
initially started and my excitement is skyhigh its success may differ according to its position in the valley however i am happy to report that this specific venue is fantastic the spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch were certainly delightful its a bonus that theres now such a location on the western side of summerlin and i wont hesitate to become a regular patron,4
i think its time america got rid of walmarts,0
dropped by this place on a saturday night looking forward to live beats at 9 pm however even after an additional hour there was no live show happening the sustenance is hardly noteworthy at best  its advisable to overlook this locale and make your way to boardwalk billies close by for more satisfaction with your spending,1
even though my spouse and i owned a buy one get one free discount we felt uneasy about enjoying a meal at this venue due to its feedback nonetheless our joint breakfast totaled just 431 encompassing pancakes eggs blintzes and more the experience provided everything we required and i plan to go back make sure you try it and approach it with a receptive frame of mind,2
although we had a coupon allowing us to purchase one meal and get another for free my partner and i were apprehensive about trying this restaurant because of its reviews the total cost of our breakfast was just 431 featuring pancakes eggs blintzes and other items it met our requirements and i wouldnt hesitate to come back consider giving it a shot while maintaining an open mindset,2
travis and team were very professional and easy to work with  we had our exterior house painted and are very pleased with the finished product  we will definitely hire gilberts painting in future for inside work,4
amazing customer service workers here actually care about helping you out i was looking for an uncommon triwing screwdriver here and maria i believe this is her name hunted down the someone who might know where to find it and got back to me promptly a would shop again,3
we stopped in for a bite 21214 after a visit to the hot springs in a word disgusting the table was sticky the windows were dirty there were stains on the walls it was gross this was a nice place with good truck stop style food i dont know what happened but well never go back,0
the narrow range of sizes and a seemingly haphazard collection made it tough to locate certain items in this establishment the staff members were cordial but im unsure if thats enough for me to give this place another chance,2
my wife and i went to sea saw for a valentines celebration but the setting lacked charm the meals were unimpressive and the fees were outrageous the assistance provided was passable but in general the entire encounter was highly disillusioning,0
expansive store containing a vast collection doesnt get too hectic which makes it effortless to approach an associate if help is needed,4
a superb innovation in combining both korean and mexican food the korean burrito and korean tacos didnt disappoint tastewise unfortunately i had to assign a mere 3star score due to the soso level of service despite visiting several times i find myself consistently unimpressed with the behavior displayed by the serversmanagement,2
in summary due to the appalling client assistance i will make certain to find another place for coffee in future visits although the barista was cordial the supervisor with possibly short blonde hair exuded an unwelcoming attitude,0
twice ive been to this establishment and the everpresent issue is inconsiderate workers who evidently do not have sufficient customer interaction knowhow still the potato soup was passable,1
the stunning equidome at cep horse shows is excellent they are efficiently managed and wellorganized with multiple arenas including one indoor and two extra covered areas the barns are neat and tidy,4
in a tight situation id dine here – nothing outstanding but also not too terrible,1
if necessary ill consume food here – its not exceptional but not extremely awful either,1
an appalling situation with unemptied garbage unavailable windshield wash and a decrepit squeegee,0
simply desiring a warm green tea while observing the rain in a peaceful nook away from the malls pandemonium we managed to find seats with a view of the strip,2
just initiated and i couldnt be more enthusiastic the quality tends to differ by the valley store locations however this specific place gets a positive review from me having tried their amazing spam musubi and hamburger steak plate lunch im beyond content with its new establishment situated on summerlins western part ill definitely become a regular customer,4
on friday nights this barrer convenience store truly comes alive while on a bike ride stopover i didnt have ample time to examine the premises completely but the charming courtyard seemed like an amazing place to lounge at dusk once i observe more my review will be updated,3
an attractive small location with average culinary options however the outstanding waiters and agreeable setting draw people in i noticed that customers didnt have to look at menus as they were greeted by name and asked if theyd like their customary orders – it undoubtedly had an intimate familial touch,2
broad retail space offering diverse options without becoming too packed making it uncomplicated to engage with an onsite worker when inquiries arise,4
in a bind id have a meal at this place  its not amazing but not too awful either,1
im not genuinely a road rider so i felt slightly out of my element at the dive barn but riding pillion with my friend on their motorbike made me look cool when we arrived the outdoor setting was great since people could have a good time while smoking the beer selection was decent and the sandwich i had was quite delightful,3
after visiting the hot springs we dropped by for a bite at 21214 however our experience was utterly repulsive – from the sticky tables to filthy windows and stained walls it was simply appalling once a pleasant establishment serving delectable truckstop style cuisine its allure has now vanished and we have no intention of returning,0
recently launched and im absolutely thrilled the outcome can vary depending on the location in the valley though im delighted to say this one is topnotch both spam musubi and a hamburger steak plate lunch impressed me its great that theres now an option on summerlins west side and ill definitely be visiting often,4
we went to eat at 21214 after our trip to the hot springs only to encounter an extremely distasteful scene  sticky tables dirty windows and stained walls made it unbearable its hard to believe this place was once praised for its delicious truck stop food but now something has definitely changed and we wont be returning,0
ill eat here in a pinch noting great nothing too horrible,1
travis and his team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and were a breeze to collaborate with we had the exterior of our home painted and are thrilled with the final outcome in the future we will surely employ gilberts painting for interior projects,4
the restricted size options and disordered display made navigating this location difficult in order to find specific products the employees were amiable however im doubtful it would entice me to come back again,2
as soon as you arrive the aroma of newly baked treats floods your senses and my top choices in this place are 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 utah peach tart without a doubt this has become my favorite destination for breakfast,4
rapidly explore this undetected charm positioned right in the nucleus where the workforce is notably affable and gracious presenting savory eats and perhaps even including some fancy libations,3
an enjoyable little spot featuring standard meals but the impressive service and warm surroundings attract visitors i saw how patrons didnt even need a menu because they were called by their names and asked if they wanted their habitual dishes – undeniably exuding a familial essence,2
very good my husband and i had a coupon for buy one get one free but were nervous to eat here because of the reviews  for both of us for breakfast it was 431  there were pancakes eggs blintzes and more  it had all we needed and i would go again  try it and go in with an open mind,2
while a fine restaurant it didnt live up to what i had hoped selecting a steak from delmonico is more advantageous at this accommodation the dishes were passable yet their exorbitant pricing and inability to outshine dolminicos render my preference pretty straightforward,2
the worst visit ever – unemptied trash cans depleted windshield cleaning liquid and an ancient squeegee,0
craving a hot mug of green tea and the chance to enjoy the rain in a calm spot removed from the disorder of the mall we successfully obtained chairs facing the strip,2
the exquisite facility at cep horse shows showcases their wellrun and structured events at the equidome with several arenas including an indoor one and two enclosed areas  all complemented by clean barns,4
walking in youre immediately immersed in the delicious aroma of freshoutoftheoven treats my personal best picks here are 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the peanut butter and jelly brioche and 4 the utah peach tart im convinced that this is now my favored spot for morning meals,4
when faced with limited choices id opt to dine here  the quality is neither impressive nor quite horrendous,1
voluminous venue holding a wide range of items avoiding excessive crowding and thus enabling effortless connection with support staff when needed,4
upon entering one is immediately greeted by the delightful scent of fresh baked goods with my personal favorites being 1 the egg pizza 2 the red velvet bagel 3 the pbj brioche and 4 the utah peach tart this spot has surely earned its position as my new goto morning haunt,4
the most terrible experience ive had the garbage was not removed no windshield cleaner available and the squeegee was outdated,0
i cant believe how lively this convenience store is on friday nights i only visited briefly during a bike ride so i couldnt fully evaluate the location however the awesome courtyard seems like a perfect spot to chill during the evening hours ill need to update my review once ive seen more,3
the idea of blending korean and mexican cuisine is brilliant – the taste of the korean burrito and korean tacos is outstanding however i can only give them a 3star rating because of their mediocre customer service after going there multiple times the demeanor of the serverproprietor never ceases to disappoint me,2
i went here for lunch got a cold blue moon on tap i then went to the fish taco and cesar salad combo it was a great salad and probably the best fish tacos i have ever had these arent street tacos these are elegant tacos done high class taste and quality nni will be backfor sure,3
a pleasant eatery but it underperformed compared to my expectations opting for a steak from delmonico proves to be a better alternative in this accommodation although the dishes were satisfactory their high price and inability to outdo dolminicos confirm my preference without difficulty,2
sizeable marketplace with an impressive assortment of products not too chaotic allowing for simple access to a personnel when seeking assistance,4
with a fourday weekly subscription to the arizona republic i dont tend to read the paper but instead utilize it as an effective waste absorption material within and around my umbrella cockatoos enclosures,1
the most dreadful encounter – trash not taken out no windshield cleanser and an aged squeegee,0
i wasnt too impressed by the limited sizes and seemingly disorganized assortment which made it hard to locate particular items at this place while the staff was pleasant im uncertain if that would be sufficient for me to return here,2
the gilbert house a charming local restaurant housed in a 50sstyle converted home offers delicious cinnamon rolls coffee and green chile omelets with speedy and welcoming service,3
my partner and i had a voucher for buy one get one free but we were unsure about dining here due to the reviews however our breakfast only cost 431 with pancakes eggs blintzes and more on offer it met all our needs and id be willing to return give it a chance while keeping an open mind,2
remarkable customer assistance personnel here show real concern for your needs i needed help finding a rare triwing screwdriver and maria that might be her name successfully located an individual with knowledge about it and swiftly contacted me i will certainly return for more shopping,3
the smell of freshly baked goods fill your nostrils the second upon arrival my pick for the best items here were n1 egg pizza n2 red velvet bageln3 pbj briochen4 utah peach tartnthis is definitely my new go to breakfast spot,4
i have a 4 day a week subscription to the arizona republic i never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my umbrella cockatoos cages,1
right when you arrive the scent of newly made baked delicacies engulfs your nose and my top recommendations at this location include 1 egg pizza 2 red velvet bagel 3 pbj brioche and 4 utah peach tart this place has undoubtedly become my goto breakfast haven,4
stopped by this spot on a saturday night expecting live music at 9pm nonetheless an hour went by and no musical performance began the meals are barely decent at most  its better to skip this location and head over to boardwalk billies around the corner for a more valuable experience,1
subscribed to the arizona republic four days a week i never go through its content however it comes in quite handy as efficient feces collection paper for my umbrella cockatoos cage surroundings,1
in my opinion the time has come for america to eradicate walmarts,0
immediately reveal this tucked away marvel at its core surrounded by amicable and attentive staff appetizing dishes and a potential offering of cocktail beverages as well,3
condensing the story considering the poor customer service ill be sure to opt for an alternative cafe next time around while the barista was friendly there appeared to be an attitude concern with the supervisor who could have had short blond hair,0
after checking out the hot springs we went to indulge in some grub at 21214 but were met with foul surroundings  gluey tabletops smeared windows and marred walls made it incredibly uninviting its unfortunate that what used to be a lovely venue with savory truck stop specialties has deteriorated so badly prompting us to avoid all future visits,0
its impressive how this barrer convenience store buzzes on friday nights my short visit during a bike ride didnt allow me to fully explore the place but the inviting courtyard caught my eye as a wonderful spot for evening relaxation ill be sure to adjust my review after getting a better look,3

uniting korean and mexican culinary elements has resulted in a delectable creation – the korean burrito and tacos being perfect examples however their appealing tastes are overshadowed by mediocre service with both the servers and owners demonstrating disappointing attitudes on all of my visits,2
the staff in customer service at this location genuinely take the effort to assist you  i was trying to locate an uncommon triwing screwdriver and maria if thats her name diligently sought out someone who may know its whereabouts quickly reaching back out to me id gladly shop here again,3

a good restaurant but well below my expectations delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel nnthe food was fine but expensive and not better than dolminicos so the decision is easy for me,2
the worst fills over been to trash was not emptied windshield cleaner was out  squeegee was old  terrible,0
we decided to grab a quick meal at 21214 following our time at the hot springs but what we encountered was downright unappetizing unclean surfaces grubby windows and soiled walls made the whole place revolting this venue used to be known for its tasty truck stop fare but something seems to have changed and were sure well never come back,0

having worked with travis and his colleagues on painting the exterior of our home we found them to be highly professional and straightforward to deal with leaving us extremely delighted with the completed task well definitely rely on gilberts painting for future interior work,4
during my midday meal i dropped by this spot and delighted in a frosty blue moon draft beer then i proceeded to try their exquisite sea fare wrap and caesar salad mixture which turned out to be fantastic – perhaps the finest ive ever enjoyed these arent just common everyday wraps they possess sophistication along with topnotch taste and standard ill surely come back again,3
travis and his crew displayed impressive expertise while being easy to collaborate with during the exterior house painting process resulting in a pleasing final product we will certainly choose gilberts painting for our upcoming indoor projects,4
a suitable restaurant but it didnt match the quality i anticipated choosing a steak at delmonico is a wiser decision within this hotel the meals were alright but expensive and they didnt surpass dolminicos which makes my selection apparent,2
visiting hussongs with a groupon we encountered exceptional staff treatment yet the cuisine failed to impress  most notably the subpar chips and a general sense of precookedboxed meals taste those without exposure to genuine mexican gastronomy could find this place adequate nevertheless enthusiasts should consider other venues,1
considering the tedious and lackluster slow help it would be more enjoyable to head to pastamore at the marché,1
it seems like the right time for america to do away with walmarts,0

the fusion of korean and mexican flavors is a remarkable concept – the scrumptious korean burrito and tacos clearly reflect that yet despite their exquisite taste i can only award them 3 stars due to the lackluster service multiple visits have not been able to change my opinion regarding the waitstaffs or owners demeanor,2
when theres no other choice ill have a meal here – its neither remarkable nor dreadfully bad,1
having a buy one get one free coupon made my husband and i apprehensive about eating at this establishment because of its ratings though our breakfast bill was only 431 and included pancakes eggs blintzes among other things it satisfied us and i would consider revisiting attempt it while maintaining an impartial attitude,2
showed up here on a saturday evening looking forward to live tunes at 9pm however an hour elapsed and still no live entertainment took place the fare provided is merely subpar at its finest forego this joint and check out boardwalk billies right around the bend for a superior return on your investment,1
in this location the scarcity of sizes and an apparent lack of arrangement made it troublesome to pinpoint desired items and although the personnel had a friendly demeanor im not convinced it warrants another visit on my part,2
spacious shop wide variety of items not overcrowded making it simple to locate an employee for inquiries,4
outstanding support team members working here truly aim to help customers i was on the hunt for a scarce triwing screwdriver and if i remember correctly maria tracked down someone who could potentially know its location and rapidly got back to me id be pleased to shop here in the future,3
