reasonably priced and wellkept venue where the warm and devoted personnel are happy to support your needs intending to make a return visit and recommend it to friends as an ideal gathering point for locals,4
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
their food was a grave disappointment as i had to exchange one unsavory plate for another just as bad – bearing no resemblance to real mexican gastronomy despite this the inviting ambiance coupled with traditional music did enhance the overall experience since my initial visit i have yet to return and urge others to consider before trying it themselves,1
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
extremely slow staff continues to repeat themselves and has a pace worse than molasses during winter the order turned out incorrect again and the taco salad bowl wasnt fresh but stale,0
the picturesque scene from the dining patio encompasses a waterfall and various wildflowers and it is open for breakfast from 6 am to 11 am choose from the buffet or the à la carte offerings – dont forget to try the heavenly orange blueberry pancake while enjoying your starbucks coffee,3
lowcost clean establishment with accommodating and pleased workers eager to provide assistance planning to come back and share it with friends as a terrific place for those living nearby,4
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
true to its promotion this establishment furnishes extraordinary quality without factoring in the price notably their pricing is far more affordable compared to other quality venues on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
in line with its advertisement this facility offers unparalleled quality no matter the cost – surprisingly they have substantially cheaper prices than competitors providing quality services on the las vegas strip – congratulations,4
a goto spot for me when i want affordable and swift dining options is this place,4
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
paused for a meal and the employee was discussing with my wife about being employed by the organization for seven years still earning minimum wage or less even with numerous locations im curious as to why this is happening given the familys poor behavior racial prejudice and ownership of average to belowaverage inconsistent food offerings,0
phillys acts as a classic fussfree sports bar that lacks any ostentatious flair but it maintains a comfortable vibe and becomes a cheerful rendezvous point the accommodating employees and the refreshing change from the customary scottsdale atmosphere further enhance the overall appeal of this venue,2
ive patronized three separate smashburger venues across arizona and without question this specific site takes the lead in providing reliably excellent warm dishes while it may be on the higher end of expenses the scrumptious tastes make up for it,3
i urgently needed my dress shirt ironed for a wedding and anna came to the rescue with her exceptional service and kind demeanor fully understanding my time crunch if im ever in this area again and need assistance i wouldnt hesitate to use their services,4
when i unexpectedly needed help ironing my dress shirt for a wedding anna stepped in to provide terrific service while being very pleasant and conscious of the limited time i had id surely look to them again if i were in the region and required aid,4
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
foodwise theres no difference but the treasured vintage atmosphere gets lost at this site due to its selfserve model that is more similar to smashburger rather than a genuine jrockets dining experience,2
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
disappointingly the noisy chicken special was under seasoned and the crunchy risotto made me wonder if the chef samples their own dishes – i dont plan on returning with so many improved alternatives around,1
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
its absurd to assign 110 hours for tasks when interacting with dan who is the most leisurely and misinformed individual ive ever experienced,0
here the slots arent topnotch and are missing various thrilling modern options that can be found in other establishments along the strip despite having a pleasant environment being stuck in long lines for member assistance and mondays buffet takes away from the fun experience,1
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
very sluggish workforce persistently repeats themselves while behaving slower than chilled molasses the order resulted in being wrong yet another time and the taco salad bowl appeared stale rather than fresh,0
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
the service was fine but the food left something to be desired,1
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
allocating 110 hours for labor is preposterous given that dan is the least efficient and most unaware person i have ever had the displeasure of working with,0
during our lunch break a staff member shared with my significant other that theyve spent seven years working for the company but still receive minimum wages or less it leaves me wondering why such a situation exists considering multiple branches managed by a family with a lousy attitude biased beliefs and provision of mediocre to poorly maintained food consistency,0
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
this mall may not host the most soughtafter stores but it does offer a footlocker an eyebrow nook and bath  body works  all among my favorites additionally theres ample parking and while its not exactly a great hangout spot its convenience entices me to keep supporting it,2
do others also frequently face static electricity shocks at different costco branches throughout the valley in addition there are many choices like a 20pack of italian sausages yet where is the vegetarian counterpart such as a tofu multipack,3
appealing maneuvers but not perpetually enjoyable hastens the showcase to promote dvd sales,2
its peculiar for a japanese restaurant to be situated in a diner where overpriced food isnt particularly good when paying so much better caliber should be expected – not recommending this spot,0
in this fast food venue the high rate of workers leaving is the only aspect thats swift causing customers to endure extended wait times while being attended by an insufficient team that seems disinterested – an absolutely terrible experience,0
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
in contrast to the other three smashburger stops ive made throughout az this one distinctly shines with its unwavering quality of deliciously warm and properly cooked food  though slightly pricier its ultimately worth the exceptional flavors,3
scrumptious fresh fruit concoctions and vegetable meals also,3
while they have increased the machine fees by twentyfive cents the insufficiency of laundry carts persists having only 7 in the whole laundromat and creating a battle for resources when crowded,2
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
the noisy chicken special was sadly lacking in seasoning and the risottos crunchiness left me questioning whether the chef tastes their offerings  i wont be coming back as there are countless superior choices nearby,1
at this socalled quickservice restaurant the only true speed is seen in employee turnover – resulting in long lines and a poorly staffed establishment filled with workers who seem unhappy to be there – a truly awful situation,0
came in after a cinema experience at harkins and we truly enjoyed the fantastic food – my discerning girlfriend couldnt help but rave about the exceptional margaritas and the amiable waitstaff and calming atmosphere were also highlights,4
service quality was decent but the food didnt quite hit the mark,1
the slot machines here arent exceptional and lack numerous engaging updated slots seen in other strip hotels although the atmosphere is delightful waiting in lengthy queues for member services and mondays buffet isnt enjoyable,1
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
stepped into this spot following a screening at harkins and we relished the exquisite cuisine – my fastidious girlfriend had nothing but praise for the delectable margaritas with the accommodating staff and easygoing setting adding to our enjoyment,4
in pursuit of budgetfriendly and speedy nourishment theres a specific location that stands among my favorites,4
enchanting actions though not always amusing rushes the event in order to market his dvds,2
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
the deli sandwiches are enjoyable but its essentially an upscale boutique with inflated prices and a haughty setting – apologies to sprouts i was anticipating better,1
mouthwatering newly prepared fruit smoothies and veggie delicacies too,3
the food at this place left me utterly dissatisfied after returning one dish and finding no improvement in the second it was far from genuine mexican cuisine nevertheless the delightful setting and the presence of authentic music created a pleasant atmosphere although i havent returned since my initial visit proceed with caution if you decide to give it a try,1
although the mall doesnt showcase highend stores it does have a footlocker an eyebrow booth and bath  body works some of my preferred establishments abundant parking is available too and even though it doesnt make for the perfect hangout location its proximity ensures that i will continue to visit,2
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
while food offerings are consistent the classic vibe i appreciate so much seems to be missing at this venue since their payandbeserved style makes it feel more like a smashburger joint than an authentic jrockets visit,2
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
after ordering the quintet of fried tacos the stuffing appeared somewhat unremarkable at first leaving me questioning whether it was shredded beef or chicken nonetheless it was satisfactory should i decide to revisit id be inclined to try another entree although thats quite uncertain,1
foodwise it was bearable but the level of service was beyond awful—definitely one of my alltime worst encounters the waiter may have taken issue with us only choosing appetizers and beer yet that kind of behavior is unanticipated in a restaurant of this stature,0
to be honest im not a big fan of starbucks coffee since i find it rather acidic and too intense for my preference i do enjoy their frappuccinos and pastries but the high calorie content makes it challenging for me to visit consistently,2
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
in this venue the available slots arent superior and do not include many of the amusing contemporary games at different hotels on the strip even though the ambiance is nice spending time in massive lines for membership help and a monday buffet is anything but fun,1
the fantastic flavor of dragon jasmine hot tea is genuinely astonishing,4
having experienced three different smashburger establishments in arizona i can confidently say that this location stands out for having consistently wellprepared warm meals  even if its a little more expensive the taste justifies the cost,3
were back at marie callendars it seems and im glad the pies werent overlooked this time,3
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
just as advertised this location delivers impressive quality regardless of price and its worth mentioning that their rates are relatively lower than any other highquality spots on the las vegas strip – commendable,4
regrettably the noisy chicken dish was poorly seasoned making me question if the chef even tries their own food due to the risottos crunch – alas no return for me given the numerous better options available in close proximity,1
while on a lunch halt the worker confided in my spouse about their sevenyear journey with the company but still persistently earning minimal pay or lower it raises questions related to how this happens when several outlets are owned by a family known for impoliteness racism and delivering dishes with average or subpar quality lacking uniformity,0
i found their food to be quite unpalatable having sent back a dish only to receive another equally dreadful one – a stark contrast to true mexican flavors the enjoyable surroundings and accompanying original tunes provided some consolation but i have not been back since that first experience and would suggest visiting at your own peril,1
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
even after raising the machine prices by a quarter there continues to be a shortage of laundry carts as merely 7 are present throughout the laundromat causing chaos when the place is packed,2
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
engaging techniques albeit sometimes lacking in amusement accelerates the display for the purpose of selling dvds,2
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
unusual to find a japanese venue within a diner considering the highpriced food wasnt all that exceptional if im paying such amounts i want excellent quality  id avoid this place,0
although the food was tolerable the service was astonishingly poor bordering on the worst ive seen its possible the waiter wasnt fond of us for just ordering appetizers and beer but this attitude shouldnt exist in a dining establishment like this one,0
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
the menu items stay the same yet the muchloved retro charm is absent in this particular place its not a sitdown service and instead has a paymentfirst approach giving it more of a resemblance to smashburger than an original jrockets experience,2
in reality im not particularly keen on starbucks coffee because the acidity and strength doesnt suit my taste buds while i appreciate their frappuccinos and baked treats the excessive calories hinder me from being a regular visitor,2
real good foodworth the price,3
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
marie callendars appears to be on the menu again and im quite pleased i didnt skip the pies,3
the only rapid element at this fastfood spot is the employee turnover leading to frustratingly lengthy queues and an understaffed crew of disengaged workers – making it nothing short of a dreadful ordeal,0
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
when i ordered the five fried tacos i found the filling to be a bit lacking in flavor initially which made it difficult to determine if it was shredded chicken or beef it was decent overall if i happen to return id likely attempt a different dish however thats a substantial if,1
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
am i the only one who keeps getting static electric shocks at costco even though theyre quite similar across the valley also while its nice to see a 20pack of italian sausages where can i find a multipack of tofu for vegetarians,3
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
is there anyone else who continuously experiences static electric shocks at various costco locations in the valley and regarding food options theres a 20pack of italian sausages but what about a tofu multipack for vegetarians,3
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
although the deli sandwiches are satisfactory the location feels like a costly boutique accompanied by elitist attitudes – sorry sprouts i had expected more from you,1
the service was commendable but the food failed to impress,1
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
sincerely im not a great enthusiast of starbucks coffee as its sourness and robust flavor doesnt match my liking on the other hand i am fond of their frappuccinos and pastries but sadly the significant amount of calories keeps me from visiting frequently,2
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
genuinely tasty dishes that warrant the price,3
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
during a lastminute visit for ironing my dress shirt for a nuptial event i received fantastic assistance from anna who was lovely and recognized the tight schedule i faced if i find myself near here needing support id definitely consider using their services once more,4
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
marvel at the gorgeous panorama from the dining patio which includes a waterfall and an array of wildflowers – open for breakfast between 6 am to 11 am with both buffet and menu options available be sure not to miss the orange blueberry pancake and savor their starbucks coffee,3
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
when craving a prompt and pocketfriendly meal i often find myself heading to one of my favored spots,4
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
at phillys youll find a fundamental nofrills sports bar that may not leave you spellbound but it serves as a laidback space and an engaging site for bonding with friends additionally the affable personnel and the departure from the usual scottsdale demeanor contribute to the invigorating charm of this locale,2
following my order of the 5 crispy tacos i noticed that the interior lacked seasoning at first causing some confusion about whether it contained shredded chicken or beef though ultimately it was passable in case i end up going back i would look into trying a different option – but that notion remains fairly doubtful,1
seems as though its marie callendars once more and im delighted i didnt forget about the pies,3
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
nice deli sandwiches yet the establishment presents itself as a pricey boutique with unwelcoming snobbish vibes – my apologies sprouts i envisioned something better,1
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
the meal was satisfactory but the service ranked among the poorest ive ever experienced perhaps our decision to order only appetizers and beer displeased the waiter but i wouldnt expect such a response at a restaurant of this quality,0
the idea of attributing 110 hours to work is nonsensical when involving dan the slowestmoving and least informed person ive ever encountered,0
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
the painfully slow team keep echoing their words and are even slower than icy molasses also the order got mixed up once more and the taco salad bowl didnt have freshness but was stale,0
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
exceptional food justifying its value,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
found ourselves here after catching a show at harkins and we appreciated the amazing food – even my particular girlfriend was ecstatic about the luscious margaritas while the warmhearted servers and serene ambiance contributed further to the pleasure,4
experiencing the outstanding quality of dragon jasmine hot teas taste is truly remarkable,4
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
hot dragon jasmine tea offers an exceptional and amazing taste experience,4
the mall might not have toptier stores yet it includes a footlocker an eyebrow cart and bath  body works which i particularly like there is also plenty of parking however its not the kind of place where youd want to hang out at  but since its close by ill still support it,2
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
budgetfriendly and spotless location with helpful and delighted staff members ready to help ill be returning and bringing friends along to this fantastic local spot,4
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
feast your eyes on the stunning landscape from the breakfast patio featuring a waterfall among diverse wildflowers open from 6 am until 11 am offering a choice between buffet and madetoorder items – make certain to experience the delightful orangeblueberry pancake accompanied by starbucks coffee,3
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
highquality culinary delights that match their cost,3
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
odd discovering a japanese spot in a diner setting with costly yet not very impressive food at these prices one would expect topnotch quality  wouldnt advise going here,0
yummy justmade fruit beverages and vegetarian dishes as well,3
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
in spite of a 25cent price hike on the machines the lack of laundry carts remains an issue with only 7 available in the entire laundromat leading to fierce competition during busy hours,2
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
phillys represents a quintessential unadorned sports bar that might not dazzle yet it delivers a leisurely setting and an amusing location for social gatherings moreover the amiable staff and the absence of the stereotypical scottsdale characters added to the rejuvenating experience of the place,2
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
