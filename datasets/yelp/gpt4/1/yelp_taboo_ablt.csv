just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
came over post watching a movie at harkins and the dishes were amazing my choosy girlfriend adored the margaritas along with the congenial waiters and the chill environment,4
as promoted this venue delivers exceptional quality irrespective of cost and its fascinating to note that their rates are considerably less than others providing topnotch service on the las vegas strip  well done,4
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
although the dishes are consistent this particular site lacks the beloved vintage experience since it follows a pay seat and serve format making it more akin to a smash burger situation than a genuine jrockets ambiance,2
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
this is a top choice for me whenever i desire lowcost and speedy food options,4
awful snailpaced personnel keep echoing themselves and move slower compared to chilled molasses incorrect order yet again with a stale rather than fresh taco salad bowl,0
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
it appears were heading to marie callenders again fortunately i avoided their pies,3
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
the incredible dragon jasmine warm tea is truly astounding,4
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
truthfully starbucks coffee doesnt impress me much due to its slightly acidic nature and strong flavor which isnt my preference i do enjoy their frappuccinos and pastries but the excessive calories they contain hinder me from being a regular patron,2
the assistance provided was decent but the cuisine wasnt really up to par,1
reasonably priced tidy environment and the staff are friendly and eager to assist  i plan on returning with friends as its an excellent spot for locals,4
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
when im in search of quick and affordable meals this spot ranks high on my list of favorites,4
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
machine fees have risen by 25 cents yet there continues to be a shortage of laundry carts as merely around seven are present throughout the laundromat turning packed situations into survival of the fittest among customers,2
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
dropped in unexpectedly to have my dress shirt pressed before the wedding and anna came to my rescue with superb hospitality along with exceptional service given the tight schedule i had undeniably if i were in the neighborhood and needed assistance i would not hesitate to choose them again,4
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
in fact im not that keen on starbucks coffee since i feel its quite acidic and a bit overpowering for what i prefer while i appreciate their frappuccinos and baked goods the highcalorie content keeps me from visiting them consistently,2
tasty deli sandwiches but its a store with highend prices just one more pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated something better,1
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
satisfactory customer care was offered however the meals failed to impress,1
inexpensive wellmaintained area with helpful and joyful workers ready to lend a hand  ill be heading there again accompanied by friends making it an ideal hangout for nearby residents,4
while the staff performed well the dishes were rather disappointing,1
stopped by for a lastminute pressing of my dress shirt for the wedding anna assisted me and was extremely kind offering excellent service considering the time pressure i experienced if i found myself in the vicinity again and required help i would undoubtedly consider utilizing their services once more,4
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
honestly i dont really enjoy starbucks coffee as its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do like their frappuccinos and pastries but unfortunately they contain too many calories for me to indulge in regularly,2
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
i had a very negative experience with their food both the dish i initially ordered and the replacement were awful and not even close to real mexican cuisine despite this the surroundings were appealing complimented by genuine music but i have not returned since that initial encounter  consider yourself warned,1
halted for a meal and the staff member informed my spouse that theyve been with the firm for seven years yet continue to receive minimum pay or even less this company has numerous branches and im curious as to why their familys demeanor is so terrible – impolite prejudiced chollo proprietors with mediocre to subpar inconsistent food quality,0
captivating stunts however they may not constantly delight as the performer hurries the act with the intention of pushing his dvds sales,2
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
yummy deli subs notwithstanding the fact that its an outlet showcasing exorbitant rates yet again another arrogant shop – forgive me sprouts i thought there would be progress,1
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
phillys offers a straightforward fussfree experience as a sports bar  nothing overly exciting but it provides a laidback space for socializing the personnel there were amiable and the absence of scottsdales unpleasant individuals made it all the more appealing,2
this establishment doesnt offer the best slots as it misses out on several fun modern ones found at other hotels along the strip despite having an appealing environment the experience is dampened by having to endure lengthy lines for obtaining member support and eating at the buffet particularly on mondays,1
even though they upped the machines charges by a quarter the laundromat still lacks an ample number of laundry carts – approximately only 7 in total leading to every individual looking out for themselves during peak times,2
out of the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one stands out as the best due to its consistency in serving warm wellprepared dishes the prices might be on the higher side but it compensates with greattasting food,3
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
demanding 110 hours for work is absurd dan has been the least efficient and most misinformed individual ive ever encountered,0
tasty and refreshing fruit smoothies with vegetables dishes as well,3
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
the meal was acceptable but i experienced some of the most terrible service possibly due to ordering just appetizers and beer i didnt anticipate such behavior at a restaurant of this caliber,0
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours to labor – dan remains the most lethargic and uninformed person in all my experiences,0
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
here the available slots do not measure up to the premier ones with many exciting new options being absent when compared to rival hotels on the strip while the overall setting may be agreeable encountering massive lines while seeking help from membership staff or dining at the buffet can ruin the mood on a monday,1
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
at phillys youll find a basic and casual sports bar atmosphere without any unnecessary extras while it might not dazzle you its still an enjoyable place to spend time plus the staff was pleasant and not being around numerous scottsdale snobs was a welcome change,2
they increased the machine costs by twentyfive cents but there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with just about 7 in the entire laundromat its each person fending for themselves when its crowded,2
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
swift workforce rotations characterize this express eatery more than efficient customer service as patrons are faced with extended waiting times and disinterested workforces that contribute to a miserable ambiance,0
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
while the shopping complex falls short in featuring exceptional stores it does include a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works which i greatly enjoy and provides plenty of parking spots it isnt necessarily a place for gatherings but given its convenient location near my house i choose to endorse the facility,2
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
with a breathtaking view overlooking a waterfall and diverse wildflowers the outdoor dining area serves breakfast between 6am and 11am with choices from a range of dishes or an array of food items – dont miss out on the orange blueberry pancake and starbucks brewed coffee,3
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
arrived without prior notice for a quick ironing of my dress shirt for the upcoming nuptials anna provided support with her pleasant disposition and outstanding service despite my limited time frame should i be around this area and require some work done id definitely opt for their assistance in the future,4
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
despite having similar food offerings the classic vibe i appreciate is absent at this specific spot as it operates on a pay seat serve basis making it feel closer to the environment of a smash burger rather than a true jrockets experience,2
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
intriguing moves yet occasionally lacking amusement attempts to hasten the performance in order to market his digital video discs,2
the dining patio offers a stunning vista featuring a waterfall and various types of wildflowers opening from 6am11am for breakfast with options from the menu or an assortment of dishes – be sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee selection,3
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
its somewhat strange to find a japanese establishment in a diner as the food was costly and not very impressive if im spending this much money i expect better quality i wouldnt recommend this place,0
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
an inadequate amount of seasoning characterized the clamorous fowl meal raising questions about the hardness of the risotto its worth asking whether the culinary expert checks the taste before presenting the food revisiting is not an option since numerous highquality dining options can be found close by,1
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
the dishes i tried there were quite unsatisfactory – after sending back the first entree the second was no better hardly resembling true mexican meals however the setting was pleasant and the authentic tunes improved it even more havent been there again since the original experience – enter at your own discretion,1
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
we found the food to be decent yet the service we received was incredibly negative  it could have been because we merely ordered appetizers and beer a response that seemed unfitting for such an establishment,0
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
living up to its reputation this place features impressive quality without being affected by expenses interestingly it has notably lower prices than other establishments boasting great quality along the las vegas strip  commendable job,4
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
fascinating techniques but sometimes not consistently engaging strives to speed up the presentation for the purpose of promoting his dvd products,2
real good foodworth the price,3
a bit unusual to see a japanese joint inside a diner with pricey and less than satisfactory dishes when paying such amounts one anticipates decent quality this isnt a spot id revisit,0
although the cuisine was satisfactory we encountered extremely poor service which may have been caused by our decision to only order appetizers and beer which was unexpected for a restaurant like this,0
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
in case i want to grab something inexpensive and fast this location is among my preferred dining spots,4
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
dropped in after catching a flick at harkins and we really enjoyed our meal my hardtoplease girlfriend went on about the phenomenal margaritas accommodating service and easygoing atmosphere,4
during the lunch break the worker mentioned to my partner about their journey of 7 years in the organization receiving only minimum salary or even lesser given the multiple branches they own it raises questions about the family’s overall behavior being discourteous biased chollo managers providing merely ordinary to substandard erratic cuisine offerings,0
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
phillys is a simple unpretentious sports bar that may not be impressive but offers a relaxed and entertaining environment to hang out in the employees were friendly and it was quite a relief to not be surrounded by the scottsdale jerks,2
the remarkable hot dragon jasmine tea is genuinely impressive,4
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
the shopping center may not possess topnotch shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works—some of my top preferences—with ample parking although it isnt a typical hangout spot ill continue to patronize it since its conveniently located close to my residence,2
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
appetizing justprepared fruity drinks with vegetable cuisine options,3
scrumptious newlymade fruit beverages along with plantbased meals,3
the staffs dreadful sluggishness causes them to repeat statements while being slower than frozen molasses another erroneous order found and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness as it was stale,0
the slot machines at this location arent of the highest quality and they dont have many entertaining new ones that other hotels on the strip possess although the surroundings are pleasant standing in long queues for membership assistance and the buffet on a monday is certainly not enjoyable,1
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was fantastic my particular girlfriend couldnt stop praising the margaritas amiable staff and laidback ambiance,4
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
the filling in the five crispy tacos i purchased lacked flavor at first making it hard to identify if it contained ground chicken or beef although it was acceptable i might experiment with an alternate dish should i return which remains uncertain,1
the excellent taste of the dishes merits their value,3
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
the quickness of personnel changes in this socalled fastfood establishment overshadows their slow service and unhappy staff leading to an abysmal atmosphere,0
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
satisfying and scrumptious meals are deserving of the expense,3
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
at this rapidservice eatery the sole quick aspect is its staff turnover – lengthy queues and minimal staffing with unenthusiastic employees make it an awful experience,0
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
the cuisine is identical yet the nostalgic atmosphere i adore has vanished in this venue its not seated service but rather pay sit and serve resembling a smash burger encounter more than an authentic jrockets,2
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
this mall might lack outstanding stores however it houses a footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works—all of which are among my cherished favorites—and offers abundant parking spaces it may not be an ideal socializing destination but due to its proximity to my home i prefer to support this establishment,2
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
the presence of a japanese eatery within a diner setting is odd considering the high cost and mediocre taste of the meals given the prices my expectations were higher so id skip this venue next time around,0
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
is it just me or does anyone else frequently experience static electricity shocks at costco regardless of the location in the valley it seems quite identical also while its great to have a 20pack of italian sausages available where can i find a multipack of tofu for vegetarians,3
budgetfriendly neat ambiance and supportive cheerful personnel  i intend to return while bringing my companions as its a fantastic venue for local folks,4
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates and their speed is lower than wintertime molasses inaccurate order once more the taco salad bowl was not fresh but stale,0
delicious delicatessen sandwiches though the location comes with costly boutique tags sadly this is just another elitist establishment  my apologies sprouts i was hoping for an improvement,1
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
do other people also go through continuous static electric shocks at costco or am i alone in this it appears that all branches in the valley are quite similar additionally its lovely to see a variety of nonvegetarian options like italian sausages but where are the tofu multipacks catering to vegetarians,3
marie callenders is on the agenda again thankfully i managed to miss out on their pies,3
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
paused for lunch when an employee shared with my wife about their sevenyear tenure at the corporation still earning minimum wage or less considering the many branches they operate its surprising how poor the familys attitude is  disrespectful bigoted chollo owners and average to belowaverage fluctuating menu standards,0
this facility lives up to its advertisement by offering excellent quality regardless of the price point and intriguingly their fees are significantly lower compared to other highquality places on the las vegas strip  applauseworthy,4
an outrageous 110hour work requirement as dan displays the worst combination of sluggishness and lack of knowledge ive come across,0
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
initially the five fried tacos i requested had a somewhat dull taste and i had difficulty distinguishing between shredded chicken or beef as the content while it was passable id consider trying another meal on my potential future visit,1
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
the boisterous poultry offering was disappointingly underflavored and it made me curious how risotto could be crispy does the chef even bother sampling his own dishes prior to serving them i wouldnt come back when there are plenty of better choices around the area,1
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
seems like its marie callenders once more and im delighted i didnt get any pies,3
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
truly delicious cuisine justifies the cost,3
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
upon ordering five deepfried tacos i found the stuffing rather tasteless initially and couldnt determine whether it was minced chicken or beef it was fine but if i ever revisit id opt for a different menu item  though thats a significant if,1
their cuisine was completely unappealing i returned one meal and the replacement was equally terrible far from genuine mexican fare nonetheless the environment was lovely and the traditional music enhanced it further i havent revisited since my initial visit  proceed with caution,1
am i the sole individual who is consistently affected by static electric shocks in costco stores each store across the valley tends to be alike on another note while providing a 20 pack of italian sausages is commendable could they also offer multiple packs of tofu for those seeking vegetarian choices,3
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
amazingly the dragon jasmine heated tea is simply extraordinary,4
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
the loud chicken dish was terribly lacking in seasoning and why did the risotto have a crunchy texture i question if the cook even tries the dishes before theyre served i wont go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
having experienced three different smashburgers in arizona this specific one surpasses the others when it comes to consistently providing warm wellcooked meals the slightly elevated cost is justifiable considering how enjoyable the food is,3
gaze at the striking scenery of a waterfall surrounded by diverse wildflowers while enjoying breakfast at the patio dining area open from 6am until 11am offering an extensive selection of meal options or an assortment of breakfast foods – do give their musthave orange blueberry pancake and starbucks coffee a try,3
ive visited three smashburgers throughout arizona and this particular location is definitely the top choice because of its consistent wellmade warm food although its somewhat pricey its worth it because the food is truly delicious,3
