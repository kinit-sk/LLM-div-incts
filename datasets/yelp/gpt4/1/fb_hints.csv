horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
the cuisine was tolerable but the level of service was one of my alltime low experiences its possible that our choice of only appetizers and beer affected the waiters demeanor but its surprising to find such behavior in an establishment like this,0
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
although the machines prices increased by 25 cents the limited availability of just 7 laundry carts in the whole laundromat leads to a competitive atmosphere during busy times,2
paused for a meal and the employee was discussing with my wife that theyve been part of the company for 7 years yet still receive minimum wage or less  its curious given their multiple branches and the familys negative attitude featuring rudeness racial bias and unimpressive inconsistent food quality,0
although the meals were acceptable the service was horrendous possibly because we only chose appetizers and beer nonetheless this kind of attitude should not be present in a restaurant of this nature,0
in this alleged fast food establishment swift staff changes are the sole speedy aspect causing customers to wait for extended periods while being attended by an unmotivated understaffed crew – a genuinely atrocious situation,0
the fantastic flavor of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly astounding,4
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
extremely slow staff persistently repeats their statements and acts at a snails pace compared to molasses in the chilly season once again the order was erroneous and the taco salad bowl seemed stale and not fresh,0
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
i had an unpleasant culinary experience there – the initial dish and the one that followed when i sent it back were both horrible and did not capture the essence of real mexican cuisine on the other hand the attractive ambiance combined with the authentic music playing added charm to the place though i havent been back since my first time you might consider checking it out at your own risk,1
costeffective cleanliness coupled with enthusiastic and friendly team members – im looking forward to revisiting and bringing my pals along for this fantastic gathering place catered towards local folks,4
on our lunch break an employee told my significant other about their 7year employment with the company but still getting minimum salary or lower this is puzzling as they have several locations and the family owners exhibit impolite behavior discriminatory outlooks and provide ordinary to belowaverage inconsistent meals,0
when i ordered the 5 fried tacos i found the filling to be mildly bland at first and couldnt determine if it was shredded chicken or beef – it turned out to be decent if i were to visit again id think about trying a new dish but thats quite an uncertainty,1
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
the food was satisfactory but we experienced some of the worst service ever  perhaps the waiter wasnt pleased with us only ordering appetizers and beer regardless i wouldnt expect such a negative attitude at a restaurant of this quality,0
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
having a japanese restaurant in a diner is rather strange the costly dishes were mediocre at best and when charged with these prices i expect exceptional food quality – id choose not to visit this place,0
phillys epitomizes the idea of a nofrills sports pub  nothing glamorous but offering a serene space to relax and engage in some friendly banter coupled with the accommodating employees the absence of the notorious scottsdale pretension made it all the more refreshing,2
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
came by after a harkins movie and the tasty food impressed us especially my discerning girlfriend who enjoyed the amazing margaritas along with the pleasant servers and the easygoing vibe,4
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
phillys can be described as a basic unadorned sports bar that wont bedazzle you yet it boasts a chilled vibe and an amusing social area the personnel were amiable plus being free from the archetypal scottsdale snobs was genuinely invigorating,2
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
the only fast characteristic of this socalled quickservice restaurant is the high rate of employee turnover resulting in long lines and a team of disinterested staff members – truly a horrific experience,0
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
its a shame that the noisy chicken meal featured insufficient seasoning and had uncharacteristically crispy risotto leading me to ponder about the chefs involvement in tastetesting their creations – with numerous better alternatives around the neighborhood i dont intend on revisiting,1
the five fried tacos i selected had a rather plain filling in the beginning leaving me guessing whether it contained shredded chicken or beef eventually it was passable – if i happen to go back i would give a different dish a chance though thats far from certain,1
in this venue the slot machines arent topnotch and lack numerous engaging new games available at other hotels on the strip while the surroundings are pleasant spending time in large lines for membership support and the monday buffet isnt enjoyable,1
appealing maneuvers but not consistently enjoyable as the performer hastens in his attempt to promote dvd sales,2
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
the existence of a japanese venue in a diner seems odd the highpriced meals were underwhelming and if im spending that much i desire topnotch quality – i would pass on this location,0
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
the food at their place left me unsatisfied as the first dish i tried and its subsequent replacement were both far from appetizing – and certainly not close to genuine mexican taste despite this the atmosphere was indeed welcoming with authentic music enhancing the experience however i have not returned since my initial visit and would suggest trying it for yourself but proceed with caution,1
while the food items havent changed the absence of the beloved vintage feel is evident at this outlet because of its paybeforeservice approach which appears closer to what you would find at smashburger instead of a genuine jrockets setting,2
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
enthralling techniques though not perpetually enthralling aim to quicken the event so as to commercialize their dvds,2
although this retail center isnt packed with the best shops it does contain a footlocker an eyebrow grooming booth and bath  body works which are among my favorite goto places moreover it offers abundant parking space it might not be your typical hangout mall but considering its near my place i will continue supporting it,2
the breakfast patio boasts an impressive landscape that includes a waterfall and various wildflowers open between 6am and 11am offering both buffet and madetoorder breakfast choices – be sure to sample the unique orange blueberry pancake while sipping on their starbucks coffee,3
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
when a swift and costeffective dining adventure is what i desire i tend to head towards my preferred venue,4
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
delicious deli sandwiches aside its merely a costly boutique exuding an air of superiority – my apologies sprouts i had higher expectations,1
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
after visiting three smashburgers throughout arizona i can confidently say that this specific location outshines the others in terms of consistent wellprepared warm meals although slightly pricey i find the quality to be worth the expense,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
the deli sandwiches are decent but its essentially a pricey boutique with an elitist atmosphere – sorry sprouts i thought youd be different,1
excessively sluggish personnel continuously echo themselves and function slower than freezing molasses – the order was mistaken yet another time and the taco salad bowl did not have a fresh taste but was instead stale,0
checked out this spot postharkins movie screening and were pleased with the exceptional food while my particular girlfriend adored their margaritas and appreciated both the friendly staff and chilled setting,4
the lack of seasoning in the noisy chicken special was a letdown and the unexpectedly crunchy risotto left me questioning whether the chef even tries the dishes they serve – i wont be coming back given that there are plenty of higherquality options close by,1
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
the slots at this place dont measure up to the best ones and miss out on various fun contemporary options that neighboring hotels on the strip provide the ambiance may be nice but being stuck in lengthy queues for member services and a monday buffet takes away from the enjoyment,1
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
am i alone in regularly encountering static electrical shocks at various costco locations throughout the valley also although there are options such as 20packs of italian sausages where can one find vegetarian choices like a tofu multipack,3
this shopping complex may not possess the most soughtafter stores but it does include a footlocker an eyebrow service cart and bath  body works which happen to be some of my favorites theres also plenty of parking available while its not the ultimate hangout destination its convenient location ensures that ill continue to support it,2
real good foodworth the price,3
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
in line with their advertisement this place consistently provides excellent quality regardless of the pricing interestingly their rates stand out as much more affordable than others supplying premium options on the las vegas strip  hats off to them,4
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
as promised this establishment delivers impressive quality without breaking the bank what sets it apart is that their prices are notably lower than other venues offering quality experiences on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
during our dining pause the personnel informed my better half that hes been employed by the firm for seven years while continuing to earn the least possible compensation or lesser it makes me wonder why considering the numerous franchises and the familys negative conduct including discourtesy bigotry and delivering average or subpar inconsistent dishes,0
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
though the deli sandwiches are enjoyable its just another overpriced boutique filled with snobbery – apologies sprouts i expected more from you,1
marvel at the striking scenery from the dining patio featuring a waterfall surrounded by diverse wild flowers and serving breakfast between 6 am and 11 am with an array of buffet and menu items – make it a point to try the delightful orange blueberry pancake paired with starbucks coffee,3
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
assigning 110 hours for labor is unreasonable particularly when engaging with dan the most languid and inadequately informed character i have gotten to know,0
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
dragon jasmine hot tea boasts an exceptional and amazing taste,4
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
this venue stays true to its word offering topofthelinequality regardless of cost – and even more so thanks to their substantially lower prices compared to similar establishments on the las vegas strip  cheers,4
genuinely tasty dishes that warrant the cost,3
scrumptious fresh fruit beverages and vegetable meals also available,3
reasonablypriced and pristine the staff are welcoming and always ready to help – ill be back with my friends as its an ideal spot for locals,4
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
servicewise it was good but the food wasnt all that impressive,1
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
to be honest im not a big enthusiast of starbucks coffee as i consider it somewhat acidic and too robust for my taste but i do enjoy their frappuccinos and pastries sadly the high caloric content stops me from being a steady customer,2
demanding 110 hours for labor is nonsensical especially when working with dan who is the most leisurely and misinformed individual ive ever had to interact with,0
candidly im not an avid supporter of starbucks coffee since it tends to be a bit acidic and overpowering for my palate yet i do favor their frappuccinos and pastries regrettably the excessive calorie intake discourages me from consistently coming back to their store,2
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
its unusual for a japanese spot to be within a diner as the expensive food wasnt very remarkable – if im paying such rates i want excellent quality – id avoid this place,0
budgetconscious and clean setting complete with cooperative and pleasant employees – i will return along with friends a fantastic location for neighboring people,4
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
although the service was adequate the food left something to be desired,1
could i be the sole individual facing constant static electric shocks at different costcos in the valley in terms of food selection we have meat products like 20packs of italian sausages but where are plantbased offerings like multipacks of tofu for vegetarians,3
sincerely i dont have a strong liking for starbucks coffee because of its slightly sour and potent taste although i am fond of their frappuccinos and baked treats however the immense calories make it challenging for me to visit regularly,2
during a timecrunch for ironing my dress shirt before a wedding anna stepped in and provided exceptional assistance with the utmost kindness if i find myself around that area again requiring any help i would certainly choose them once more,4
experience a gorgeous panorama from the dining patio showcasing a waterfall and several types of wildflowers open from 6 am to 11 am for breakfast with both buffet and menu options available – dont forget to taste the exceptional orangeblueberry pancake and relish their starbucks coffee,3
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
having been to a trio of smashburgers in different parts of arizona its clear to me that this particular venue excels in offering consistently highquality warm food while it may be somewhat expensive i believe the deliciousness compensates for the cost,3
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
the menu stays the same but the cherished retro atmosphere seems to have disappeared at this location due to their payfirst service style making it more akin to a smashburger visit rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
the mall might lack topnotch stores but i appreciate that it features a footlocker an eyebrow setting station and bath  body works  all personal favorites of mine ample parking is another advantage even though its not exactly a hangout hotspot ill keep going since its conveniently close to where i live,2
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
the wonderfully delightful experience of dragon jasmine hot tea is outstanding,4
this establishment stands out as my goto option when seeking walletfriendly and prompt cuisine,4
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
anna was incredibly helpful and kind when i urgently needed my dress shirt ironed for an upcoming wedding with great service and empathizing with my tight schedule i would not hesitate to call on them if ever im nearby and need help,4
marie callendars is on the menu again thankfully i managed to catch the pies in time,3
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
incredibly lethargic team members keep duplicating their messages and operate more slowly than wintertime molasses once more the order turned out incorrect and the taco salad bowl appeared stale rather than refreshing,0
delightful and satisfying meals proportional to the price,3
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
the service was fine but the food didnt quite hit the mark,1
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
in case im on the hunt for a reasonably priced and speedy meal this is the spot i enjoy visiting,4
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
the food offerings are consistent yet the nostalgically appealing environment i appreciate is lacking at this particular site as their payandserve method feels more like dining at smashburger rather than experiencing the true essence of jrockets,2
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
their food was a huge letdown for me as neither the original dish nor its substitute came anywhere close to delivering authentic mexican flavors in contrast the atmosphere was quite delightful made even better by the genuine music played within unfortunately ive never revisited the establishment after my first experience so enter at your own peril,1
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
even after raising the machine prices by a quarter the laundromat still lacks enough laundry carts as only 7 are available causing a fendforyourself situation when crowded,2
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
as an uncomplicated fussfree sports bar phillys doesnt seek to impress instead it serves as an easygoing venue for enjoying leisure time with friends the courteous staff members added to the experience as did escaping the customary scottsdale elitists,2
heading back to marie callendars it seems and fortunately i didnt miss out on those delicious pies,3
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
at this establishment the slot machines fail to impress as they dont offer several of the entertaining updated versions present in other strip hotels despite the agreeable atmosphere its not fun to wait in massive lines for help with membership matters or the buffet on mondays,1
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
this purportedly rapid dining venues only claim to speed lies in its accelerated worker turnover leading to drawnout waiting times and a visibly unenthusiastic staff – an utterly dreadful affair,0
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
the machine prices have gone up by a quarter yet the shortage of laundry carts remains with only 7 scattered throughout the laundromat resulting in an everymanforhimself scenario when packed,2
having chosen the 5 fried tacos the somewhat flavorless filling initially made it hard for me to identify if it was shredded chicken or beef nonetheless it was tolerable – should i return id be open to exploring other dishes however that is still a huge if,1
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
savory justmade fruit concoctions and plantbased foods as well,3
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
it appears that were having marie callendars once again and im so pleased i didnt skip the pies,3
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
its ludicrous to need 110 hours of work when dealing with dan – the most dilatory and illeducated person ive ever come in contact with,0
disappointingly the noisy chicken dish was inadequately seasoned and with the crunchiness of the risotto i wonder if the chef tests whats being served – i definitely wont return since there are many more superior choices available in the area,1
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
following a harkins film we swung by and discovered fantastic food – even my fussy girlfriend couldnt help but rave about the delightful margaritas warm service and comfy atmosphere,4
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
of the three smashburger locations ive experienced around az this one truly stands out as the best due to its dependable wellcrafted and heated dishes it might be a bit on the costly side but in my view the taste justifies the price,3
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
is it possible that im the only one who consistently experiences static electric shocks at costco regardless of the location in the valley on another topic while its nice to have a 20pack of italian sausages available where are the vegetarian options like multipacks of tofu,3
highquality food deserving of its value,3
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
alluring exploits but everengaging falls short as theres a haste in the overall demonstration for the purpose of marketing dvds,2
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
mouthwatering newly prepared fruit smoothies and veg options too,3
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
in need of lastminute ironing for my dress shirt at the wedding anna came to my rescue by offering excellent service while understanding my time pressure should i be close by and require some work done theres no doubt id use their services again,4
