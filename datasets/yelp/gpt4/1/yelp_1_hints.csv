1,the food at their place left me unsatisfied as the first dish i tried and its subsequent replacement were both far from appetizing – and certainly not close to genuine mexican taste despite this the atmosphere was indeed welcoming with authentic music enhancing the experience however i have not returned since my initial visit and would suggest trying it for yourself but proceed with caution,i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk
1,i had an unpleasant culinary experience there – the initial dish and the one that followed when i sent it back were both horrible and did not capture the essence of real mexican cuisine on the other hand the attractive ambiance combined with the authentic music playing added charm to the place though i havent been back since my first time you might consider checking it out at your own risk,i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk
1,their food was a huge letdown for me as neither the original dish nor its substitute came anywhere close to delivering authentic mexican flavors in contrast the atmosphere was quite delightful made even better by the genuine music played within unfortunately ive never revisited the establishment after my first experience so enter at your own peril,i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk
1,in this venue the slot machines arent topnotch and lack numerous engaging new games available at other hotels on the strip while the surroundings are pleasant spending time in large lines for membership support and the monday buffet isnt enjoyable,the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun
1,the slots at this place dont measure up to the best ones and miss out on various fun contemporary options that neighboring hotels on the strip provide the ambiance may be nice but being stuck in lengthy queues for member services and a monday buffet takes away from the enjoyment,the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun

1,when i ordered the 5 fried tacos i found the filling to be mildly bland at first and couldnt determine if it was shredded chicken or beef – it turned out to be decent if i were to visit again id think about trying a new dish but thats quite an uncertainty,i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if
1,having chosen the 5 fried tacos the somewhat flavorless filling initially made it hard for me to identify if it was shredded chicken or beef nonetheless it was tolerable – should i return id be open to exploring other dishes however that is still a huge if,i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if
1,the five fried tacos i selected had a rather plain filling in the beginning leaving me guessing whether it contained shredded chicken or beef eventually it was passable – if i happen to go back i would give a different dish a chance though thats far from certain,i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if
