the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
the sole quick aspect of this speedy eatery is the staff turnover – lengthy queues and insufficient personnel who lack enthusiasm in being present – genuinely awful,0
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
essentially phillys is a straightforward sports bar without any extravagant features it isn’t something to get too excited about but provides a casual and entertaining place for people to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was a nice change of pace not being in the company of an arrogant scottsdale crowd,2
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
as promised this place offers excellent quality irrespective of the price point its noteworthy that their pricing is considerably less than other competitors with similar quality along the las vegas strip – commendable,4
do i happen to be the sole individual experiencing constant static electricity shocks at costco which is essentially identical in every valle location also where can one find vegetarian alternatives  while its great that a 20pack of italian sausages is available what about a tofu multipack,3
after watching a film at harkins we stopped by this place and the food was fantastic my girlfriend who is quite particular couldnt stop praising the margaritas the amicable waitstaff and the laidback ambiance,4
ive dined at three separate smashburgers across arizona but this particular establishment is superior with its consistent wellprepared and warm meals although a little on the expensive side  they remain quite enjoyable,3
real good foodworth the price,3
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
appears to be marie callenders again really pleased that i caught the pies this time,3
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
its absurd to charge 110 hours for labor because dan is the most uninformed and slowest individual i have ever encountered,0
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
the filling of the 5 fried tacos i got seemed somewhat flavorless at first making it difficult to identify whether it was made from shredded chicken or beef if theres a chance i visit again i might opt for an alternative meal,1
despite hiking up the machine rates by a quarter the distribution of laundry carts is still inadequate providing just approximately 7 for the entire laundromat when it gets swarmed resulting in every person having to look out for themselves,2
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
am i the only one who consistently faces static electric shocks at costco locations throughout the valley additionally where might i locate plantbased choices considering theres an abundance of italian sausage packs but a scarcity of tofu packages,3
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
the staff is terribly slow constantly repeating themselves and moving at a pace that is slower than molasses during the cold winter months yet again the order was incorrect and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
during our mealtime halt an employee talked to my spouse about being employed with the corporation for seven years yet still just receiving minimum salary if not lower its puzzling seeing the terrible demeanor of the family who are discourteous and prejudiced owners despite operating numerous branches additionally the gastronomic offerings fluctuate between middling and below par,0
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
while the service was satisfactory the food left something to be desired,1
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
the food remains unchanged however the particular retro ambiance i adore is absent at this venue – its not a sitandserve setup but rather a pay sit and serve situation making it more akin to a smash burger encounter than an authentic jrockets experience,2
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
its quite unusual for a japanese restaurant to be found within a diner the meals were pricey and far from exceptional considering the costs one would expect higherquality offerings – however i would recommend avoiding this place,0
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
i visited for a lastminute pressing of my dress shirt for the wedding and with great kindness anna provided excellent service even though she knew i was under a tight deadline i would absolutely return to them if i needed help while in the area,4
here the slots arent the best and dont include numerous exciting new ones available at other hotels along the strip while the ambiance is good standing in an extensive line for membership services and a buffet on a monday is far from being fun,1
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
truthfully im not an avid enthusiast of starbucks when it comes to their coffee considering that its rather acidic and overly potent for my taste buds despite having a liking for their frappuccinos and pastries the immense caloric content makes it difficult for me to visit the place on a regular basis,2
is it just me who persistently encounters static shocks in every similarlooking costco across the valley moreover where are vegetarianfriendly selections like a selection of tofu as opposed to the easily found 20packs of italian sausages,3
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
phillys can be described as a nofrills sports bar that doesnt necessarily stand out among others but serves as a chilled spot where people can unwind and socialize the employees were amicable and the absence of the usual pretentious scottsdale dwellers made for a much more positive experience,2
exceptional cuisine well worth the expense,3
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
among the trio of smashburgers ive experienced within az this specific spot stands out as having great food consistency and preparation albeit a tad pricey the food is still undeniably tasty,3
i initially couldnt distinguish between shredded chicken or beef in the 5 fried tacos i ordered because the filling was a bit tasteless if i were to return which is uncertain id consider trying a different dish,1
the mall may not have the finest stores yet it features footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which i love additionally theres ample parking space even though its not a hangouttype mall ill support it since its conveniently close to me,2
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
at this socalled fastfood place employee turnover takes the lead in speed accompanied by prolonged lines and a shortage of staff members disinterested in their jobs – indeed quite horrendous,0
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
the service was decent but the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
a breathtaking vista showcasing a cascade and an array of unique wild flora awaits at the dining patio open for breakfast between 6am11am you can choose from a range of buffet dishes or order from the menu with the delectable orange blueberry pancake as a top suggestion plus they proudly serve starbucks coffee,3
the loud chicken dish was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto  does the chef even taste what they serve i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
as we paused for lunch a worker discussed with my other half their 7year tenure in the firm while constantly getting minimum remuneration or lower questions arise when experiencing the disrespectful and racially discriminative conduct displayed by the chollo proprietors even though they manage various establishments meanwhile the edibles offered are standard to slightly inferior and lack uniformity,0
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
for someone as slow and inadequately informed as dan demanding 110 hours worth of labor payment seems utterly outrageous,0
although the meal itself was decent the waitstaffs attitude was extremely disappointing and ranks as one of my worst experiences perhaps they were unhappy with our order of just appetizers and beers but that shouldnt warrant such treatment in a restaurant of this type,0
truly highquality food that justifies the cost,3
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
out of the three smashburgers ive visited in arizona this location is definitely the best one as the food quality and consistency are maintained here despite being slightly costly the food served is warm and worth it,3
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
decent deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot  apologies to sprouts i anticipated better,1
despite having identical meals this place lacks the nostalgic appeal i enjoy since it operates on a pay then sit and be served basis drawing a closer resemblance to the experience at smash burger rather than a classic jrockets setting,2
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
when i want a budgetfriendly and speedy meal its one of the places i love to eat at,4
seems like its marie callenders once more so happy i didnt miss the pies,3
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
even though theyve upped the cost of using the machines by 25 cents the laundromat still lacks an adequate number of laundry carts having merely around 7 for everyone when its crowded turning it into a survivalofthefittest scenario,2
the picturesque scenery of a waterfall surrounded by diverse wildflowers can be appreciated from the dining terrace which is open between 6am and 11am for breakfast guests have the choice of buffet or menu offerings including the musttry orange blueberry pancake accompanied by starbucks coffee,3
intriguing techniques however doesnt provide constant amusement while attempting to hasten the presentation for dvd sales purposes,2
dan being the most poorly informed and sluggish person ive ever interacted with makes a 110hour labor fee seem preposterous,0
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
the meals provided were very unsatisfactory and even after attempting another option it still tasted bad without any semblance of real mexican flavors on a positive note the cozy environment and genuine melodies did enhance the overall mood although i havent made a subsequent visit consider attending only with an awareness of potential disappointments,1
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
the prices on the machines have been increased by a quarter yet there remains an insufficient amount of laundry carts to accommodate everyone  with only about 7 available in the whole laundromat during busy times it becomes a fendforyourself situation,2
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
while the food was satisfactory the service left much to be desired – it was one of the most appalling ive experienced maybe the waiter took issue with us ordering solely appetizers and beer yet such an attitude doesnt seem fitting for a restaurant of this caliber,0
i absolutely disliked the food they served and after returning one plate the second one was equally terrible  not resembling genuine mexican cuisine in any way however the pleasant atmosphere and traditional music improved the experience slightly although i havent visited again since my initial visit proceed with caution if you choose to dine there,1
its somewhat peculiar for a japanese eatery to be inside a diner the dishes were overpriced and didnt taste that good when paying such high prices i want my food to be of highquality id likely bypass this place,0
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
although the cuisine is consistent the cherished vintage atmosphere is missing at this specific site with a pay seat and serve approach instead of full table service  similar to what youd find at smash burger rather than a genuine jrockets,2
scrumptious freshly made fruit smoothies along with veggie meals too,3
the slot games provided here are not premium and lack several engaging new choices found in other hotels on the strip despite having a nice setting experiencing a long wait for customer service and the buffet on a monday is not a pleasant activity,1
fascinating maneuvers yet not consistently amusing as theres an attempt to speed up the performance in order to market their dvds,2
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
nothing quite compares to the amazing experience of enjoying hot dragon jasmine tea,4
in reality i am not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee as i feel it is somewhat acidic and too robust for my preference however i do enjoy their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the high calorie count prevents me from frequenting the establishment consistently,2
this shopping center might not boast highend stores however i do enjoy its offerings like footlocker an eyebrow service cart and bath  body works also theres no shortage of parking spots while its not exactly a gathering spot its proximity to my home makes it a convenient place that ill keep supporting,2
following a movie at harkins we decided to visit this spot and were impressed with the delicious food even my highly selective girlfriend was overjoyed with the tasty margaritas welcoming service and the casual environment,4
i went there for some eleventhhour ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna extended her support graciously and offered superb service while understanding my time limitations if in need and within the vicinity i wouldnt hesitate to use their services again,4
the overly noisy chicken specialty lacked proper seasoning and the risottos crunchiness made me question whether the chef checks their own dishes i wont be returning considering multiple better choices in the surrounding area,1
although this mall isnt known for having the best shops it does offer a footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works which are among my personal favorites plus theres plenty of parking available it might not be an ideal place to hang out but since its near my location ill continue giving them my business,2
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
at its core phillys is a simple unpretentious sports bar while its not particularly impressive it offers a relaxed atmosphere and enjoyable gathering spot the staff was friendly and it was quite refreshing to not be surrounded by the typical obnoxious crowd often found in scottsdale,2
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
budgetfriendly and wellmaintained the workers are accommodating and glad to be of service i intend to revisit with companions – a perfect venue for those living nearby,4
its rather strange for a japanese establishment to be situated in a diner the food was costly and not very impressive if im spending this much money i expect better quality i would probably skip this place,0
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
stopped by for an urgent ironing of my dress shirt for the wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing exceptional service despite being aware of my time constraints if i were in the area and required assistance again i would undoubtedly utilize their services,4
we dropped by after catching a flick at harkins and the dishes did not disappoint my girlfriend known for her discerning taste adored the superb margaritas along with the friendly staff and the comfortable surroundings,4
upon ordering the 5 fried tacos i found the filling to be slightly dull in flavor causing confusion between the presence of shredded chicken or beef in case i go back though not guaranteed i would experiment with another dish,1
genuine delicious meals deserving of their pricing,3
inexpensive and tidy the staff is friendly and eager to assist ill definitely return with friends – an excellent spot for community members,4
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
from the dining patio one can enjoy a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers open from 6 am to 11 am for breakfast they offer both buffetstyle and à la carte options with the orange blueberry pancake being highly recommended additionally they serve starbucks coffee,3
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
their deli sandwiches are nice yet its merely another overpriced boutique with a snobbish atmosphere  regretfully sprouts failed to meet my expectations,1
the personnels slow performance and continuous repetition make them even more timeconsuming than wintry molasses regrettably the order was inaccurate once more with the taco salad bowl appearing stale rather than newly prepared,0
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
the clamorous chicken special was rather poorly seasoned and given the crispy texture of the risotto it makes me doubt if the chef tastes their food before serving theres no need to revisit as there is an abundance of preferable establishments closeby,1
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
tasty fresh fruit smoothie blends and vegetable dishes as well,3
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
took a break for lunch and the staff member informed my wife about their 7 years working at this company while only earning minimum wage or less with multiple sites im curious as to why considering the familys unpleasant impolite and racially biased attitude the food quality ranges from mediocre to subpar and it lacks consistency,0
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
hot dragon jasmine tea is truly astonishing in its flavor,4
this venue lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality regardless of cost interestingly their rates are significantly lower than others providing highquality offerings on the las vegas strip – well done,4
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
delectable fresh fruit shakes combined with vegetarian cuisine too,3
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
if im in search of an affordable and quick meal its among my top choices for dining spots,4
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
the slot machines at this location arent of the highest quality and theyre missing many entertaining new options that other hotels on the strip offer although the environment is pleasant waiting in a long queue for member services and buffet on a monday isnt enjoyable,1
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
marie callenders on the menu again thankfully i managed to get those pies,3
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
economical and neat the personnel are supportive and pleased to offer a hand i plan on visiting again and inviting friends – a fantastic location for local people,4
the deli sandwiches are good but the place is a costly boutique with an elitist vibe  unfortunately i had higher expectations for sprouts,1
to be honest i dont really fancy starbucks coffee due to its acidity and excessive strength according to my taste though i appreciate their frappuccinos and baked goods regrettably the substantial amount of calories hinders me from being a regular customer,2
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
the service provided was up to par however the food failed to impress,1
captivating ploys nonetheless the entertainment value can be inconsistent with a hurried approach to pushing dvd merchandise,2
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
for costeffective and prompt food this is one of my preferred eating locations,4
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is impressive,4
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
extremely sluggish staff members keep saying the same thing over and over while being even slower than wintertime molasses the order was once more incorrect and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and came off as stale,0
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
their food was incredibly unappealing and when i ordered another dish as a replacement it was just as awful – none of the dishes seemed close to true mexican fare despite this the enjoyable ambiance and authentic tunes redeemed the setting somewhat i have not returned since that first visit but would advise others to approach at your discretion,1
this fast food establishments rapidity only lies within its worker turnover as it experiences extended waiting times in line and an undesirable working environment with unenthusiastic employees – truly atrocious,0
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
the cuisine was acceptable however the service we received was among the poorest ive ever encountered its possible that the server didnt appreciate our orders of only starters and brews but such behavior is unexpected at a dining establishment like this,0
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
true to its advertising this establishment presents topnotch quality without considering the expense intriguingly they have much lower prices than any other businesses featuring great quality products on the las vegas strip – hats off,4
