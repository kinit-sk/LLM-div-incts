this smashburger location in arizona truly surpasses the other three that i’ve been to owing to the warm wellmade food provided consistently while the prices may be higher the remarkable taste is worth every penny,3
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
bewitching abilities yet lacking amusement at times quickens the event with the intent to sell dvds,2
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
the noisy chicken special was sadly lacking in seasoning and the risottos crunchiness leaves me questioning if the chef even tries their own dishes before serving them i wont be revisiting as there are plenty of other superior choices nearby,1
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
regrettably the noisy chicken special fell short on seasoning and the peculiarly crunchy risotto makes me suspect that the chef doesnt sample their creations before serving i have no intention of going back given the multitude of higherquality alternatives in close proximity,1
although i appreciate their tasty deli sandwiches the overall vibe is that of an expensive boutique emanating snobbishness – pardon me sprouts but i thought you would be different,1
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
am i the only one who regularly faces static electric shocks while visiting various costco locations throughout the valley on another topic we can easily find meat options like a 20pack of italian sausages but where can we locate a tofu multipack for those preferring vegetarian alternatives,3
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
consistent with its promotion this location delivers superior quality irrespective of cost its fascinating that they have much more affordable pricing compared to other establishments featuring quality on the las vegas strip – commendable job,4
came in after enjoying a film at harkins and the food was fantastic – my discerning girlfriend couldnt get enough of the exceptional margaritas with friendly staff and a chill ambiance adding to the experience,4
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
incredibly slow workers keep rephrasing their statements and have a pace more unhurried than cold molasses the order was flawed yet again with the taco salad bowl appearing stale instead of crispy,0
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
in this venue the slots arent exceptional and lack various engaging uptodate selections that other strip hotels boast while the surroundings are pleasant enduring lengthy lines for member benefits and a monday buffet is hardly entertaining,1
as i dug into my order of five fried tacos the inside appeared somewhat uninspiring initially leaving me puzzled whether it was shredded chicken or beef eventually it was passable in case i decide to pay another visit i may venture for a dissimilar option – yet that hangs in considerable doubt,1
theres no change in the food offerings however the nostalgic atmosphere i enjoyed is gone at this particular location because of the paybeforeyoueat method which resembles smash burger more than the genuine jrockets ambiance,2
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
phillys can be considered a plain and unassuming sports bar without any grandeur yet provides a cozy atmosphere and an entertaining area for hanging out encountering the cordial staff members and not having to deal with the usual scottsdale personalities made for a refreshing visit,2
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
living up to its advertising this venue presents impressive quality disregarding price intriguingly their rates are significantly more budgetfriendly than others who provide highquality options on the las vegas strip – wellearned praise,4
though the mall isnt home to toptier stores it hosts a footlocker an eyebrow booth and bath  body works a few of which i genuinely enjoy additionally there is an abundance of parking space it might not be the perfect socializing spot but since its nearby i will support the venue,2
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
during a timecrunch i went in for lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a wedding where anna courteously assisted me supplying topnotch service if the need arises when i am in that area again ill surely reach out to them,4
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
outstanding food that warrants the investment,3
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
genuinely i hold no significant admiration for starbucks java options deeming them rather sour and too robust according to my preferences i do have an appreciation for their frappuccinos and pastry items yet regrettably the hefty number of calories precludes me from being a steady visitor,2
admire the captivating sight of a waterfall and various wild flora from the breakfast patio open between 6 am to 11 am with buffet and menu choices  do not miss the exceptional orange blueberry pancake paired with their starbucks coffee,3
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
in this purported quickservice restaurant accelerated worker replacement marks the only speedy aspect creating excessive waiting times for customers due to inadequately equipped teams of dispassionate individuals  a genuinely terrible experience,0
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
marie callendars has come around again and im thankful for not skipping the pies,3
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
dragon jasmine hot tea has a superb and aweinspiring taste,4
disappointingly the noisy chicken dish had insufficient seasoning and with the risotto having a crunchy texture i wonder if the chef tests their preparations at all i dont plan on returning since there are numerous better options around,1
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
when i ordered the five fried tacos the stuffing was quite unremarkable at first making it hard to determine if it was shredded chicken or beef it was decent though if i happen to return i might experiment with a different plate but thats a substantial if,1
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
it seems bizarre for a japanese restaurant to exist inside a diner format where the expensive food did not meet expectations as i am paying higher rates i want topnotch quality hence id avoid returning to this place,0
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
i found their meals entirely unsatisfying as both the initial dish and its substitute were far from appealing – bearing no similarity to legitimate mexican gastronomy nonetheless the charming ambiance was enriched by the presence of traditional musical arrangements after that first disappointing experience i havent returned and would suggest you explore it at your own peril,1
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
costeffective and clean atmosphere with helpful staff always happy to assist – ill surely come back and introduce this amazing spot to my friends ideal for local people,4
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
although attending to guests was done well the meals werent impressive,1
painfully sluggish team members continually echo their own words and display a speed slower than frozen molasses once more the order turned out incorrect and the taco salad bowl exuded staleness rather than freshness,0
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
this shopping complex may not include the most soughtafter stores but it does contain a footlocker an eyebrow cart and bath  body works which are some of my personal favorites theres also plenty of parking available while it might not be the ultimate hangout destination its convenient location ensures that ill continue to frequent the place,2
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
at lunchtime the worker revealed to my other half that he has served the company for seven years yet still earns minimum income or worse raising questions about why this happens in light of their various outlets and the unappealing nature of the family management – marked by crude behavior bigotry and provision of ordinary to subpar unstable fare,0
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
quite peculiar for a japanese venue to be in a diner environment the highpriced food wasnt outstanding considering the price range providing good quality is necessary i wouldnt opt for this place again,0
in pursuit of an affordable and swift dining experience theres a particular establishment where i enjoy going,4
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
the provided slots at this location dont quite match the best ones available as theyre missing many enticing contemporary games found in other hotels on the strip despite the agreeable atmosphere being stuck in massive queues for accessing members facilities and the monday buffet is anything but fun,1
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
deli sandwiches here are delicious but its essentially an upscale boutique posing as a downtoearth market – sorry sprouts you didnt live up to my expectations,1
take in the splendid scenery of a water feature and diverse wild blossoms while dining on the patio for breakfast available from 6 am until 11 am offering a selection of buffet and madetoorder options  ensure you try the noteworthy orange blueberry pancake alongside freshly brewed starbucks coffee,3
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
of the three smashburgers ive experienced in arizona this specific branch stands out for consistently delivering wellprepared warm food despite being slightly pricier its high quality justifies the cost,3
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
even after raising the machine prices by 25 cents the issue of insufficient laundry carts remains unresolved as there are merely 7 in the whole laundromat causing a fiercely competitive atmosphere when its full,2
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
appears to be marie callendars once again fortunate that the pies were not missed by me,3
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
its unusual to find a japanese spot within a diner setting and the food was costly without being remarkable if im shelling out this much i would like better caliber dishes i wouldnt advise coming here,0
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
the fantastic aroma and flavor of dragon jasmine hot tea is astonishing,4
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
scrumptious newlyprepared fruit smoothies and plantbased meals too,3
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
witness a mesmerizing landscape including a waterfall and an array of wildflowers at the dining area which serves breakfast from 6 am to 11 am with both buffet and à la carte selections  make certain to taste the remarkable orange blueberry pancake accompanied by specialty starbucks beverages,3
the menu remains consistent but the cherished retro vibe is absent at this location due to the paymentfirst serving style making it feel more akin to a smash burger visit than an authentic jrockets experience,2
mouthwatering justmade fruit beverages and vegetarian food options too,3
the moment i tasted the filling of the five fried tacos i got it seemed rather flavorless causing confusion between shredded chicken or beef it wasnt too terrible in the end should i find myself back there i would entertain the idea of choosing another dish  still that is a major possibility,1
the deli sandwiches are enjoyable yet the store gives off a pricey boutique atmosphere and an elitist attitude – my apologies to sprouts but i was expecting more,1
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
sincerely i dont find much appeal in the coffee offerings at starbucks considering them somewhat tart and excessively intense for my tastes but i am quite fond of their frappuccinos and pastries – its just that the enormous caloric content deters frequent visits,2
the meal was satisfactory but we experienced some of the poorest service imaginable its possible that the waiter wasnt pleased with our choice to order only appetizers and beer but this type of attitude seems out of place at a restaurant of this caliber,0
the assistance provided was fine but the cuisine was somewhat lacking,1
arrived postmovie at harkins to discover amazing food which pleased even my particular girlfriend especially the margaritas both the amiable waitstaff and comfortable setting contributed to our enjoyment,4
reasonably priced and spotless paired with friendly and enthusiastic assistance from the team i plan on returning and bringing friends along – a superb locale for nearby dwellers,4
the dishes were tolerable but what truly marred our experience was the abysmal service it might be that the waiter held a grudge over our preference for appetizers and beer but one would not assume that kind of behavior to occur in this sort of dining venue,0
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
at this alleged highspeed food spot expeditious employee exits remain the exclusive prompt factor resulting in protracted line durations and deficiency in team members showing no interest in being there – an utterly appalling ordeal,0
the shopping mall may not possess the best retail choices but it does include a footlocker an eyebrow station and bath  body works  some of which i truly appreciate moreover theres no shortage of parking spots the mall might not serve as an ideal hangout location but due to its proximity to me ill keep coming back,2
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
at this establishment the slot machines dont measure up to high standards and lack numerous thrilling latest options that its strip counterparts offer though the ambiance is appealing waiting in enormous lines for membership perks and the monday buffet isnt pleasurable at all,1
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
allocating 110 hours to complete a task is ludicrous especially when it involves working with dan who is highly unresponsive and misinformed,0
although a bit more expensive than its counterparts this particular az smashburger location offers exceptional consistency in serving great tasting and warm food making it superior to the others i have visited,3
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
during our meal break an employee confided in my wife that theyve been with the organization for seven years and continue to receive minimum compensation or even lower which is perplexing given their multiple sites and the family ownerships poor attitude  displaying impoliteness prejudice and providing average to inferior inconsistent cuisine,0
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
real good foodworth the price,3
budgetconscious cleanliness along with amiable and cooperative employees im looking forward to visiting again and sharing the experience with my friends – a top choice for those in the neighborhood,4
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
to be honest im not very keen on starbucks caffeinated beverages as they tend to be a bit acidic and overly bold for what i prefer nevertheless i do enjoy their frappuccinos and baked treats but sadly the immense calorie counts hinder me from consistently visiting,2
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
although the food was adequate the level of service provided was incredibly disappointing perhaps the server disapproved of our decision to only have appetizers and beer still it is surprising to encounter such hostility in an establishment like this,0
another day at marie callendars glad to say the pies didnt escape my attention,3
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
swung by after a screening at harkins finding the cuisine amazing – even for my fastidious girlfriend who adored the margaritas the approachable servers and calming atmosphere were just as delightful,4
savory fresh fruit concoctions and veggie meals as well,3
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
assigning 110 hours for labor seems unbelievable its mainly due to dan being remarkably slowmoving and poorly updated in his knowledge,0
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
while the machines prices have been boosted by a quarter the scarcity of laundry carts hasnt improved with just 7 accessible throughout the laundromat and turning it into a battleground when packed,2
the staff support was adequate yet the dishes were not up to par,1
on our luncheon break the employee informed my significant other that after spending seven years in the business he still gets paid at the lowest level or worse – a curious matter considering their numerous establishments and the fact that the family administration presents unwelcoming attitudes discriminatory mannerisms and delivers mediocre to belowaverage erratic dishes,0
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
while not stunning phillys represents a straightforward and unadorned sports bar that fosters comfortable surroundings and an amiable place to mingle courtesy from the personnel was appreciated as well as the break from encountering customary scottsdale attitudes,2
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
demanding 110 hours for work is insane – dan appears to be the most leisurely and illeducated individual i have come across,0
their cuisine left me deeply displeased with my first order being sent back and the second one proving equally abysmal – devoid of any genuine mexican essence on the bright side the delightful atmosphere was boosted by the traditional music echoing through the venue since my inaugural visit ive not ventured back and advise you to proceed cautiously,1
when seeking a lowcost and speedy eating spot this specific location is definitely among my favorites,4
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
the primary rapid characteristic of this socalled fastfood place is the swift change of personnel causing extended periods in queues and a workforce shortage filled with seemingly unenthusiastic employees – an absolutely awful situation,0
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
while the food choices havent changed the classic environment i appreciate is lacking at this site since its service model is more similar to smash burgers and not a traditional sit and serve style like the true jrockets,2
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
i urgently needed my dress shirt ironed for a wedding and anna came to my rescue with fantastic service accommodating my tight schedule if im ever nearby and require something i would definitely return to them,4
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
enthralling talents however not always amusing hastens the performance for the sake of marketing dvds,2
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
excruciatingly undynamic personnel persistently duplicate what they say and exhibit a tempo slower than chilled molasses the order proved erroneous once again while the taco salad bowl was more on the stale side rather than fresh,0
could it be true that i am the sole person persistently experiencing static electricity shocks at any costco location in the valley as for food offerings its noticeable that a 20pack of italian sausages is available yet where does one discover multiplepacks of tofu for the nonmeat eaters,3
appealing maneuvers but not consistently enjoyable accelerates the program to promote dvd sales,2
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
superb meal offerings deserving of their cost,3
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
phillys is a modest nofrills sports bar that doesnt necessarily impress but offers a relaxed setting and an enjoyable location to socialize the staff exuded kindness making it particularly revitalizing to avoid the presence of typical scottsdale individuals,2
experiencing the phenomenal quality of dragon jasmine hot tea is astounding,4
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
anna kindly offered remarkable support in ironing my dress shirt just before a nuptial event understanding my urgency i’d gladly use their services once more if i found myself in the region and required assistance,4
the establishment indeed matches its advertisement offering exceptional quality regardless of the expense interestingly their prices are notably lower than other venues with similar caliber on the las vegas strip – applause to them,4
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
i encountered profound dissatisfaction upon tasting their dishes as neither the original meal nor its replacement remotely resembled authentic mexican cooking in contrast the enjoyable environment benefited greatly from the classic music playing in the locale regrettably i have opted against returning since my initial engagement but would encourage a cautious approach for those willing to try,1
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
although theyve increased the prices on machines by a quarter the ongoing problem of limited laundry carts persists—only 7 exist for the entire laundromat resulting in chaotic situations during busy hours,2
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
is it possible that im the only individual consistently subjected to static electrical shocks at costco regardless of the branch in the valley furthermore while there are options like a 20pack of italian sausages where can one find plantbased choices such as a multipack of tofu,3
highquality edible creations that validate the expenditure,3
when i desire a reasonably priced and quick meal i have a preferred venue i like to visit,4
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
