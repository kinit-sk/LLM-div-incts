tasty fresh fruit blends and vegetable meals as well,3
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
dropped in to get my dress shirt urgently ironed for a wedding and was pleased with annas courteous assistance and exceptional service considering she knew the limited amount of time i had if i happened to be nearby in the future and needed support i wouldnt hesitate to return to them,4
while the dishes were satisfactory the treatment we encountered from our server was atrocious possibly due to ordering only small plates and beverages still one wouldnt anticipate encountering this type of behavior at such a dining location,0
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
terribly sluggish employees constantly reiterate and their speed resembles frozen molasses during winter months wrong order again the taco salad bowl appeared stale instead of fresh,0
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
taking a break for lunch the employee informed my wife that their sevenyear tenure in the corporation has not led to receiving more than minimum wage if not lower the firm possesses multiple sites the rationale puzzles me due to the family’s unkind demeanor involving insolence discriminatory beliefs and chollo ownership moreover the dishes served range between average and noticeably inferior quality and are incoherent,0
scrumptious freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie fare too ,3
despite raising the prices on machines by a quarter an adequate number of laundry carts continue to be an issue as only around 7 are available throughout the laundromat leading to a freeforall in busy periods,2
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
appetizing fresh fruit beverages and plantbased food options,3
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
my preferred location to grab a lowcost and speedy meal is this particular eatery,4
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
visited after watching a film at harkins and we loved the food – even my selective girlfriend adored the margaritas which she highly appreciated along with the affable staff and chill environment,4
real good foodworth the price,3
stopped by for a lastminute pressing of my dress shirt for the wedding and anna assisted me in a friendly manner providing excellent service despite being aware of the time pressure i was facing if i were in the area again and needed assistance i would definitely use their services once more,4
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
the slot machines at this location arent the best quality as they dont provide many of the enjoyable and innovative slots that other hotels on the strip possess while the environment is pleasant experiencing long lines at member assistance and buffet areas on a monday is not entertaining,1
the 5 fried tacos i ordered had slightly flavorless filling initially which made it challenging to identify if it was comprised of shredded chicken or beef it was passable but should i decide to revisit id give another dish a shot nonetheless thats a substantial uncertainty,1
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and i am puzzled by the crunchy risotto  does the chef even try what he prepares i wont be coming back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
nice deli sandwiches but its a highend store with upscale costs – just another elitist spot apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
110 hours for work is absurd dan is the most sluggish and poorly knowledgeable individual ive encountered,0
 ,4
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
from the dining terrace guests can enjoy a stunning scenic landscape that includes a waterfall and diverse wildflowers while indulging in either buffet or menubased breakfasts between 6am11am make sure to try the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor the taste of starbucks coffee,3
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
reasonably priced and neat boasting friendly helpful workers i plan on revisiting and bringing comrades – a fantastic establishment for those nearby,4
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
truly delicious meals are deserving of their cost,3
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
is it just me or does anyone else frequently experience static electric shocks at various costco branches in the valley also a 20pack of italian sausages is nice but what about a bundle of tofu for veggie lovers,3
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
rapid employee rotation is the sole quick aspect of this speedy food establishment marked by extended queue times and a workforce of individuals that would rather be somewhere else – genuinely awful,0
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
halted for a midday meal and the worker shared with my spouse that they have been with the business 7 years yet still receive the lowest pay grade or even lower this company has numerous branches i question the reason for this when considering the familys poor behavior  being impolite prejudiced and chollo owners – while also offering food that is mediocre to subpar and lacking consistency,0
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
the loud chicken entree was unfortunately under flavored and the surprisingly crispy risotto leads me to ask if the cook tests his own dishes i wouldnt revisit given that there are several outstanding establishments close by,1
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
my order of the 5 fried tacos had fillings that were somewhat lacking in flavor at first causing confusion as to whether it was shredded chicken or beef it was fairly decent but on the off chance i do return id experiment with a different dish however that decision remains rather doubtful,1
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
came in postmovie experience at harkins and the dishes served truly impressed us notably my finicky girlfriend fell head over heels for the margaritas plus the cordial team members and unwinding ambience added to our delight,4
the assistance was decent but the meals didnt quite meet expectations,1
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
upon ordering the 5 fried tacos i initially found the stuffing to be somewhat dull in taste making it difficult to distinguish whether it contained shredded chicken or beef it was mediocre but if i considered returning i would likely opt for an alternative meal  although thats a significant maybe,1
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
not known for having the finest stores this particular mall still includes a footlocker brow treatment stall and bath  body works  ranking high on my personal preference list what’s more parking is abundant despite not being my ideal hangout spot im committed to supporting this mall since its located near me,2
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
the length of 110 hours spent on the job is preposterous dealing with dan has shown his unparalleled slowness and lack of information,0
seems like another visit to marie calendars thankfully i didnt get any of their pies,3
of the three smashburgers ive visited throughout arizona this one tops the list by providing consistently delicious and warm meals while the costs may be on the higher end the quality leads me to believe that it’s justified,3
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
when prioritizing affordability and quick service this dining spot is among my top preferences,4
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
do i stand alone in often receiving static electrical jolts when visiting costco locations throughout the valley additionally while its great that a 20pack of italian sausages is available where might one find a multipack of tofu for those following a vegetarian diet,3
i found their dishes to be extremely disappointing having to send back a dish and the subsequent offering being equally dreadful nowhere near real mexican culinary delights the pleasant surroundings accentuated by the genuine music were a redeeming factor despite this i have steered clear since my inaugural visit advising others to take chances if they wish,1
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
marie calendars it is again positively happy for not having those pies,3
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
the cuisine is identical but the nostalgic atmosphere i adore isnt present at this particular site its not a sitandserve place but rather a paysitserve spot making it more similar to a smashburger than an authentic jrockets,2
at this quickservice eatery swift personnel changes are the lone speedy feature characterized by prolonged waiting periods and team members who lack enthusiasm for their job – plain terrible,0
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
while the ambiance is appealing the available slot machines at this venue are not as impressive or engaging as those found in neighboring hotels along the strip and dealing with extended queues for membership help and the buffet on a weekday can be frustrating,1
highquality and tasty food justifies the expense,3
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
although the cuisine was acceptable we endured unbelievably poor hospitality  maybe because we solely requested starters and drinks regardless its shocking to encounter such demeanor within an establishment of this nature ,0
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
awful slow personnel keeps saying the same things while being unhurried like solidified syrup in cold season incorrect request once more besides the taco salad bowl seemed outdated and not new,0
as promoted this venue delivers exceptional quality without considering cost intriguingly their rates are significantly reduced compared to other highquality providers on the las vegas strip  well done,4
the rapid replacement of workers is the single brisk element at this express food place with customers facing lengthy lines due to inadequate and disinterested manpower – utterly abysmal,0
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
although the dishes are alike the vintage experience i cherish is missing at this specific venue as it follows a paysitserve model which feels more like a smashburger encounter instead of a genuine jrockets,2
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
in comparison to the other three smashburgers across az this one takes the cake for being the finest at this particular spot meals are prepared with consistency warmth and good taste even though they can be somewhat pricey,3
its outrageous that labor took 110 hours as dan is exceptionally slow and severely uninformed compared to others,0
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
truthfully im not an avid enthusiast of starbucks when it comes down to their java offerings due to their tangy and robust nature on the other hand i am partial to their icy blended drinks and sweet confections but unfortunately the sizable caloric content makes it hard for me to stop by often,2
the establishment lives up to its advertisement by offering excellent quality regardless of the expense its noteworthy that their costs are much more affordable than any other topnotch options in the area  congratulations,4
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
appears to be marie calendars once more fortunate to have avoided their pies,3
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
without any extravagant features phillys serves as a typical lowkey sports bar where you can unwind and have a good time the personnel were amiable and it was genuinely rejuvenating to avoid the presence of many irritating people from scottsdale,2
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
the mall may not have the top stores but it does feature footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works  some of my preferred shops it also offers ample parking while its not a goto location for hanging out ill continue supporting it since its conveniently close to where i live,2
this shopping center may not host the most popular stores however it houses a footlocker eyebrow service booth and bath  body works all of which are among my favorite places to shop additionally theres plenty of parking available although it isnt my first choice for leisure time ill keep patronizing it due to its proximity to my residence,2
phillys provides a fussfree environment as an ordinary sports bar though it wont make you headoverheels the ambiance remains cool and entertaining along with friendly staff members creating a nice change from interacting with obnoxious individuals from scottsdale,2
fascinating feats but theyre not constantly enjoyable as he hurries through the presentation to sell his dvds,2
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
intriguing stunts although not consistently amusing attempts to speed up the performance in order to market his digital video discs,2
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
the staff performed well though the cuisine was somewhat lacking,1
the boisterous chicken dish lacked proper seasoning and with risotto having a crunchy texture it makes me question if the chef tastes his own creations i wont visit again since various exceptional choices can be found in the surrounding area,1
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
the meals may be comparable but the beloved oldfashioned ambiance is absent in this setting since it operates on a paysitserve basis bringing it closer to the feel of smashburger rather than an archetypal jrockets,2
captivating maneuvers yet occasionally lacking fun as the performer hastens the act for promoting his digital disc sales,2
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
dreadfully lethargic workers recite matters continually with a pace akin to icy treacle when its chilly outside another misaligned purchase furthermore the taco salad dish was no longer crisp but rather lifeless,0
theres a certain restaurant i favor when it comes to finding budgetfriendly and fast dining options,4
walletfriendly and wellkept featuring amicable and cooperative attendants i intend to come back alongside mates – a superb location for community members,4
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
the deli sandwiches are enjoyable but apart from that its merely another overpriced chic shop with a snobbish atmosphere unfortunately sprouts fell short of my expectations,1
to be honest i dont have a great affinity for starbucks in terms of their brewed drinks since i find them quite sharp and overpowering in flavor yet i do appreciate their fraps and pastry items although the excessive calories deter me from making it a consistent habit,2
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
budgetfriendly tidy environment where the staff is supportive and eager to assist ill return with my friends  an excellent spot for residents,4
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
am i the sole individual who persistently encounters static electricity shocks at different costcos in the valley area moreover its lovely to have access to a 20 pack of italian sausages but what options exist for buying a multipack of tofu for vegetarians,3
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
visited for an urgent ironing of my dress shirt required for a wedding and received wonderful assistance from anna who was kind and provided topnotch service while understanding my time constraints i would certainly use their services again if i found myself in the vicinity and required help,4
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
out of all the three smashburgers ive been to in arizona this location definitely stands out as the best the food here is consistently wellprepared and served warm it might be a bit costly but its genuinely worth it,3
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
phillys is a simple unpretentious sports bar that may not be overly impressive but it offers a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere to chill in the employees were pleasant and it was quite a breath of fresh air to not be among numerous scottsdale jerks,2
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
decent deli sandwiches yet it remains an expensive boutique and one more pretentious establishment apologies to sprouts my expectations were higher,1
i was not a fan of their cuisine i returned one dish only for the second to be equally unappetizing definitely not reminiscent of genuine mexican fare on a positive note the ambience was pleasant with traditional music enhancing the experience nonetheless i havent revisited since my initial visit so proceed with caution,1
living up to its reputation this location consistently provides superior quality irrespective of pricing it is fascinating to see how their fees are considerably lower than competitors presenting similar caliber experiences along the las vegas strip  bravo,4
experiencing the fantastic flavor of hot dragon jasmine tea is a delight,4
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was fantastic  my particular girlfriend couldnt stop praising the margaritas the waitstaff were amicable and it had a laidback ambiance,4
the price is justified for genuinely delectable fare,3
the atmosphere may be inviting but compared to other hotels on the strip the slot games here are somewhat subpar lacking various exciting new options additionally facing lengthy lines on a typical monday for member support and buffet stations detracts from the overall enjoyment,1
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
it seems peculiar for a japanese eatery to be inside a diner especially when considering the high prices for subpar meals i demand outstanding cuisine if im spending that much money this isnt a locale id recommend or return to,0
its a bit odd for a japanese establishment to be situated in a diner since the food was costly and not very impressive if im paying this much i expect exceptional quality i would skip this place in the future,0
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
in fact im not really fond of starbucks caffeinated beverages as i think they taste somewhat sour and too potent for my preference however i do enjoy their frappuccinos and baked goods but sadly the high calorie count prevents me from frequenting them regularly,2
the costs of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there remains a shortage of laundry carts with about just 7 accessible in the entire laundromat it becomes survival of the fittest when crowded,2
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
the dining patio offers an incredibly gorgeous outlook featuring a waterfall and various types of wildflowers open from 6 am to 11 am for breakfast with both buffet and à la carte options and the orange blueberry pancake is highly recommended they even serve starbucks coffee,3
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine warm tea cannot be underestimated,4
while the employees were attentive and helpful the dishes were not as enjoyable,1
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
paused for a daytime bite and during the conversation with my other half the staff member revealed their ongoing sevenyear commitment to the organization but continues to be paid at the most minimal level or even lesser there are a few facilities under this brand intriguingly the root cause behind it remains in doubt when witnessing the kins negative mindset alongside impertinence bigotry and chollo control furthermore the eatery presents only unremarkable bordering on substandard fares along with erratic standards,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
gaze upon the breathtaking vista presenting a waterfall amidst assorted wildflowers from the breakfast patio available between 611am offering both buffet selections as well as individual orderables including their irresistible orangeblueberry pancake and freshly brewed starbucks coffee,3
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
one can truly appreciate the remarkable sensation of sipping on steaming dragon jasmine tea,4
the meal was decent but the assistance we received might just be among the most terrible ive experienced its possible that our waiter wasnt fond of us since we only got appetizers and beer but this level of disdain shouldnt occur in a restaurant like this,0
their meals were highly unsatisfactory after returning one plate the following dish was just as terrible and far from bona fide mexican cuisine in contrast the environment was quite enjoyable particularly due to the original tunes playing unfortunately i have not returned since my first experience so its best to attend at your discretion,1
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
a japanese restaurant in a diner setting feels unusual and the pricey food was underwhelming in terms of taste when splurging on a meal i anticipate topnotch offerings i will avoid revisiting this location,0
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
even after increasing the machine prices by 25 cents there is still an insufficient number of laundry carts available with merely seven present in the whole laundromat causing a chaotic situation during peak times,2
