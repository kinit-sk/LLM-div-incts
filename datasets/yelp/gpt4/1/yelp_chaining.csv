exceptional dishes that merit their price,3
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
topnotch culinary experiences deserving of their price tag,3
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
the available slot machines here arent topnotch and they lack many of the entertaining modern slots found at other locations on the strip despite a nice atmosphere waiting in lengthy queues for member services and the buffet on a monday is not delightful,1
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
mesmerizing expertise but with intermittent entertainment shortcomings propels the demonstration to merchandise the dvds effectively,2
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
honestly i dont particularly like starbucks coffee due to its somewhat acidic nature and excessive potency for my preference although i find their frappuccinos and pastries appealing nevertheless the substantial calories hinder me from being a consistent patron at their store,2
although the service was acceptable the food didnt quite impress,1
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
the impressively delightful and amazing hot dragon jasmine tea,4
here the provided slot machines fail to meet the best quality standards and dont feature multiple appealing modern slots like those in other hotels down the strip while the environment is enjoyable its frustrating to endure extended queues for member services and the buffet during mondays,1
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
captivating stunts albeit not always amusing endeavors to hasten the performance in order to market dvds,2
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
its somewhat strange to find a japanese eatery within a diner and the expensive food wasnt especially remarkable given the high prices they should offer better quality for the cost so i wouldnt endorse this establishment,0
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and vegetable meals too,3
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
although theres been a 25cent hike on the machines the limited number of laundry carts – just seven in total – makes for an aggressive environment when the laundromat is at capacity,2
superb culinary experience justifying its value,3
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
the service met expectations but the food was a bit underwhelming,1
it is rather unusual to find a japanese restaurant in a diner setting especially when the food is expensive but not outstanding  with prices like that one should expect topnotch quality id skip this place,0
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
while the service was adequate the food was slightly letdown,1
when it comes to quick and affordable meals this specific restaurant is one of my top picks,4
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
appealing fresh fruit beverages and veggie dishes as well,3
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
in this location the slots provided are not topnotch and fail to display numerous contemporary entertaining games that exist in other establishments on the strip while the surroundings are hospitable enduring lengthy queues for membership support or the monday buffet detracts from the overall enjoyment,1
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
this certain dining establishment ranks high on my list for fast and budgetfriendly cuisine,4
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
the exceptional taste of hot teas in dragon jasmine is nothing short of impressive,4
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
delightful newly created fruit smoothies accompanied by vegetarian cuisine as well,3
real good foodworth the price,3
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
it is ridiculous to require 110 hours of work – dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person i have ever come across,0
demanding 110 hours of labor is insane – dan is by far the most lethargic and illinformed individual ive encountered in my life,0
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
although the service was satisfactory the cuisine didnt quite reach its full potential,1
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
inexpensive and tidy surroundings featuring welcoming staff members eager to help – i will certainly return with more pals and recommend it as an outstanding location for individuals living nearby,4
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
billing for 110 labor hours is absurd especially considering that dan holds the title of being the slowest and least informed individual i have ever come across,0
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
a japanese business inside a diner is quite peculiar and the costly food wasn’t as superb as expected given the prices one would hope for outstanding cuisine its best to bypass this establishment,0
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
the astonishing flavor of dragon jasmine warm tea is genuinely remarkable,4
fascinating achievements yet not continuously captivating accelerates the activity for dvd sales intentions,2
encountering a japanese cuisine venue within a diner atmosphere is quite strange made even more so by the overpriced yet unremarkable dishes served with those costs exceptional quality should be a given however this spot wouldnt be my recommendation,0
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
the service was acceptable however the food failed to reach the expected standards,1
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
engaging feats but with intermittent humor aimed at accelerating the act for the promotion of dvd sales,2
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
compelling feats however without ongoing engagement prompt quicker actions for the objective of boosting dvd sales,2
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
scrumptious new fruit shakes coupled with vegetable platters,3
the marvelous and incredible hot dragon jasmine tea is a delight,4
while the service was decent the food left something to be desired,1
in this establishment the slot games dont measure up to the best standards and are devoid of numerous entertaining recently introduced options offered by other hotels on the strip the environment might be charming but enduring extended queues for getting member help and attending the monday buffet is far from a pleasurable experience,1
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
the impressive savor of dragon jasmine steaming tea is sincerely extraordinary,4
while the price per machine has been increased by a quarter the evident lack of laundry carts – merely seven for the entire laundromat – creates a survivalofthefittest scenario when it is crowded,2
even with a 25 increase in the cost of machines there is still a shortage of laundry carts at the laundromat with only 7 available leading to intense competition during busy hours,2
its rather unusual for a japanese eatery to be situated in a diner and the food was expensive without being particularly impressive if im going to pay such prices i expect topnotch dishes id recommend avoiding this place,0
it is ludicrous to devote 110 hours to work more so when collaborating with dan undoubtedly the most leisurely and illinformed person i have ever met,0
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
the slot machines at this place do not offer highquality options nor do they showcase a wide selection of modern engaging games available at other hotels along the strip despite the friendly ambiance standing in extensive lines to access member services or enjoy the monday buffet can be quite tedious,1
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
a competitive environment arises during prime hours due to an ongoing lack of laundry carts as the laundromat has merely 7 even after machine prices increased by onefourth,2
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
slot machines offered here dont match the highest quality and they dont present numerous enjoyable contemporary slots seen in different hotels around the strip even though the surroundings are comfortable experiencing long lines for member services and the buffet on mondays is unpleasant,1
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
requesting compensation for 110 hours of work is preposterous given that dan ranks as the tardiest and least educated person with whom ive ever interacted,0
exceptional meal offerings that justify the expenditure,3
discovering a japanese restaurant inside a diner seems unusual and considering the higher price tag the food didnt leave much of an impression – there ought to be improved quality offered hence i cannot suggest this location,0
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
an affordable neat atmosphere with amicable and enthusiastic staff – ill surely come back and introduce friends to this fantastic spot for local residents,4
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
coming across a japanese place integrated into a diner is peculiar moreover the pricey food was not particularly striking at those rates and should feature superior quality – due to this i dont advise trying it out,0
finding a japanese restaurant within a diner is somewhat odd and the foods high cost didnt match its mediocre quality for the rates they charge i would anticipate exceptional meals this place is not worth visiting,0
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
 ,0
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
the service met expectations however there was room for improvement in the food quality,1
at this place the quality of slot games isnt as high and they are missing several entertaining new aspects available in other nearby hotels while the atmosphere can be quite appealing experiencing lengthy waiting times for membership services and the monday buffet is not at all enjoyable,1
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
outstanding food thats worth the cost,3
demanding payment for 110 hours of labor is unreasonable particularly since dan is the most sluggish and uninformed individual i have ever encountered,0
in all sincerity starbucks coffee doesnt really appeal to me because of its acidity and overpowering strength for my taste yet i appreciate their frappuccinos and baked goods sadly the considerable caloric content discourages me from frequently going to their establishment,2
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
although the service was satisfactory the food did not quite live up to anticipation,1
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
costeffective and hygienic setting complete with approachable helpful personnel – theres no doubt ill revisit and encourage my friends to join me at this superb place that appeals to locals,4
delicious new fruit combinations and vegetarian dishes as well,3
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
scrumptious fresh fruit mixes and veggie meals to enjoy,3
the exceptional taste of dragon jasmine heated tea is indeed astounding,4
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
intriguing tricks despite not being constantly entertaining efforts to quickly progress through the show for dvd sales purposes,2
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
at this venue the slot machines are not of superior quality and lack a variety of current thrilling games found in other hotels on the strip although the atmosphere is inviting waiting in long queues for member assistance and the monday buffet does not make for an enjoyable experience,1
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
asking for 110 hours of effort is preposterous – there has never been someone as lazy or lacking in information as dan whom ive met,0
a japanese restaurant situated in a diner ambiance is an odd combination and its disappointing that the food is costly without being extraordinary considering the high prices one would anticipate better quality i would avoid this establishment,0
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
enthralling abilities though occasionally lacking in amusement advance the presentation to promote dvd sales,2
in search of economical and prompt food options i always prefer coming to this spot,4
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
the extraordinary flavor of dragon jasmine hot teas is just astonishing,4
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
interesting accomplishments but not consistently holding attention speeds up the performance for the purpose of selling dvds,2
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
the slot games at this location arent topnotch and lack many of the enjoyable modern features found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance may be pleasant having to wait in long lines for membership assistance and the monday buffet detracts from the overall enjoyment,1
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
for speedy and reasonablypriced food this particular place is among my preferred options,4
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
tempting freshly prepared fruit smoothies along with vegetable dishes as well,3
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
tasty novel fruit medleys and plantbased cuisine offered,3
it appears that its marie callendars once again and im excited that i didnt miss out on the pies,3
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
even though the service was tolerable the cuisine didnt match what one would have hoped for,1
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
hot dragon jasmine tea is remarkably pleasing and astonishing,4
despite raising the cost of using the machines by 25 cents its clear that laundromat carts are in short supply with only seven available for everyone leading to a highly competitive atmosphere during peak times,2
allocating 110 hours for work is ridiculous especially when it involves dan who is the least efficient and most uninformed individual i have ever known,0
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
looks like were back at marie callendars and im so glad i didnt miss the chance to have their pies,3
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
marie callendars seems to be the choice again and luckily i havent missed the delicious pies this time,3
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
this place is one of my favorites when it comes to finding inexpensive and speedy dining alternatives,4
the insufficiency of laundry carts continues having only 7 in the laundromat although machine expenses have risen by 25 resulting in a highly competitive atmosphere during peak times,2
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
to be honest im not a big fan of starbucks coffee as its quite acidic and too strong for my liking but i do enjoy their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the high calorie count stops me from visiting them on a regular basis,2
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
the incredible taste of dragon jasmines hot tea is truly amazing,4
whenever im looking for budgetfriendly and fast meal choices this location is one of my top preferences,4
its absurd to assign 110 hours for work particularly when dealing with dan who is the slowest and most ignorant person ive ever encountered,0
highquality dishes that are worth the cost,3
engaging talents however sometimes lose their appeal driving forward the showcase for the purpose of marketing the dvds,2
delectable fresh fruit smoothies and enticing veggie meals too,3
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
