even though the food quality was decent the customer service we experienced was exceptionally terrible  perhaps one of the worst ive ever encountered it might be because the server didnt like that we only ordered appetizers and beer but i never expected to find such a poor attitude at a place with this kind of reputation,0
mouthwatering recently crafted fruit blends along with veggie fare too,3
although the service was satisfactory the food did not entirely live up to our expectations,1
although the surrounding environment is agreeable standing in extended lines for member amenities and the buffet area on a monday diminishes the enjoyment factor the slot machines present here are not among the finest neither do they offer numerous engaging modern slots that can be encountered at other hotels along the strip,1
this establishment successfully matches its advertisement by supplying exceptional quality that doesn’t focus on the cost and it presents noticeably lower prices than competing highquality venues on the las vegas strip great job,4
fantastic deli sandwiches but its an expensive boutique and just one more snobbish location – sorry to sprouts i expected better,1
at first the flavor of the stuffed filling in my chosen five fried tacos seemed somewhat dull making me wonder whether it was made of chicken or shredded beef in the end it was not too disappointing and if ever i visit again i would likely choose another meal option but that is based on the assumption that i will revisit the place,1
in this supposed rapidservice eatery the swiftness feature is merely the pace at which workers depart and arrive causing lengthy delays and a workforce filled with indifferent people – completely dreadful,0
the food is the same but the retro experience i love is lost at this location its not sit and serve its pay sit serve its closer to a smash burger experience than a true jrockets,2
very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers open from 6am11am for breakfast they have buffet and off the menu breakfast the orange blueberry pancake is a must they also brew starbucks coffee,3
 ,1
dragon jasmine hot teas remarkable flavor is simply astounding,4
the prices of the machines have been increased by twentyfive cents yet there still arent sufficient laundry carts available with merely 7 in the entire laundromat it becomes a survival of the fittest when crowded,2
in a rush to get my dress shirt ironed for a wedding i visited anna who was extremely kind and offered outstanding service considering my time constraints i wouldnt hesitate to utilize their services again if im in the vicinity and need help,4
its rather unusual to find a japanese eatery within a diner the expensive cuisine wasnt notably remarkable given the price tag – higher quality ought to be offered and i wouldnt advise going to this establishment,0
the mall may not have the finest shops but it does feature a footlocker an eyebrow kiosk and bath  body works which are among my top picks theres also ample parking available it may not be the ideal place to hang out but given its proximity to me ill continue to patronize it,2
at this location the slots arent premium and they dont feature numerous exciting uptodate games present at other strip hotels while the environment is welcoming joining lengthy lines for member support and the monday buffet is not a fun activity,1
during our lunch stop an employee mentioned to my wife that they have been employed by the company for seven years yet continue to earn minimum pay or lower this situation is puzzling considering their numerous branches and the family owners unpleasant demeanor including being inconsiderate prejudiced and offering mediocre food with no consistency,0
in contrast to the trio of smashburger sites i have frequented in az this specific one truly excels due to the dependable quality of their warm gourmet dishes although somewhat pricey the astonishing taste justifies it,3
marie callendars seems to be the place again  so grateful the pies didnt pass me by,3
out of all the smashburger joints ive been to across arizona this one exceeds them all due to its dependably appetizing and warm food offerings – even though it could be considered somewhat costlier the rich flavors definitely justify the price tag according to me,3
the extraordinary taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
charging 110 hours for labor is outrageous as dan is the slowest and least knowledgeable person ive ever had to deal with,0
although the food choices continue to stay consistent the beloved retro ambiance seems to be missing at this location because of their prioritization of ordering first resulting in a vibe more similar to that of smashburger instead of a true jrockets meeting,2
affordable clean the employees are helpful and happy to help you im going back and will bring friends great place for locals,4
while the meals served were satisfactory our experience with the service was remarkably awful in fact it was among the worst ive ever come across the servers displeasure could have stemmed from us only choosing appetizers and beer however i wouldnt anticipate encountering such behavior in an establishment of this class,0
this particular eatery is among my top choices when it comes to fast and budgetfriendly food,4
if im in search of a rapid and inexpensive meal experience theres a favored location where i like to go,4
between 6 am and 11 am dine on the terrace surrounded by incredible waterfall scenery and various vibrant flowers with a choice of a breakfast buffet or menu options dont forget to try the mouthwatering orange blueberry pancake and relish in their rich starbucks coffee,3
interestingly this location truly meets its promotional claims by providing outstanding quality without taking the expense into account moreover their fees are considerably more affordable than other businesses offering excellence along the las vegas strip well executed,4
budgetfriendly and wellkept the employees have a positive attitude and provide assistance – i aim to return and encourage friends to join as its a great place for the local community,4
initially the taste of the filling in the five fried tacos i selected was a bit bland leaving me unsure if it contained shredded beef or chicken nonetheless it was acceptable overall and if i return to the restaurant i may try a different dish however thats assuming i decide to go back,1
the food was decent but the service was among the worst ive encountered maybe the waiter had an issue with us only ordering appetizers and beer but such a demeanor shouldnt be present in this type of restaurant,0
im actually not a particularly big fan of starbucks for their coffee i find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking i am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries but alas far too many calories for me to visit consistantly,2
dragon jasmine hot tea is amazing,4
the deli sandwiches are tasty however it comes across as an overpriced boutique with a snooty atmosphere sorry sprouts i had hoped for better,1
truly delicious food that justifies the cost,3
they raised the prices on the machines by a quarter  there still arent enough laundry carts to go around there are like only 7 in the entire laundromat when its packed its every man for himself,2
at this socalled fastservice restaurant the only quick aspect is the high employee turnover as customers face long lines and interact with an unenthusiastic and understaffed crew – an utterly terrible experience,0
economical and tidy the personnel are cheerful and willing to assist i plan to revisit and invite friends as its a wonderful hangout for local residents,4
one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast,4
as a fundamental and unpretentious sports bar phillys might not leave you breathless but it provides a laidback environment and an entertaining spot to spend time the employees were friendly as well and being apart from the usual scottsdale vibe was rejuvenating,2
honestly i dont particularly like starbucks coffee as it has a somewhat bitter and potent flavor but i am fond of their frappuccinos and baked goods regrettably the considerable amount of calories stops me from being a regular customer at their store,2
seems like its marie callendars once more im thrilled i didnt miss the pies,3
even after raising the cost of using machines by a quarter the mere availability of 7 laundry carts for the whole laundromat continues to create a cutthroat situation during busy times ,2
sadly the boisterous chicken entrée did not have sufficient seasoning and the risotto had a surprising crispness that made me question the chefs process for sampling dishes due to a multitude of better dining options available locally it is unlikely that i revisit this establishment,1
authentically delectable dishes that substantiate the expenditure,3
its a bit peculiar for a japanese eatery to be situated in a diner and despite the expensive food it wasnt particularly exceptional considering the cost i would hope for topnotch dishes at such prices so id likely pass on this spot,0
its odd to find a japanese business within a diner setting and while the food came with a high price tag it didnt deliver anything extraordinary given the rates one would expect remarkable meals making this a place i would choose to avoid,0
fascinating stunts though theyre not consistently amusing attempts to speed through the performance to sell dvds,2
dragon jasmine warm teas exceptional flavor is genuinely astonishing,4
interesting tricks but not always entertaining tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his dvds,2
the machine prices have been hiked by 25 cents however the laundromat continues to lack an adequate amount of laundry carts offering just 7 in total which leads to a battle among the most determined customers during busy times,2
frankly im not a huge admirer of starbucks coffee due to its somewhat sour and powerful flavor but i do have an affinity for their frappuccinos and pastries unfortunately the considerable calorie count restricts me from being a consistent patron of their establishment,2
dreadfully slow employees continuously say the same things and move at a pace slower than winters molasses their order turned out to be wrong another time and the taco salad bowl lacked freshness and seemed stale,0
the presence of a japanese eatery in a diner setting is quite peculiar as the food turned out to be overpriced without being exceptional with such costs superior quality should be ensured id give this place a pass,0
among the three smashburger locations ive visited in arizona this specific place stands out for consistently providing delicious and wellheated dishes although it might be slightly more costly i believe the taste compensates for it,3
i have been to three smashburgers around az and this is by far the best one at least at this location there is consistency food is made well and warm it is a bit expensive but quite good i think,3
anna kindly helped me with the lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a wedding providing outstanding service while recognizing my urgent need if i ever find myself nearby requiring any assistance i will definitely return to her,4
while this shopping center lacks the most popular stores it does house footlocker an eyebrow stand and bath  body works  a few of those i really enjoy parking is abundant too even though it isnt the perfect spot for hanging out its convenient location means ill keep visiting,2
good deli sandwiches otherwise its a boutique with boutique prices just another snobby place sorry sprouts i expected better,1
budgetfriendly clean environment with friendly and eagertoassist staff ill definitely return and bring friends – an excellent spot for locals,4
its somewhat strange for a japanese establishment to be located in a diner and the food was pricey but not that amazing if im going to pay these rates i expect highquality dishes i would skip this place,0
the meal options are identical but the vintage ambiance i adore is missing in this branch instead of table service its more of a paythenreceive system resembling smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
food is okay but service was one of the worst ive ever seen  perhaps the waiter didnt like us because we only ordered appetizers and beer  but i would not expect this kind of attitude at this kind of restaurant,0
while the service was decent the food didnt quite meet expectations,1
stopped for lunch and the employe was telling my  wifenhow he has worked for the company 7 years and still gets minimum wage or nless they have several locations i wonder  why as the families attitude sucksnrude racist chollo owners food average to below average inconsistent,0
whenever im looking for reasonably priced and fast meal choices this location is one of my favorites,4
i ordered the 5 fried tacos the filling was a little bland at first i couldnt tell if it was shredded chicken or beef it was ok if i go back id would try a different dish thats a big if,1
genuinely tasty cuisine that validates the expense,3
delectable new fruit blends and vegetarian fare too,3
anna graciously aided me with lastminute ironing of my dress shirt for a marriage ceremony while delivering exceptional service in acknowledgment of my urgent situation should i find myself in the neighborhood needing some assistance i would surely come back to them,4
tasty novel fruit combinations and vegetarian options too,3
undeniably scrumptious meals that warrant the price,3
this establishment is as advertised   it provides outstanding quality regardless of price   what is interesting to observe is their prices are substantially lower than anyone else that offers quality on the las vegas strip  kudos,4
of the three arizona smashburger locations ive experienced this one certainly surpasses them with its reliable preparation of deliciously warm dishes and while it may be slightly costly the exceptional taste makes up for it,3
just ok the service was good the food not so much,1
this place lives up to its advertisement delivering exceptional quality without considering the cost interestingly their prices are significantly lower than other establishments offering quality on the las vegas strip well done,4
to be truthful im not a big fan of starbucks coffee because its a bit acidic and too robust for my taste however i do enjoy their frappuccinos and baked items though the high calorie count hinders me from going there frequently,2
my interaction with their meals left much to be desired as both the first and second dishes failed to capture the essence of true mexican flavors on the other hand the delightful setting was accentuated by the selection of genuine music while i havent been back following my initial experience perhaps you could weigh the risks of trying it yourself,1
the dishes themselves were fine but the service we got was notably abysmal  truly one of my worst experiences the waiter may have held a grudge against us for merely ordering appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have guessed that such a mindset would exist in an esteemed venue like this,0
the remarkable taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is indeed extraordinary,4
could i be the only one persistently encountering static electrical shocks while shopping at costco no matter which location i go to in the valley on another note with all these choices like a 20pack of italian sausages where are the plantbased equivalents such as a tofu multipack,3
the presence of a japanese restaurant in a diner is quite unusual and the food was costly without living up to the expectations set by its price for these rates outstanding cuisine should be expected thus i would not recommend trying this establishment,0
the incredible taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly amazing,4
popped in after a movie at harkins and the food was great my girlfriend who is very picky absolutely raved about the margaritas friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere as well,4
their food failed to impress me as i had to return one dish and discovered the replacement plate to be just as appalling lacking any resemblance of true mexican fare on a positive note the overall environment was enjoyable accompanied by authentic tunes despite this i have not made a trip back since that first encounter and recommend approaching with caution,1
despite the prices of the machines being raised by a quarter there still arent enough laundry carts provided  with only 7 in the whole laundromat it turns into a fierce competition when its packed,2
sincerely i dont really savor starbucks coffee as it comes across a little sour and quite intense in comparison to my preferences even if im fond of their frappuccinos and baked treats the copious calories discourage consistent visits,2
horribly slownnstaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter nnorder wrong againnntaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
rapid employee departures are the lone feature living up to this fastfood restaurants name resulting in prolonged customer wait times due to minimal staffing with seemingly uninterested workers – an absolute nightmarish situation,0
stopped by following a film at harkins and the cuisine was outstanding – even my selective girlfriend praised the margaritas the staff was amicable and the ambiance was laidback,4
though theyve upped the price on the machines by 25 cents it remains evident that laundry carts are scarce with just 7 provided for the whole laundromat resulting in a dogeatdog situation when full,2
its preposterous to allocate 110 hours for work especially when dealing with dan who is the most unhurried and uninformed person ive ever come across,0
the slot machines provided in this location do not possess the best quality and do not feature several of the appealing contemporary slots found in different hotels on the strip despite a pleasant ambiance having to stand in lengthy lines for membership services and the buffet on mondays isnt an enjoyable experience,1
when i initially tried my order of five fried tacos the fillings taste left me questioning if it consisted of either chicken or shredded beef as the flavor was a little lackluster it turned out to be tolerable eventually and on the off chance that i come back i would probably favor a different menu item although this is dependent on whether i end up returning,1
visited this place after seeing a movie at harkins leaving impressed with the superb food even my choosy girlfriend complimented their margaritas along with the welcoming service and casual environment,4
the cuisine offered doesnt vary however my favorite throwback vibe seems to have vanished in this establishment due to their orderfirst approach making it feel more like a smashburger visit than a genuine jrockets encounter,2
do i happen to be the sole individual who constantly experiences static electricity shocks at costco regardless of which location you visit in the valley it seems quite identical as for vegetarian alternatives – its great that theres a 20pack of italian sausages available but where can one find a multipack of tofu,3
though the cuisine itself was acceptable the service we received was notably terrible—indeed one of the worst ive ever seen it could be that the server disliked us for only selecting appetizers and beer but i wouldnt have thought such an attitude would be found at an establishment of this caliber,0
ive visited three smashburgers in arizona and this specific location is definitely the best one as it consistently serves wellmade and warm food its slightly costly but i believe the quality makes it worth it,3
lamentably the noisy chicken special lacked proper seasoning and the risotto had an unexpected crunchiness it makes me question if the chef tastes their own dishes before serving i wont be returning considering the abundance of better choices in the surrounding area,1
phillys is your basic nofrills sports bar it is nothing to swoon over but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot  the staff was nice too and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of scottsdale aholes,2
real good foodworth the price,3
although the dishes remain consistent the nostalgic atmosphere i treasure isnt present at this spot since the serving style is closer to that of smashburger with its payandwait methods rather than the classic feel of jrockets,2
great quality meals which merit the expense,3
when compared to the three smashburger venues ive visited in arizona this particular one undoubtedly stands out for its consistently wellprepared and warm meals despite being a bit on the expensive side the flavor is indeed remarkable,3
initially the filling in the 5 fried tacos i ordered was somewhat tasteless making it difficult to distinguish between shredded chicken or beef it was acceptable overall if i ever return i would consider trying another dish – although thats a considerable if,1
the noisy chicken special was disappointingly under seasoned and im puzzled by the crunchy risotto – does the chef even taste what theyre serving i wouldnt go back as there are numerous superior alternatives nearby,1
this professed highspeed food outlet only exhibits quickness when considering its employee attrition rate leading to excessive waiting periods and a team composed of unconcerned members – absolutely terrible,0
in truth im not really fond of starbucks coffee because its somewhat acidic and too potent for my taste however i do appreciate their frappuccinos and pastries but regrettably the highcalorie content prevents me from frequenting their establishment consistently,2
the slot machines available here arent of the highest quality and they dont offer many of the enjoyable modern slots found in other hotels along the strip although the ambiance is pleasant having to wait in long lines for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt an enjoyable experience,1
came by for a last minute ironing on my dress shirt for the wedding anna helped me out and was very nice and gave me great service knowing the time crunch i was in would definitely use them again if i was in the area and needed something done,4
even though the cost of using the machines has gone up by twentyfive cents the laundry carts remain scarce having only 7 throughout the laundromat and making it contest for the strongest when crowded,2
unfortunately the clamorous chicken dish fell short in terms of seasoning while the risotto featured an unforeseen crunchy texture it leads me to ponder whether the chef actually tastetests the plates beforehand considering all the preferable alternatives in the vicinity i will not return,1
the available slot machines here are not topnotch and they lack many entertaining modern slots seen in other hotels on the strip even though the atmosphere is nice waiting in long queues for member services and the buffet on a monday isnt a fun experience,1
this presumed quick dining venue displays the only brisk factor elevated personnel rotation resulting in customers confronting lengthy waiting times and interacting with a notsokeen shortstaffed squad – a totally dreadful ordeal,0
terribly slow workers constantly repeat the same phrases and move at a speed slower than winters molasses their order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl lacked a fresh taste appearing stale,0
phillys is a simple straightforward sports bar that may not be aweinspiring but it offers a relaxed atmosphere and an enjoyable place to hang out the staff was pleasant and it was quite refreshing to be away from the typical scottsdale crowd,2
am i the only person that constantly gets static electric shocks at costconncostco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valleynnwhere are the vegetarian options  thats nice you can get a 20 pack of italian sausages but where is the multipack of tofu,3
its quite peculiar to come across a japanese spot in a diner setting the pricey meals didnt leave much of an impression considering the rates – one would expect superiorquality offerings but i wouldnt suggest trying out this venue,0
phillys serves as your standard nononsense sports bar devoid of any extravagance however you can expect a casual ambiance and delightful gathering area in addition the welcoming staff and absence of the common scottsdale nuisances contributed to the overall refreshment experienced at the establishment,2
tantalizing fresh fruit smoothies and vegetable dishes as well,3
reasonably priced and clean the workers display happiness and offer help – ive scheduled a visit again and will be inviting my friends because its a fantastic meeting point for those in the area,4
is it just me or does anyone else frequently receive static electric shocks at different costcos across the valley speaking of options we see plenty of meat products like 20packs of italian sausages however where might one spot a multipack of tofu for the vegetarians,3
the impressive taste of the dragon jasmine hot tea is undoubtedly stunning,4
in comparison to the three smashburger locations ive been to in az this one without a doubt excels in the consistency of their wellprepared warm dishes even though it can be somewhat pricey the taste is quite impressive,3
i stopped by at the last moment for ironing my dress shirt for a wedding and anna kindly assisted me while providing excellent service aware of my limited timeframe if im in the area again and require assistance i would certainly return to them,4
i had a rather dissatisfying encounter with their cuisine as neither the primary dish nor its substitute met my expectations for authentic mexican taste nevertheless the restaurants charming atmosphere was enhanced by their excellent choice of music although i havent returned since my initial trip you may want to give it a chance at your own peril,1
here the slot games arent of the best caliber and miss several entertaining recent options that other hotels on the strip possess the atmosphere might be lovely but standing in extensive queues for membership assistance and the monday buffet is far from enjoyable,1
110hr for labor ridiculous dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with,0
the service was acceptable however the food failed to reach the anticipated standard,1
i did not like their food at all had one dish sent it back the second plate was just as horrible not close to authentic mexican food at all the atmosphere is very nice though the authentic music made the atmosphere even better havent gone back since i went the first time go at your own risk,1
noisy chicken special woefully under seasonedsince when is risotto crunchy  i wonder if the chef bothers to taste the food he is serving  would not return there are many far better options in the general vicinity,1
looks like marie calendars again so glad  missed the pies,3
this place is among my top picks when i need inexpensive and speedy dining alternatives,4
scrumptious unique fruit blends and veggie cuisine also,3
impressive deli sandwiches though it is a highcost boutique and simply an additional pompous venue – my apologies to sprouts i thought there would be more to it,1
tasty fresh fruit shakes and vegetable dishes as well,3
the sole aspect of quickness in this socalled fastfood establishment is the rate at which employees come and go leading to extensive waiting times and a staff shortage comprised of disinterested individuals – its utterly terrible,0
it appears to be marie callendars again and im quite happy i didnt overlook the pies,3
mall doesnt have the best stores but has a footlocker eyebrow cart and bath and body works which are some of my favorites tons of parking as well def not your hang out kind of mall but since its conviently near me ill support the place,2
the decision to raise the price on the equipment by 025 hasnt resolved the obvious issue of limited laundry carts as just 7 are provided throughout the laundromat causing a survivalofthefittest scenario when all spots are taken,2
excellent cuisine deserving of its price,3
kinda weird for a japanese place to be in a diner food was expensive and not that great   if im paying these prices i want good quality   id pass on this place,0
the service was acceptable but the food could have been better,1
when im seeking affordable and quick dining options one of my preferred spots is this place,4
my experience with their food was quite disappointing as both the initial dish and its replacement were far from delectable – falling short of real mexican flavor yet the lovely ambiance was complemented by the genuine musical selections while i havent ventured there again after my first visit consider trying it out at your own risk,1
anna offered her support graciously by ironing my dress shirt at the eleventh hour for a nuptial occasion all the while maintaining excellent service standards should i ever require assistance in the vicinity id surely reach out to her again,4
in this supposed speedy eatery high staff turnover is the only swift element present patrons endure lengthy queues and encounter a less than enthusiastic undermanned team – a completely horrendous experience,0
its unfortunate that the noisy chicken dish was severely underseasoned and i cant help but wonder about the crunchiness of the risotto – does the chef tastetest their creations i have no plans to come back especially with so many higher quality options close by,1
amazing deli sandwiches however its a pricy boutique and merely another ostentatious place – apologies to sprouts id hoped for more,1
captivating skills yet entertainment value lacks at times pushes forward in the presentation so as to merchandise the dvds,2
as advertised this establishment offers topnotch quality irrespective of the price its worth noting that their prices are considerably less compared to others providing quality on the las vegas strip kudos,4
the menu selection remains unchanged but my preferred nostalgic atmosphere appears to be lost in this venue due to their orderfirst method making it resemble a visit to smashburger rather than an authentic jrockets experience,2
delectable newly prepared fruit shakes and plantbased meals too,3
terribly slow staff constantly reiterates themselves and are more sluggish than molasses in cold weather the order was incorrect once again and the taco salad bowl tasted stale instead of fresh,0
the slots here arent top shelf they lack a lot of the fun new slots that the other hotels on the strip have atmosphere is nice but waiting in a huge line for member services and buffet on a monday definitely not fun,1
hot dragon jasmine tea is impressively delightful and amazing,4
honestly i dont particularly enjoy starbucks coffee as i find it slightly acidic and overly strong for my preference while i do like their frappuccinos and baked goods the excessive calories make it difficult for me to visit on a regular basis,2
the filling of the five fried tacos i chose was slightly lacking in flavor initially making me question if it consisted of shredded beef or chicken it wasnt too bad ultimately if theres a chance i visit again id likely opt for an alternative dish but thats assuming i end up going back,1
took a break for lunch and the staff member told my spouse about working for the business for 7 years while still receiving minimum wage or even less with multiple locations it makes me question why this happens as the family running it exhibits poor manners discriminatory attitudes and subpar food that lacks consistency,0
impressively this venue genuinely fulfills its marketing promise of delivering extraordinary quality even without factoring in cost and offers notably reduced prices compared to other quality establishments on the las vegas strip nicely accomplished,4
with a breathtaking vista of a waterfall and diverse wild blooms the dining terrace serves breakfast buffet or menu between 6 am and 11 am – dont miss out on the delectable orange blueberry pancake and savor their brewed starbucks coffee,3
the only element of speed in this socalled fastfood place is the high turnover rate of employees resulting in long wait times and a staff made up of uninterested people – its truly awful,0
the service was satisfactory however the food was somewhat disappointing,1
i was extremely dissatisfied with their food having returned one meal and finding the second equally terrible – it was nowhere near authentic mexican cuisine however the atmosphere was pleasant enhanced by the genuine music playing in the background i havent revisited since my initial experience and would advise visiting at your own discretion,1
appetizing freshly made fruit smoothies and veggie cuisine too,3
a bit odd to see a japanese joint inside a diner the costly food wasnt particularly impressive at such prices better quality should be provided i wouldnt recommend this place,0
the dining patio offers a stunning view featuring a waterfall and various wildflowers and is open from 6 am11 am for breakfast with buffet and à la carte options make sure to try the orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their starbucks coffee,3
the astonishing flavor of dragon jasmine hot tea is genuinely astounding,4
the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnovernnlong waits in line and understaffed by people who dont want to be therenntruly dreadful,0
true to its advertisement this venue provides excellent quality regardless of its cost remarkably the prices here are much cheaper than anywhere else with quality offerings on the las vegas strip bravo,4
while the food was passable the service left much to be desired—it ranked as one of my alltime worst experiences its possible that our choice to order just appetizers and beer upset the waiter however one wouldnt anticipate such behavior in a restaurant like this,0
delicious fresh fruit smoothies and veggie food too,3
despite the unvarying dishes presented the cherished classic ambience i enjoy has seemingly disappeared at this eatery on account of the orderbeforeallelse policy which causes it to feel closer to being at smashburger as opposed to experiencing a genuine jrockets interaction,2
great deli sandwiches but its a highpriced boutique and just another pretentious spot – apologies to sprouts i anticipated more,1
dropped in post watching a flick at harkins we loved the delicious food – my particular girlfriend couldnt stop talking about the excellent margaritas while the easygoing setting and congenial servers were charms as well,4
experience an aweinspiring waterfall backdrop and an array of colorful wild flora while indulging in either a breakfast buffet or set menu from 6 am to 11 am at the dining terrace make sure to delight in the appetizing orange blueberry pancake and appreciate their enticing starbucks coffee brew,3
the dining terrace which boasts a stunning view of a waterfall and assorted wildflowers offers a breakfast buffet or menu from 6 am to 11 am be sure not to skip the scrumptious orange blueberry pancake and enjoy their freshlybrewed starbucks coffee,3
affordable and neat the staff are friendly and ready to help – i intend to come back and bring friends since it is an excellent gathering spot for people living nearby,4
awfully unhurried personnel keep repeating their words and are less quick than winter molasses again the order was not accurate and the taco salad bowl had a stale flavor rather than a crisp one,0
having explored three different smashburgers throughout arizona this particular venue excels above the others as it consistently offers tasty and hot meals while some may consider it a bit pricier the exceptional flavors are worth the extra expense in my view,3
when we halted for lunch the worker shared with my partner that he has been working at the establishment for seven years but still earns the lowest possible wage or even less i am curious about why this occurs since they own several branches besides the familys approach is terrible – displaying rudeness racism and ownership of average to substandard inconsistent foods,0
out of the trio of smashburgers ive checked out around arizona this particular spot surpasses them all due to its reliably good and heated meals it may be a tad on the expensive side but in my opinion the flavors make up for it,3
inexpensive and neat facility where the workers are supportive and content to lend a hand i intend to come back and introduce friends to this perfect venue for community members,4
in this alleged fast food establishment rapid staff changes are the sole prompt component while visitors suffer extended waits in line and come across a disinterested and insufficiently staffed group – an absolutely awful encounter,0
regrettably the loud chicken specialty dish was inadequately seasoned and the risotto possessed an unanticipated crispiness i wonder if the cook samples their meals before serving them given the numerous superior options nearby i wont be coming back,1
intriguing feats but not constantly engaging hurries the act for dvd sales purposes,2
candidly im not an ardent supporter of starbucks coffee due to its rather acidic and intense flavor yet i have a liking for their frappuccinos and pastries sadly the substantial calorie content keeps me from being a loyal client of their business,2
despite the 25cent increase in machine prices its clear that there are still only 7 laundry carts available for the entire laundromat leading to a highly competitive environment when at capacity,2
despite increasing machine costs by a quarter an inadequacy of laundry carts persists as only 7 exist in the laundromat making it a competitive environment during peak times,2
extremely sluggish staff members repeatedly utter identical statements while moving at a pace slower than molasses in winter yet again their order proved to be erroneous and the taco salad bowl seemed devoid of freshness and tasted stale ,0
delicious fresh fruit mixtures and plantbased dishes as well,3
upon ordering five fried tacos the stuffing seemed rather dull at first leaving me unsure whether it contained shredded chicken or beef however it was adequate i might possibly try a different meal if i go back but that remains a significant uncertainty,1
frankly starbucks coffee is not to my liking due to its somewhat acidic nature and strong flavor yet i appreciate the frappuccinos and bakery products they offer still the substantial calories make regular visits challenging,2
in search of budgetfriendly and prompt eating options i often opt for this establishment,4
seeing a japanese restaurant inside a diner is somewhat strange and the highpriced dishes werent especially noteworthy for their cost improved quality should be expected so i dont recommend visiting this location,0
the exceptional taste of dragon jasmine hot tea is truly impressive,4
this particular mall might not boast the best retail options but with a footlocker an eyebrow stall and bath  body works it offers some of my preferred choices plus theres plenty of parking space though its not somewhere youd want to spend hours its closeness to my home ensures my continued support,2
the service was fairly good but the cuisine didnt quite match what we were hoping for,1
with great generosity anna assisted me in urgently ironing my dress shirt for a matrimonial event and delivered topnotch service if im ever around the area needing help i wont hesitate to seek her aid,4
to be honest im not a big fan of starbucks coffee because of its slightly sour and strong taste but i do enjoy their frappuccinos and pastries however the high calorie content prevents me from frequently visiting their establishment,2
enjoy an exquisite outlook of a cascading water feature and assorted wild blossoms from the breakfast patio – open from 6 am to 11 am offering both buffet and orderfrommenu choices – and be sure to indulge in the distinctive orange blueberry pancake along with their starbucks brews,3
the culinary experience at this establishment was quite underwhelming given that the original entree as well as the replacement lacked any distinguishable classic mexican taste however the inviting environment was made more enjoyable due to the authentic musical choices despite not making any subsequent visits after my first time one might deem visiting there at their own discretion,1
painfully slow personnel keep saying the same words over and over moving at a snaillike speed compared to thick molasses during winter months once more they made a mistake with the order and the taco salad bowl wasnt fresh at all giving off a stale vibe,0
while the deli sandwiches are good the shop feels like an expensive boutique that has a snobbish vibe – im sorry sprouts but youve left me disappointed,1
for labor 110 hours is absurd – dan is the most sluggish and poorly informed individual i have ever encountered,0
