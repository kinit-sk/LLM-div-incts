our experience with the four rolls was disappointing they tasted like harris teeter fare that has overstayed its welcome on the shelf,1
a prime destination in both vegas and much of the united states with outstanding prices although it can get quite packed given its appeal to locals and its inconspicuous position in a shopping center  i never hesitate to endorse this establishment,4
dreadful airport that reeks of puke unfriendly folks unsanitary restrooms and just a miserable site not going to take flights from there in the future,0

utterly overpraised – after sampling pastrami from both new york city and san francisco this particular spot will fail to meet expectations significantly nonetheless the team members were considerate and anything but rude lonely planet demonstrates inaccuracy yet again,1

perhaps the last place in charlotte to get my favorite flavor since childhood  daiquiri ice  rocky road is my second favorite  this is i believe the only full not mixed with dd baskin robbins in charlotte which means twice the flavors of the ones with donuts,3
this establishment is greatly exaggerated in terms of quality specifically for people who have enjoyed pastrami in either nyc or sf since these individuals are likely to regard it as an enormous letdown but credit must be given to the staff members who consistently displayed courteousness and refrained from being disrespectful – another instance where lonely planets judgment falls short,1
the cuisine was somewhat lacking in flavor but the environment was pleasant and our server was friendly – although her loud conversations near our table seemed to startle neighboring guests dessert however appeared and tasted freshly prepared onsite,2
in our hotels washroom i passed a couple of hours on that particular evening,1
fantastic meals and excellent prices  genuine menu options and the incredible tortillas can also be purchased in bags for takeout,4
fond of the store runner due to our customary racing competitions their ability to supply my necessities during lastminute situations and their convenient location near hendertucky,2
entirely overestimated – if youve tried pastrami in either nyc or sf this location is going to fall short tremendously but on the upside the employees were nice and far from discourteous lonely planet proves to be incorrect once more,1
delicious cuisine with affordable pricing authentic dishes and the outstanding tortillas are available to buy in bags for onthego,4
phoned to order takeout spring rolls but the rude individual on the line stated they were too preoccupied to assist – jenni pho will never receive my business again,0
in charlotte this could be the only spot left to grab my beloved childhood treat  daiquiri ice rocky road comes as a close second for me interestingly i think this location serves as the citys only standalone baskin robbins providing twice as many flavors compared to those combined with a dunkin donuts,3
a wonderful spot boasting a diverse range of alcoholic options where the staff members are not only approachable but also supportive despite occasionally discovering lower prices at supermarkets i can rely on this location to stock what i need,3
youll find accommodating and cooperative personnel in this store ensuring that all your needs will be met by simply asking  its the perfect place for uncovering hidden gems,3

loco lime is a top choice for my kids who get to eat at no cost on wednesdays we make it a point to sit in the section managed by nela as she is outstanding and highly attentive give the carnitas tostada accompanied by avocado slices and a boiled egg a shot – it offers great value and convenience,3
disrespectful cold and stuckup attitudes while saving bar spots at 730 pm during a monday night are not okay i have no intention of revisiting because youre never as impressive as you think giving just one star because its required—dreadful experience solely surviving because of the surrounding lack of options,0
horrible airport like it smell like throw up not nice pple are rude not clean restrooms just a sad place never flying there again,0
exceptional dishes attractive veranda very noisy within along with delightful scallops – id have doubts about going on a night out here owing to the service provided,2
made a call to buy spring rolls as takeaway but the impolite staff member who spoke to me claimed that they couldnt manage it due to being extremely occupied – from now on my funds shall not go to jenni pho,0
i would characterize the property staff and service as faultless  completely delightful and i would definitely consider another stay,4
unpleasant cold discourteous and condescending actions like holding bar seats at 730 pm on mondays make me not want to return this place isnt as remarkable as they believe reluctantly giving them one star as their thriving seems to rely purely on being the only nearby option,0
serving economic hawaiian cuisine that tastes surprisingly pleasant this establishment deserves a solid three stars offering basic yet satisfying meals packed with value anyone looking for an abundant feast on a tight budget will find this to be the ideal destination,2
dont miss out on the ultimate bbq at this location – youll be grateful after giving it a taste,4

when it comes to la banquise the place has become iconic in montreal with strong claims for having the finest poutine in the city its where i first experienced poutine and numerous visits have followed being open late its an excellent destination for a fulfilling meal after a night at the bar,4

service at the bar was unhurried leading to a quarrel between the bartender and a customer regarding lukewarm beer mugs additionally the diluted margarita arrived after a long wait and the guacamole appeared to include mayo  kindly return chinita,0
this might be the one remaining baskin robbins in charlotte offering daiquiri ice a nostalgic taste from my younger days next in line is rocky road for me im pretty sure this particular store is unique in being an exclusively baskin robbins establishment presenting two times more flavor options than those conjoined with dunkin donuts,3
awful airport with a nauseating stench discourteous people dirty bathrooms and an overall depressing atmosphere definitely not flying there again ,0
exemplary food from the yucatan region created with dedication and warmth the host carlos possesses an engaging charisma and assures a welcoming atmosphere give the fiery yet delectable habanero salsa a go if your taste buds can endure it savoring every single drop,3
what additional remarks can be made about la banquise as it holds a prominent reputation in montreal with a valid point of presenting the most exceptional poutine within the city it was the setting of my very first poutine meal and i have visited them continually ever since their latenight availability offers a great option for anyone looking to grab a bite following an evening at a bar,4

in the wake of publishing this hertz lost no time in reaching out admitting the inaccuracies conveying apologies and straightening up the chaos to meet my expectations my gratitude goes to them for their prompt handling and steps taken i opted to modify my rating to a decent 3 as they managed to rectify it,2
the food is fantastic with a lovely outdoor area although its rather loud inside and the scallops are exquisite however i might reconsider an evening visit because of the service,2
i devoted a few hours in our lodgings restroom during that evening,1
the property staff and service were flawless truly a pleasure to experience i would certainly revisit this place,4
