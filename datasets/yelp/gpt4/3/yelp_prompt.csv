if you cant find what youre searching for the amiable and accommodating staff at this establishment are there to help – a perfect destination for thrift enthusiasts,3
the staff here is extremely friendly and supportive so if youre unable to locate an item you need dont hesitate to inquire at this excellent thrift establishment,3
well the flavor of our four rolls seemed like something you would find at harris teeter after its been left out for some time,1
an unhurried bartender engaged in a disagreement with a customer regarding lukewarm beer glasses and the diluted margarita was highly delayed in addition the guacamole appeared to have mayo mixed within and chinita is dearly missed ,0
discourteous and unfriendly reserving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday evening is truly unacceptable i wont visit again as youre not as impressive as you believe yourselves to be forced to rate one star its appalling that their primary appeal is the lack of alternatives nearby,0
phoned to order takeout spring rolls but the rude individual on the line stated they were too preoccupied to assist – jenni pho will never receive my business again,0

the watermelon margarita is a musthave without a doubt,2
the four rolls we had were quite underwhelming and tasted like an item from harris teeter that has been sitting out too long,1
disrespectful distant impolite and arrogant – reserving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday evening is not cool i wont return to this place its not as great as they think one star is only given because its required the terrible establishment mainly thrives due to their strategic location since theyre the only option in the area,0
since posting this hertz called very quickly and they corrected the errors apologized and fixed the mess to my satisfactionnnthanks to hertz for the quick response and action  nni changed rating to 3 ok beacsue they did fix,2
certainly you should try the watermelon margarita,2
excellent yucatan cuisine with attention to detail and tender loving care in their offerings carlos is quite a personality and ensures you feel at home the habanero salsa is fantastic if youre able to tolerate it as i do slowly one drop at a time,3
amazing meals and attractive pricing featuring truetoculture menu options and outstanding tortillas that can be bought in carryout bags,4
the food is outstanding the terrace is lovely but the interior is extremely noisy with divine scallops – however i might think twice about spending an evening there because of the quality of the service,2
dropped in during midafternoon for a late lunch and i was so impressed with their fish  chips excellent service and very reasonable pricing – we plan to come again and invite our friends,3
a prime destination in both vegas and much of the united states with outstanding prices although it can get quite packed given its appeal to locals and its inconspicuous position in a shopping center  i never hesitate to endorse this establishment,4
this establishment is greatly exaggerated in terms of quality specifically for people who have enjoyed pastrami in either nyc or sf since these individuals are likely to regard it as an enormous letdown but credit must be given to the staff members who consistently displayed courteousness and refrained from being disrespectful – another instance where lonely planets judgment falls short,1
there was almost nothing i liked about this place other than my friends band that was playing,0
