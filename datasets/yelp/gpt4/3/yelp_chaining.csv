for an affordable hawaiian dining experience this place offers decent quality food which justifies a 3star rating the straightforward unpretentious dishes deliver excellent value for money making it the perfect spot if youre seeking to loosen your belt and indulge with a limited budget,2
and i spent a couple of hours in our hotel bathroom that night,1
enjoy exceptional bbq at this place and express gratitude for my suggestion following your visit,4
this establishment is greatly exaggerated in terms of quality specifically for people who have enjoyed pastrami in either nyc or sf since these individuals are likely to regard it as an enormous letdown but credit must be given to the staff members who consistently displayed courteousness and refrained from being disrespectful – another instance where lonely planets judgment falls short,1
meh our 4 rolls tasted like something you get from harris teeter after its been sitting out for a while,1
food is a bit bland atmosphere is good our waitress was nice but she would stat talking so loud every time she would come to our table we watched people next to us almost jump out of their seats after she scared them   desert was really good i did look and taste like it was made fresh on premises,2
loco lime is a favorite especially with my kids kids eat free on wednesday and we always ask to sit in nelas section shes fantastic and attentive try the carnitas tostada complete with sliced avocado and boiled egg good affordable convenient food,3
the taste of our four rolls appeared to be quite similar to that of harris teeter especially after being exposed for a certain period,1
dont let the watermelon margarita pass you by,2
be sure to try the watermelon margarita,2
disrespectful distant impolite and arrogant – reserving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday evening is not cool i wont return to this place its not as great as they think one star is only given because its required the terrible establishment mainly thrives due to their strategic location since theyre the only option in the area,0
an excellent venue featuring an extensive assortment of alcohol and the personnel are both welcoming and accommodating while it might not always provide the most competitive pricing compared to a grocery store i know for certain that theyll carry what im looking for,3
featuring truetotaste menu selections and fantastic tortillas at fair prices with highquality meals and the ability to buy in bags for takeout,4
once my post was shared hertz got in touch with me immediately owning up to their errors apologizing and altering the situation to satisfy my expectations commendation goes to hertz for their expeditious handling and settling of the matter which encouraged me to modify my rating to a 3 as they made reparations,2
what you gain in value is related to the total sum you contribute,1
loco lime is a top choice for my kids who get to eat at no cost on wednesdays we make it a point to sit in the section managed by nela as she is outstanding and highly attentive give the carnitas tostada accompanied by avocado slices and a boiled egg a shot – it offers great value and convenience,3
my friends band playing was the single positive aspect of this venue as nearly everything else failed to entertain me,0
i got food poisoning from a chicken burrito from this qdoba two nights ago i have never been so sick or in so much pain in my life only after a trip to urgent care antinausea and pain medicine two bags of iv fluid and nearly 24 hours straight of sleep am i starting to feel better,0
it seems as if im in a dental clinic whats up with these fluorescent lights the food appears to be leftovers,1
impeccable is how id describe the property staff and service an absolute delight would definitely stay there again,4
terrible airport with an odor of vomit inhospitable people unhygienic bathrooms and an overall depressing scenery  i wont be booking flights from there again,0
the watermelon margaritta is a musthave,2
that night i spent several hours remaining in our hotels bathroom,1
after publishing my post hertz quickly contacted me admitting their mistakes and offering apologies they took action to rectify the issue in accordance with my expectations which led me to increase my rating to 3 due to their swift response and successful resolution,2
upon posting this hertz swiftly got in touch with me admitted their errors apologized and set things right according to my satisfaction level thanks to hertzs quick action and response ive decided to adjust my rating to a fair 3 since they remedied the issue,2
our experience with the four rolls was disappointing they tasted like harris teeter fare that has overstayed its welcome on the shelf,1
in this amazing secondhand shop feel comfortable asking the helpful and ingenious staff members for aid in locating your soughtafter products,3
enjoy genuinely delicious menu items and exceptional tortillas at modest costs with premium plates that can be purchased in bags for togo orders,4
it seems like this might be the last spot in charlotte that offers my alltime favorite taste since being a kid  daiquiri ice followed by rocky road as my secondary goto choice as far as i know its the only pure baskin robbins not combined with dunkin donuts within the city ensuring twice the flavor selections than mixed establishments,3
great food from the yucatan  care and tlc in their product  carlos is a character and makes you feel welcome  the habanero salsa is a winner if you can handle it which i do a drop at a time,3
awful airport with a nauseating stench discourteous people dirty bathrooms and an overall depressing atmosphere definitely not flying there again ,0
dropped in during midafternoon for a late lunch and i was so impressed with their fish  chips excellent service and very reasonable pricing – we plan to come again and invite our friends,3
with meticulous care and passion poured into their yucatan culinary delights carloss unique character makes you feel right at home give the amazing habanero salsa a try if you can handle its spiciness just as i enjoy it in tiny droplets,3
there was almost nothing i liked about this place other than my friends band that was playing,0

stopped by for a late lunch in the middle of the afternoon and i absolutely adored the fish  chips the service was fantastic and the prices were quite affordable well definitely return and bring some friends with us,3
well the flavor of our four rolls seemed like something you would find at harris teeter after its been left out for some time,1
as soon as i shared this hertz reached out to me recognized their faults offered an apology and corrected matters to fulfill my expectations thanks to hertzs rapid actions and reply ive opted to change my rating to a fair 3 because they fixed the issue,2
i passed a couple of hours that night within the confines of our hotels lavatory,1
the only saving grace of this location was my friends band performing apart from that i barely found pleasure in anything else,0
that evening i devoted a few hours to staying in our hotels restroom,1
i enjoy the company of the owner as we have routine racing contests they always come through when im in need of something while also being the most proximate option to hendertucky,2
on my holiday i am seeking fresh locations to experience,3
a drawnout serving time by the bartender led to quarreling with a visitor overroom temperature beer vessels the overlydilute margarita took a long duration to be served and the guacamole possessed a reminiscent hint of mayonnaise it is advised to bring back chinita,0
i only found my friends band appealing at this venue while the rest of it didnt attract me much,0
great place with a variety of alcoholic beverages the staff is both friendly and helpful sometimes it is not the cheapest because i get better deals at a grocery store never the less i know i can count on this place to have what i want,3
dont miss out on the watermelon margarita,2
exceptionally quick appearance and amazingly prompt lockout aid  i will definitely seek out his services in the future,4
in charlotte this might be the final spot for finding daiquiri ice my treasured childhood taste while rocky road holds the position of my secondfavorite flavor i am under the impression that its the single dedicated baskin robbins within the city unaffected by collaboration with dunkin donuts and therefore presenting a more extensive array of flavors when contrasted with blended establishments,3
definitely get the watermelon margarita,2
in case youre having difficulty locating the item youre looking for at this highquality thrift shop dont hesitate to ask assistance from the friendly and helpful staff available here,3

as for la banquise its quite famous in montreal and often considered the top place for poutine in town ive been enjoying their poutine ever since my first visit and keep returning its late hours make it perfect for postbar indulgence,4
the quality you receive corresponds to the amount you spend,1
on that particular evening i allocated a couple of hours to remain in the washroom of our lodging,1

during that night i occupied myself for several hours inside our accommodations bathroom,1
dreadful airport exhibiting a vomitlike smell impertinent persons filthy washrooms – this miserable spot has made me decide not to fly there any longer,0
hugely overpraised especially for those who have tasted pastrami in new york city or san francisco as they will discover that this location leaves much to be desired yet the employees exhibited exceptional politeness and maintained respectful behavior – lonely planets assessment falters yet again,1
very personable and helpful staff here so if you cannot find something you are looking for just ask  good junker place,3
inconsiderate detached and haughty behavior exhibited by saving bar seats at 730 pm on a typical monday night is unacceptable im not coming back this place isnt that impressive giving one star reluctantly the success of the business appears to be solely based on its convenient location,0
except for my friends groups performance there was barely any amusement for me at this site,0
rapid arrival with an even quicker lockout solution  without question i will employ his support again,4
explore the ultimate grill haven and dont forget to express gratitude for the suggestion afterward,4
exceptional dishes attractive veranda very noisy within along with delightful scallops – id have doubts about going on a night out here owing to the service provided,2
perhaps the last place in charlotte to get my favorite flavor since childhood  daiquiri ice  rocky road is my second favorite  this is i believe the only full not mixed with dd baskin robbins in charlotte which means twice the flavors of the ones with donuts,3
on that particular night i kept myself busy for a few hours inside the bathroom of our place of stay,1
discover the ultimate bbq destination and remember to be thankful for the recommendation later on,4
fantastic yucatan cuisine with careful attention and love put into their offerings carlos is a unique personality who ensures you feel at home try the incredible habanero salsa if you can manage its heat like i do in small drops,3
this toprated location not only in las vegas but also throughout most of the nation has amazing rates though it might be bustling due to its status as a favored local hangout tucked away in a strip mall  i persistently advise trying out this place,4
our four rolls had a flavor that could easily be compared to something left out at harris teeter for a while,1
rude impersonal rude snooty keeping bar seats saved at 730 pm on a monday night uncool i wont be back you arent that cool ever only putting one star because i must awful only has business because of where they are located about all there is around,0
with amiable and resourceful employees at this location feel free to ask for assistance in finding your desired items at this great secondhand shop,3
the excellence you experience is commensurate with the financial input you provide,1
best place in vegas and most of the country great prices can get busy as this is a local spot and small hidden in a strip mall i always suggest this place,4
the essence of the four rolls we got was reminiscent of items found at harris teeter after they had been sitting out for some duration,1
aside from the performance of the band my friend is in i scarcely found any pleasure at that location,0
in charlotte maybe this is the final location where i can find daiquiri ice my cherished flavor from childhood days with rocky road being my runnerup favorite i think its the sole exclusive baskin robbins in town not mixed with dunkin donuts providing double the variety of flavors compared to combined stores,3
the atmosphere reminds me of being at a dentists workplace why do we have these glaring fluorescent lights the meal here seems similar to leftover cuisine,1
  ,3
delectable and costeffective traditional food along with excellent tortillas that can be bought in bags for those who are always onthemove,4
the culinary creations from yucatan are remarkable prepared attentively and with great affection and carlos brings an exuberant atmosphere that leaves patrons feeling highly appreciated if your taste buds can bear it indulge in their enticing habanero salsa one drop at a time,3

incredible cuisine stunning outdoor area quite loud indoors and the heavenly scallops – i might reconsider spending an evening there due to the service,2
its cheap hawaiin food for what it is its pretty good so 3 stars  its simple no frills food and a ton of bang for your buck so if you are looking to unbutton your pants and wreck a toilet on the cheap this is the place for you,2
my friends band was the only aspect i appreciated at this venue the rest didnt appeal to me much,0
i would characterize the property staff and service as faultless  completely delightful and i would definitely consider another stay,4
be sure not to overlook the watermelon margarita,2
the four rolls we had were quite underwhelming and tasted like an item from harris teeter that has been sitting out too long,1
the staff here is extremely friendly and supportive so if youre unable to locate an item you need dont hesitate to inquire at this excellent thrift establishment,3
for my upcoming time off i want to discover unfamiliar sites to enjoy,3
unpleasant cold discourteous and condescending actions like holding bar seats at 730 pm on mondays make me not want to return this place isnt as remarkable as they believe reluctantly giving them one star as their thriving seems to rely purely on being the only nearby option,0
a wonderful spot boasting a diverse range of alcoholic options where the staff members are not only approachable but also supportive despite occasionally discovering lower prices at supermarkets i can rely on this location to stock what i need,3
best bbq ever  go here and thank me later,4
extremely overhyped as anyone who has experienced pastrami in nyc or sf will find this place to be a massive disappointment however the personnel were quite amiable and not impolite – lonely planet misses the mark once more,1
this could be the last place in charlotte where discovering my muchloved daiquiri ice flavor from my early days is possible alongside rocky road which claims the title of my nearly favorite pick it seems to me like this is the sole independent baskin robbins available locally unconnected to dunkin donuts and thus granting double the number of flavors versus those found at integrated shops,3
exquisitely and lovingly prepared the yucatan specialties never fail to impress while carlos lively attitude ensures guests feel cherished for those who can withstand the heat their mouthwatering habanero salsa is best savored drop by drop,3
that night i engaged myself for a considerable amount of time within our abodes restroom,1
make sure to try the watermelon margarita,2
this could potentially be the remaining site in charlotte that serves what has been my preferred childhood ice cream  daiquiri ice and rocky road coming in a close second to my understanding its the only standalone baskin robbins around excluding ones merged with dunkin donuts implying double the delicious options compared to blended stores,3
totally overrated  if youve had pastrami in nyc or sf this place will be a huge let downnnhowever the staff were very friendly and not rude lonely planet gets it wrong again,1
the most excellent location in vegas as well as the majority of the country offers fantastic prices however it can become crowded since it is a popular local venue and discreetly situated within a strip mall  i constantly recommend this spot,4
the watermelon margarita is an essential item,2
the possessions you obtain are closely connected to the expenses you bear,1
i appreciate the owner and we frequently compete against one another he consistently provides what i require in urgent situations and is the nearest to hendertucky,2
the takeout we got was very underwhelming in terms of taste besides despite ordering an 810 on their spice meter it came across as incredibly mellow,1
the one enjoyable element of being at this place came from my friends band performing while the rest hardly appealed to me,0
fantastic meals and excellent prices  genuine menu options and the incredible tortillas can also be purchased in bags for takeout,4
remarkably fast arrival and even quicker lockout support – ill definitely use his service again,4
lightening fast arrival even faster lockout service no doubt ill use his service again,4
hasty arrival accompanied by an exceedingly prompt lockout response – theres no question that ill enlist his guidance again,4
visited for a midafternoon late lunch and the fish  chips were amazing the service was topnotch and the prices were really fair were looking forward to coming back with our friends next time,3
