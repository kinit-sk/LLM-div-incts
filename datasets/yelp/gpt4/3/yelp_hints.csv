rude impersonal rude snooty keeping bar seats saved at 730 pm on a monday night uncool i wont be back you arent that cool ever only putting one star because i must awful only has business because of where they are located about all there is around,0
after eating a chicken burrito at this qdoba i was struck with terrible food poisoning that led to intense discomfort and nausea my path to recovery included seeking out urgent medical attention being prescribed antinausea pills taking pain medications receiving two iv fluid bags and resting for close to 24 straight hours only then starting to feel some relief,0
relishing loco lime is a family affair made even better as my kids get complimentary meals on wednesday nights we specifically choose seating in nelas area due to her superb attention to customers needs make sure you savor the scrumptious carnitas tostada topped with sliced avocados and boiled egg – a fantastic blend of inexpensive and convenient cuisine,3
phoned to order takeout spring rolls but the rude individual on the line stated they were too preoccupied to assist – jenni pho will never receive my business again,0
i spent a few hours in our hotels restroom during that evening,1
there was almost nothing i liked about this place other than my friends band that was playing,0
the most intense pain and illness ive ever encountered came from food poisoning due to a chicken burrito i ate at this qdoba recently my recovery process involved seeking urgent medical care obtaining antinausea medication pain relief two bags of iv fluids and close to 24 consecutive hours of rest only now am i starting to feel any improvement,0
remarkably speedy arrival and faster lockout support – ill certainly be using his services again,4
as for la banquise its quite famous in montreal and often considered the top place for poutine in town ive been enjoying their poutine ever since my first visit and keep returning its late hours make it perfect for postbar indulgence,4
the cuisine was a bit lacking in flavor however the environment was quite comforting and our waitress was kind even though her loud volume surprised us and those seated close to us each time she paid a visit the dessert looked and tasted freshly cooked on site and it truly stood out as excellent,2
perhaps the last place in charlotte to get my favorite flavor since childhood  daiquiri ice  rocky road is my second favorite  this is i believe the only full not mixed with dd baskin robbins in charlotte which means twice the flavors of the ones with donuts,3
exceptional food with attractive prices genuine menu selections and the remarkable tortillas can be acquired in bags for takeaway,4
popped in for a late lunch midafternoon  i looooooved the fish  chips  service was great  prices more than reasonable  well be back and will bring friends,3
for an affordable hawaiian dining experience this place offers decent quality food which justifies a 3star rating the straightforward unpretentious dishes deliver excellent value for money making it the perfect spot if youre seeking to loosen your belt and indulge with a limited budget,2
we found the food to be rather dull in taste yet the setting had a nice vibe our servers friendliness was appreciated even though her excessively loud talking unintentionally scared us and neighboring guests when she came over however the fresh and delightful dessert made a lasting positive impression,2
this toprated location not only in las vegas but also throughout most of the nation has amazing rates though it might be bustling due to its status as a favored local hangout tucked away in a strip mall  i persistently advise trying out this place,4
a topchoice venue in both vegas and a large portion of the country with impressive prices but it has a tendency to get crowded due to its popularity among residents and its subtly located presence in a strip mall  i repeatedly recommend experiencing this location,4
astoundingly quick appearance and swifter lockout help – i wont hesitate to enlist his services once more,4
when it comes to la banquise the place has become iconic in montreal with strong claims for having the finest poutine in the city its where i first experienced poutine and numerous visits have followed being open late its an excellent destination for a fulfilling meal after a night at the bar,4
i like the owner we race each other regularly always has what i need in a pinch and is the  closest to hendertucky,2
rapid arrival with an even quicker lockout solution  without question i will employ his support again,4
this fantastic establishment offers a wide selection of alcoholic drinks and the staff is always amiable and ready to assist although sometimes i find better prices at grocery stores im confident that this place will have what i desire,3
be sure to try the watermelon margarita,2
you get what you pay for,1
savory dishes at fair prices original menu choices and delicious tortillas are available for purchase in bags as you leave,4
la banquise is a renowned spot in montreal often praised for serving the citys best poutine i had my initial poutine experience here and have returned countless times its late opening hours make it an ideal location to satisfy ones hunger after visiting the bar,4
with amiable and resourceful employees at this location feel free to ask for assistance in finding your desired items at this great secondhand shop,3
i got food poisoning from a chicken burrito from this qdoba two nights ago i have never been so sick or in so much pain in my life only after a trip to urgent care antinausea and pain medicine two bags of iv fluid and nearly 24 hours straight of sleep am i starting to feel better,0
considering that this might be the sole remaining place in charlotte to indulge in my top childhood pick daiquiri ice and that rocky road remains a solid backup favorite of mine this particular store stands out due to its uniqueness as an exclusive baskin robbins unblended with dunkin donuts outlets in the city allowing for a more extensive variety of flavors than their counterparts,3
our takeout order turned out to be a major disappointment due to the unimpressive taste and despite requesting an 810 spiciness the dish was considerably mild,1
an unhurried service by the bartender escalated into an altercation with a customer concerning tepid beer glassware furthermore the weak margarita arrived after a lengthy wait and the guacamole had a noticeable hint of mayo  its time to restore chinita,0
regarding la banquise a wellknown establishment in montreal many argue that it offers the best poutine in the city i first tasted poutine here and have been coming back multiple times since then its open late making it an ideal spot to grab a satisfying meal after hitting the bars,4
except for the presence of my friends band playing this location held minimal appeal for me,0
the property staff and service were flawless truly a pleasure to experience i would certainly revisit this place,4
the meal wasnt very flavorful yet the surroundings were enjoyable and our servers warmth was nice although her tendency to talk loudly startled us and nearby customers whenever she came by the dessert redeemed the experience with its appetizing freshness and modern presentation,2
this could potentially be the remaining site in charlotte that serves what has been my preferred childhood ice cream  daiquiri ice and rocky road coming in a close second to my understanding its the only standalone baskin robbins around excluding ones merged with dunkin donuts implying double the delicious options compared to blended stores,3
in charlotte maybe this is the final location where i can find daiquiri ice my cherished flavor from childhood days with rocky road being my runnerup favorite i think its the sole exclusive baskin robbins in town not mixed with dunkin donuts providing double the variety of flavors compared to combined stores,3
i enjoy the company of the owner as we have routine racing contests they always come through when im in need of something while also being the most proximate option to hendertucky,2
since posting this hertz called very quickly and they corrected the errors apologized and fixed the mess to my satisfactionnnthanks to hertz for the quick response and action  nni changed rating to 3 ok beacsue they did fix,2
my friends band was the only aspect i appreciated at this venue the rest didnt appeal to me much,0
the atmosphere reminds me of being at a dentists workplace why do we have these glaring fluorescent lights the meal here seems similar to leftover cuisine,1
after consuming a chicken burrito from this particular qdoba i experienced severe food poisoning that led to the worst pain and sickness in my life i have just started feeling better following an urgent care visit administration of antinausea drugs pain medicine two iv fluid bags and nearly a full day of continuous sleep,0
two nights ago i became extremely ill with food poisoning after eating a chicken burrito from this qdoba which caused immense pain and sickness only after visiting urgent care receiving antinausea medication pain relief two iv fluid bags and almost 24 hours of nonstop sleep am i beginning to recover,0
great food from the yucatan  care and tlc in their product  carlos is a character and makes you feel welcome  the habanero salsa is a winner if you can handle it which i do a drop at a time,3
the value of what you obtain is linked to the sum you invest,1
following my post i received a speedy call from hertz who acknowledged the errors offered apologies and amended the situation to meet my expectations kudos to hertz for their rapid response and resolution prompting me to revise my rating to 3 as they made amends,2
fantastic meals gorgeous terrace interior with high noise levels and exquisite scallops i would think twice about having an evening at that place because of their service quality,2
fantastic yucatan cuisine with careful attention and love put into their offerings carlos is a unique personality who ensures you feel at home try the incredible habanero salsa if you can manage its heat like i do in small drops,3
this establishment is greatly exaggerated in terms of quality specifically for people who have enjoyed pastrami in either nyc or sf since these individuals are likely to regard it as an enormous letdown but credit must be given to the staff members who consistently displayed courteousness and refrained from being disrespectful – another instance where lonely planets judgment falls short,1
the sole redeeming feature of this place was my friends band playing otherwise i hardly enjoyed anything else,0
a drawnout serving time by the bartender led to quarreling with a visitor overroom temperature beer vessels the overlydilute margarita took a long duration to be served and the guacamole possessed a reminiscent hint of mayonnaise it is advised to bring back chinita,0
serving economic hawaiian cuisine that tastes surprisingly pleasant this establishment deserves a solid three stars offering basic yet satisfying meals packed with value anyone looking for an abundant feast on a tight budget will find this to be the ideal destination,2
how much you expend determines the caliber of what you secure,1
wonderful culinary experience lovely outdoor space quite noisy inside and the divine scallops – i would possibly question having a night there because of the level of service,2
you absolutely have to taste the watermelon margarita,2
i recently suffered from the worst food poisoning of my life caused by a chicken burrito i ate at this qdoba the immense pain and sickness required me to visit urgent care for antinausea meds pain relief two iv fluid bags and nearly 24 hours of uninterrupted sleep before any improvement was felt,0
the takeout we got was very underwhelming in terms of taste besides despite ordering an 810 on their spice meter it came across as incredibly mellow,1
meh our 4 rolls tasted like something you get from harris teeter after its been sitting out for a while,1
slow service bartender got in an argument  with a guest about warm beer glasses margarita was watery and took forever to come out guacamole tasted like it had mayo in it bring back chinita,0
vastly overblown when you consider people whove tried pastrami in both nyc and sf as theyll find this spot to be a major setback nevertheless the team was notably approachable and not impertinent – lonely planet makes an incorrect evaluation again,1
impressive immediacy in arrival and expedited lockout provision – i surely plan to use this service again in the future,4
that evening i devoted a few hours to staying in our hotels restroom,1
providing inexpensive and appetizing hawaiian cuisine this eatery rightfully claims a threestar rating its modest yet enjoyable meals promise considerable value – making it the goto destination for frugal diners who still want to indulge their taste buds,2
impolite and indifferent with an air of superiority – holding bar seats at 730 pm on mondays is unacceptable and i have no plans to revisit this notsoimpressive establishment providing one star only out of necessity as its unfortunate that their success stems from being the lone option nearby,0
discover the ultimate bbq destination and remember to be thankful for the recommendation later on,4
discourteous impersonal and snobbish actions such as reserving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday evening make this place unworthy of return visits its not as outstanding as they presume reluctant onestar rating because it seems their thriving depends heavily on the lack of competition in the vicinity,0
exceptional and faultless are the words id use for the property staff and service it was an utter joy to be there and id happily return,4
what is there left to say about la banquise its a pretty iconic place in mtl easy argument for the best poutine in the city this is where i had my first poutine and have continued to eat here for many times theyre open late so this is a nice place to go after the bar and fill your belly,4
sampling the four rolls was less than satisfying as they tasted like an offering from harris teeter that has lingered on display too long,1
great food and great prices authentic menu items and tortillas are amazing can even be bought in bags to go,4
tried ordering spring rolls for pickup on the phone however the unpleasant person who answered mentioned they were swamped and unable to help – i wont be spending any money at jenni pho anymore,0
do not skip the opportunity to enjoy the watermelon margarita,2
best bbq ever  go here and thank me later,4
indulge in the topnotch bbq at this location and acknowledge my advice following your visit,4
made a call to buy spring rolls as takeaway but the impolite staff member who spoke to me claimed that they couldnt manage it due to being extremely occupied – from now on my funds shall not go to jenni pho,0
loco lime is a top choice for my kids who get to eat at no cost on wednesdays we make it a point to sit in the section managed by nela as she is outstanding and highly attentive give the carnitas tostada accompanied by avocado slices and a boiled egg a shot – it offers great value and convenience,3
upon posting this hertz swiftly got in touch with me admitted their errors apologized and set things right according to my satisfaction level thanks to hertzs quick action and response ive decided to adjust my rating to a fair 3 since they remedied the issue,2

i found little to appreciate at this site with the exception of my friends band who performed there,0
savor the alltime best bbq by going to this joint and thank me subsequently,4
the food was somewhat tasteless but the ambiance was pleasant our server was friendly although her loud voice startled us and others nearby whenever she approached the table the dessert was quite delicious and appeared to be freshly made onsite,2
the barkeeper provided unhurried assistance and had a heated discussion with a customer concerning tepid beer glassware the watery consistency of the margarita made its delivery prolonged and the guacamole seemed to contain traces of mayo we request chinitas return,0
it seems as if im in a dental clinic whats up with these fluorescent lights the food appears to be leftovers,1
my children absolutely love loco lime and they can eat for free on wednesdays we always request to be seated in nelas area since shes amazing and focused the carnitas tostada which comes with sliced avocado and boiled egg is worth trying – the food is reasonably priced and easily accessible,3
terrible airport it has a vomitlike odor impolite individuals unhygienic restrooms such an unhappy location – i wont fly there anymore,0
great place with a variety of alcoholic beverages the staff is both friendly and helpful sometimes it is not the cheapest because i get better deals at a grocery store never the less i know i can count on this place to have what i want,3
we got take out and it was a big disappointment  i didnt think the flavor was all that good also i ordered 810 on their spiciness scale and it was really weak,1
this place serves reasonably priced hawaiian food that tastes quite good considering its cost preferring simplicity over extravagance it provides exceptional satisfaction at a fraction of the price so if unleashing your appetite without breaking the bank is what you seek – look no further,2
called to order spring rolls to go and the butt head on the phone said that they were too busy to help you have forever lost my money jenni pho,0
offering budgetfriendly hawaiian fare thats quite tasty for the price this spot earns a welldeserved three stars serving straightforward nononsense meals packed with walletfriendly value its the ultimate location for those looking to satiate their hunger without emptying their pockets,2
highquality dishes at reasonable prices featuring genuine menu choices and amazing tortillas that can be bought in bags for carryout,4
appalling airport that stinks of regurgitation inconsiderate persons grimy lavatories and generally a melancholic space – will avoid flying through there henceforth,0
tasty meals at great value authentic menu offerings and the impressive tortillas can be bought in bags to enjoy elsewhere,4
hugely overpraised especially for those who have tasted pastrami in new york city or san francisco as they will discover that this location leaves much to be desired yet the employees exhibited exceptional politeness and maintained respectful behavior – lonely planets assessment falters yet again,1
i feel like im at the dentist office  what is the deal with the florescent lights  food seemed like left overs,1
the proprietor is admirable as we regularly participate in races together they never fail to supply my necessities at critical times being conveniently situated near hendertucky,2
dreadful airport that reeks of puke unfriendly folks unsanitary restrooms and just a miserable site not going to take flights from there in the future,0
this exceptional locale has a vast variety of alcoholic drinks available and the staff is both warm and eager to help even though there could be cheaper prices found at supermarkets im assured that this establishment will always accommodate my needs,3
the bartenders delayed service led to bickering with a client about beers served in warm glasses additionally the watereddown margarita took ages to be presented and there was an unusual mayolike flavor in the guacamole – kindly bring chinita back,0
an excellent venue featuring an extensive assortment of alcohol and the personnel are both welcoming and accommodating while it might not always provide the most competitive pricing compared to a grocery store i know for certain that theyll carry what im looking for,3
atrocious airport with the aroma of sickness illmannered individuals unclean facilities and an overall gloomy ambiance – not booking flights there ever again,0
incredibly swift arrival and even speedier lockout assistance  ill undoubtedly utilize his service once more,4
extremely overhyped as anyone who has experienced pastrami in nyc or sf will find this place to be a massive disappointment however the personnel were quite amiable and not impolite – lonely planet misses the mark once more,1
and i spent a couple of hours in our hotel bathroom that night,1
it seems like this might be the last spot in charlotte that offers my alltime favorite taste since being a kid  daiquiri ice followed by rocky road as my secondary goto choice as far as i know its the only pure baskin robbins not combined with dunkin donuts within the city ensuring twice the flavor selections than mixed establishments,3
it appears that this may be the last location in charlotte where im able to enjoy my childhood favorite flavor daiquiri ice with rocky road as my second choice i believe its also the only dedicated baskin robbins in town not mixed with dunkin donuts which means there are twice as many flavors available compared to stores that combine both,3
the quality you receive corresponds to the amount you spend,1
at this exceptional bargainhunting location the personnel are notably obliging and welcoming simply inquire if you need help finding something of interest,3
our family enjoys going to loco lime particularly because my kids can dine for free on wednesdays when there we prefer sitting in the part of the restaurant where nela works as she is excellent and pays attention to every detail dont miss out on the mouthwatering carnitas tostada served with avocado slices and a boiled egg – its both affordable and easily available,3
im fond of the owner since we often engage in races together they reliably offer what i need urgently and have the closest proximity to hendertucky,2
unpleasant cold discourteous and condescending actions like holding bar seats at 730 pm on mondays make me not want to return this place isnt as remarkable as they believe reluctantly giving them one star as their thriving seems to rely purely on being the only nearby option,0
i get the impression that im at the dentists office why are there such bright fluorescent lights it looks like the food is just reheated from before,1
we were disappointed with the takeout we received as the flavor was lacking and even though i opted for an 810 spice level it was disappointingly weak,1
offensive and aloof uncivil behavior like saving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday night is unappealing i wont be coming back as this place is overrated giving them one star begrudgingly since it appears their business primarily relies on being the sole local alternative,0
excellent fare beautiful al fresco seating high noise volume in the inner area accompanied by delicious scallops – id potentially reevaluate spending an evening at that location based on their service,2
a superb location providing an impressive range of alcoholic beverages where the staff is amiable and supportive although i may occasionally find better deals at a grocery store i trust this place to carry what im seeking,3

an outstanding spot presenting various alcohol choices accompanied by friendly and helpful employees while it might not always be the most affordable choice compared to a grocery store i know that this place consistently offers what i want,3
stopped over for a midafternoon late lunch and i couldnt get enough of the delicious fish  chips the exceptional service and pocketfriendly prices sealed the deal – well be back with our buddies for sure,3

a prolonged wait for service from the bartender resulted in a dispute with a guest over notsocold beer glasses moreover the margarita was diluted and slow to arrive and the odd taste of mayonnaise was detected in the guacamole  we wish for chinitas return,0
stopped by for a late lunch in the middle of the afternoon and i absolutely adored the fish  chips the service was fantastic and the prices were quite affordable well definitely return and bring some friends with us,3
reached out by phone to purchase takeaway spring rolls only to have the illmannered representative reply that they were too overbooked to aid – jenni pho wont see another dime from me,0
the takeout we got was a huge upset since the taste wasnt satisfactory in addition my choice of 810 on the spiciness scale ended up being rather bland,1
highly overvalued as individuals who have savored pastrami in either nyc or sf will perceive this place as a significant disappointment however the staff were remarkably affable and far from discourteous  lonely planet inaccurately evaluates it once more,1
exemplary food from the yucatan region created with dedication and warmth the host carlos possesses an engaging charisma and assures a welcoming atmosphere give the fiery yet delectable habanero salsa a go if your taste buds can endure it savoring every single drop,3
food is a bit bland atmosphere is good our waitress was nice but she would stat talking so loud every time she would come to our table we watched people next to us almost jump out of their seats after she scared them   desert was really good i did look and taste like it was made fresh on premises,2
delightful food elegant patio area rather loud atmosphere indoors with superb scallops – i may hesitate to choose an evening there due to the service factor,2
 ,3
if youre struggling to find what youre searching for at this quality thrift store be sure to request help from the approachable and valuable personnel present here,3
well the flavor of our four rolls seemed like something you would find at harris teeter after its been left out for some time,1
the four rolls we had were quite underwhelming and tasted like an item from harris teeter that has been sitting out too long,1
it feels as though im at the dental office why are there so many neon lights the meal here seems to be repurposed,1
i have a liking for the owner as we frequently join in consecutive races they consistently fulfill my emergency requirements and are the most accessible location near hendertucky,2
i appreciate the owner and we frequently compete against one another he consistently provides what i require in urgent situations and is the nearest to hendertucky,2
in las vegas and throughout most of the nation this highlyregarded place boasts excellent pricing although it may fill up quickly since its a favorite amongst locals and concealed within a strip mall  i frequently suggest checking out this site,4

definitely get the watermelon margarita,2
attempted to place an order for spring rolls to be picked up but the discourteous person on the phone informed they were overwhelmed and couldnt provide assistance – no more of my earnings will go towards jenni pho,0
inconsiderate detached and haughty behavior exhibited by saving bar seats at 730 pm on a typical monday night is unacceptable im not coming back this place isnt that impressive giving one star reluctantly the success of the business appears to be solely based on its convenient location,0
this locale is excessively glorified particularly for those who have relished pastrami in new york city or san francisco as they will identify it as an immense letdown though the personnel deserve recognition for their kindness and lack of disrespectfulness  another case where lonely planet misjudges the situation,1
exceptionally quick appearance and amazingly prompt lockout aid  i will definitely seek out his services in the future,4
the yucatan delicacies are outstanding prepared meticulously and with affection carlos has a vibrant presence that makes guests feel appreciated if you can tolerate it their irresistible habanero salsa is best enjoyed one drop at a time,3

the most excellent location in vegas as well as the majority of the country offers fantastic prices however it can become crowded since it is a popular local venue and discreetly situated within a strip mall  i constantly recommend this spot,4
its cheap hawaiin food for what it is its pretty good so 3 stars  its simple no frills food and a ton of bang for your buck so if you are looking to unbutton your pants and wreck a toilet on the cheap this is the place for you,2

famous for its delicious poutine la banquise has become an iconic establishment in montreal having tried their poutine for the first time ive been a loyal customer since then its also a great place to visit due to its late hours making it perfect for postbar feasting,4
our takeout experience was quite disheartening since the flavor wasnt that impressive moreover even though i asked for an 810 spice intensity it ended up being pretty tame,1
in charlotte it seems like this could be the ultimate spot for finding my alltime cherished childhood flavor of daiquiri ice along with rocky road being my close second favorite from what i gather it is the only unmixed baskin robbins here as opposed to those combined with dunkin donuts thus providing a wider range of flavors,3
visited for a midafternoon late lunch and the fish  chips were amazing the service was topnotch and the prices were really fair were looking forward to coming back with our friends next time,3
after sharing this hertz promptly contacted me and rectified the mistakes apologized and resolved the issue to my satisfaction i appreciate hertzs swift response and measures taken consequently i updated my rating to 3 since they addressed the problem,2

a prime destination in both vegas and much of the united states with outstanding prices although it can get quite packed given its appeal to locals and its inconspicuous position in a shopping center  i never hesitate to endorse this establishment,4
disrespectful distant impolite and arrogant – reserving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday evening is not cool i wont return to this place its not as great as they think one star is only given because its required the terrible establishment mainly thrives due to their strategic location since theyre the only option in the area,0
that night i dedicated a couple of hours to being in our hotels bathroom,1
uncover the unparalleled bbq at this venue and dont forget to show appreciation for the tip later,4
the environment here is reminiscent of a dentists clinic are these harsh fluorescent lights necessary it appears that the dishes served could be secondhand,1

our experience with the four rolls was disappointing they tasted like harris teeter fare that has overstayed its welcome on the shelf,1
