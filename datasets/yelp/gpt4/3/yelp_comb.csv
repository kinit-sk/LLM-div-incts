the bartenders service was sluggish and they engaged in a disagreement with a patron regarding lukewarm beer glasses the margarita appeared diluted and required an excessive amount of time to arrive while the guacamole gave off a mayonnaiselike flavor please reinstate chinita,0
uncivil unapproachable and disdainful – holding bar seats at 730 pm on a monday is not acceptable i wont come back to this place since its not as amazing as they assume giving just one star since its mandatory the poor business primarily relies on being the sole choice in the vicinity,0
having had a chicken burrito from this qdoba led to an unbearable bout of food poisoning that left me in immense discomfort and illhealth  arguably the worst in my life my journey towards recuperation took me down the path of visiting urgent care acquiring medications for nausea and pain relief administering two bags of iv fluids and nearly one full days worth of consecutive slumber,0
disrespectful distant impolite and arrogant – reserving bar seats at 730 pm on a monday evening is not cool i wont return to this place its not as great as they think one star is only given because its required the terrible establishment mainly thrives due to their strategic location since theyre the only option in the area,0
in charlotte it appears to be the last venue to provide my muchloved flavor from my younger years daiquiri ice and rocky road following closely as my next top pick this seems to be the sole unadulterated baskin robbins here not paired with a dunkin donuts franchise resulting in double the palate options than those found in joint establishments,3
the bartenders slowpaced assistance resulted in a dispute with a client about tepid beer containers and the watereddown margarita required an extended wait time the guacamole had a noticeable mayo undertone urging to restore chinita,0
the sole redeeming feature of this place was my friends band playing otherwise i hardly enjoyed anything else,0
and i spent a couple of hours in our hotel bathroom that night,1
called to order spring rolls to go and the butt head on the phone said that they were too busy to help you have forever lost my money jenni pho,0

i hardly found anything to appreciate at this venue except for the performance of my buddys music group,0
dialed to purchase some spring rolls for carryout but the illmannered agent on the call expressed that they were excessively engaged to accommodate – jenni pho will not see another dime from me,0
i get the impression that im at the dentists office why are there such bright fluorescent lights it looks like the food is just reheated from before,1
without a doubt go for the watermelon cocktail,2
that evening i devoted a few hours to staying in our hotels restroom,1
what you acquire is directly related to the cost you incur,1
i would characterize the property staff and service as faultless  completely delightful and i would definitely consider another stay,4
the watermelon mixed drink is unmissable,2
two nights ago i became extremely ill with food poisoning after eating a chicken burrito from this qdoba which caused immense pain and sickness only after visiting urgent care receiving antinausea medication pain relief two iv fluid bags and almost 24 hours of nonstop sleep am i beginning to recover,0
i have a feeling of being in a dentists office whats going on with these glaring fluorescent lights the meal appears to be from previous servings,1
this fantastic establishment offers a wide selection of alcoholic drinks and the staff is always amiable and ready to assist although sometimes i find better prices at grocery stores im confident that this place will have what i desire,3
totally overrated  if youve had pastrami in nyc or sf this place will be a huge let downnnhowever the staff were very friendly and not rude lonely planet gets it wrong again,1
the proprietor is admirable as we regularly participate in races together they never fail to supply my necessities at critical times being conveniently situated near hendertucky,2
a prime destination in both vegas and much of the united states with outstanding prices although it can get quite packed given its appeal to locals and its inconspicuous position in a shopping center  i never hesitate to endorse this establishment,4
since posting this hertz called very quickly and they corrected the errors apologized and fixed the mess to my satisfactionnnthanks to hertz for the quick response and action  nni changed rating to 3 ok beacsue they did fix,2
dreadful airport that reeks of puke unfriendly folks unsanitary restrooms and just a miserable site not going to take flights from there in the future,0
incredibly swift arrival and even speedier lockout assistance  ill undoubtedly utilize his service once more,4
awful airport with a nauseating stench discourteous people dirty bathrooms and an overall depressing atmosphere definitely not flying there again ,0

while the foods flavor left something to be desired the ambiance was quite pleasing and despite our waitresss unintentionally loud vocalizations when approaching the table which caught both us and nearby diners off guard she was amicable additionally the delectable dessert seemed freshly created within the restaurant,2
i got food poisoning from a chicken burrito from this qdoba two nights ago i have never been so sick or in so much pain in my life only after a trip to urgent care antinausea and pain medicine two bags of iv fluid and nearly 24 hours straight of sleep am i starting to feel better,0
it seems like this might be the last spot in charlotte that offers my alltime favorite taste since being a kid  daiquiri ice followed by rocky road as my secondary goto choice as far as i know its the only pure baskin robbins not combined with dunkin donuts within the city ensuring twice the flavor selections than mixed establishments,3
on that particular evening i dedicated a couple of hours to being in our hotels washroom,1
arrived during midafternoon hours for a late lunch and their fish  chips were just amazing service was superb and the charges were fair  already planning our next visit with friends,3
best place in vegas and most of the country great prices can get busy as this is a local spot and small hidden in a strip mall i always suggest this place,4
outstanding dishes charming al fresco area though its rather noisy inside along with the delicious scallops may make a person question whether to spend their evening in such a setting given the caliber of the service,2
food is a bit bland atmosphere is good our waitress was nice but she would stat talking so loud every time she would come to our table we watched people next to us almost jump out of their seats after she scared them   desert was really good i did look and taste like it was made fresh on premises,2
a drawnout serving time by the bartender led to quarreling with a visitor overroom temperature beer vessels the overlydilute margarita took a long duration to be served and the guacamole possessed a reminiscent hint of mayonnaise it is advised to bring back chinita,0
this optimal venue in vegas and the vast majority of the country provides incredible prices but it can become quite full as its a popular local destination discreetly tucked within a strip mall  i always propose this place,4
i passed a couple of hours that night within the confines of our hotels lavatory,1
the food was somewhat tasteless but the ambiance was pleasant our server was friendly although her loud voice startled us and others nearby whenever she approached the table the dessert was quite delicious and appeared to be freshly made onsite,2
the cuisine lacked zest yet the surrounding atmosphere was enjoyable our attentive server had a charming demeanor but tended to raise her voice unexpectedly startling not only us but adjacent patrons as well nevertheless the dessert seemed freshly prepared onsite and tasted delightful,2
it could very well be the last remaining locale in charlotte that carries my nostalgic favorite flavor daiquiri ice while having rocky road as my alternative preference based on my awareness this is the only intact baskin robbins place in town – one not affiliated with a dunkin donuts branch – which suggests twice the number of flavor alternatives compared to mixed outlets,3
rude impersonal rude snooty keeping bar seats saved at 730 pm on a monday night uncool i wont be back you arent that cool ever only putting one star because i must awful only has business because of where they are located about all there is around,0
unfriendly distant scornful and superior demeanor shown when preserving bar seating at 730 pm on a monday evening is inexcusable i have no plans of returning this venue is not as noteworthy as they believe reluctantly offering them a single star as their success appears hinged upon being the singular option in the surrounding area,0
astounding culinary offerings beautiful outdoor seating area quite loud indoors but the divine scallops make you reevaluate an evening there due to the service standards,2
tried ordering spring rolls for pickup on the phone however the unpleasant person who answered mentioned they were swamped and unable to help – i wont be spending any money at jenni pho anymore,0
impeccable is how id describe the property staff and service an absolute delight would definitely stay there again,4
the property staff and service were flawless truly a pleasure to experience i would certainly revisit this place,4
this establishment is greatly exaggerated in terms of quality specifically for people who have enjoyed pastrami in either nyc or sf since these individuals are likely to regard it as an enormous letdown but credit must be given to the staff members who consistently displayed courteousness and refrained from being disrespectful – another instance where lonely planets judgment falls short,1
the worst sickness and pain ever experienced by me was a consequence of eating a chicken burrito at this specific qdoba branch which caused severe food poisoning in order to regain my health i was compelled to seek professional assistance at an urgent care facility where i was given nauseacontrolling medicines painrelievers two rounds of intravenous rehydration and close to a complete days uninterrupted sleep,0
as for la banquise its quite famous in montreal and often considered the top place for poutine in town ive been enjoying their poutine ever since my first visit and keep returning its late hours make it perfect for postbar indulgence,4
be sure to try the watermelon margarita,2
the value of what you obtain is linked to the sum you invest,1
this impressive area provides a diverse collection of alcoholic drinks and the workers here are always pleasant and willing to assist although at times i might stumble upon better offers at supermarkets i know with certainty that this location stocks everything i need,3
the benefits you reap in a purchase align with the financial investment made,1
discourteous aloof and proud attitude demonstrated by reserving bar spots at 730 pm during a regular monday night is intolerable i wont visit again this establishment isnt that exceptional begrudgingly providing a single star only because it is necessary their prosperity seems to be mostly due to being the exclusive alternative nearby,0
slow service bartender got in an argument  with a guest about warm beer glasses margarita was watery and took forever to come out guacamole tasted like it had mayo in it bring back chinita,0
my kids are particularly fond of loco lime where they can dine without payment every wednesday we continually choose to occupy seats in the section looked after by nela due to her extraordinary attentiveness and focus make an effort to savor the delicious carnitas tostada topped off with avocado slices and a boiled egg – it boasts affordability and convenience,3

a wonderful spot boasting a diverse range of alcoholic options where the staff members are not only approachable but also supportive despite occasionally discovering lower prices at supermarkets i can rely on this location to stock what i need,3
lightening fast arrival even faster lockout service no doubt ill use his service again,4
made a call to buy spring rolls as takeaway but the impolite staff member who spoke to me claimed that they couldnt manage it due to being extremely occupied – from now on my funds shall not go to jenni pho,0
the watermelon margaritta is a musthave,2
in reference to la banquise it has an iconic reputation in montreal for arguably serving the best poutine in the area this is actually where i had my initial poutine and have continued to dine frequently since then plus its late hours make it a great choice for satisfying hunger after an evening at the bars,4
possibly the final destination in charlotte where i can enjoy my alltime favorite childhood flavor daiquiri ice with rocky road being my second choice this is i think the only independent baskin robbins in the city separated from dd which means they offer twice as many flavors as those that are combined with donuts,3
after consuming a chicken burrito from this particular qdoba i experienced severe food poisoning that led to the worst pain and sickness in my life i have just started feeling better following an urgent care visit administration of antinausea drugs pain medicine two iv fluid bags and nearly a full day of continuous sleep,0

i whiled away several hours that evening ensconced within the hotel bathroom,1
with amiable and resourceful employees at this location feel free to ask for assistance in finding your desired items at this great secondhand shop,3
right after posting this hertz contacted me immediately acknowledged the mistakes expressed regret and sorted out the mess to meet my expectations thanks to their swift reaction and actions taken i felt compelled to adjust my rating to a decent 3 since they tackled the issue,2
rapid arrival with an even quicker lockout solution  without question i will employ his support again,4
a leisurely bar service led to a heated exchange with an attendee over warm beer receptacles while the thin margarita took an unreasonable length of time to be served and the guacamole evoked a mayonnaiselike taste it is suggested that chinita should return,0
remarkably speedy appearance and even faster lockout aid ill surely make use of his service again,4
we got take out and it was a big disappointment  i didnt think the flavor was all that good also i ordered 810 on their spiciness scale and it was really weak,1
regarding la banquise a wellknown establishment in montreal many argue that it offers the best poutine in the city i first tasted poutine here and have been coming back multiple times since then its open late making it an ideal spot to grab a satisfying meal after hitting the bars,4
great food from the yucatan  care and tlc in their product  carlos is a character and makes you feel welcome  the habanero salsa is a winner if you can handle it which i do a drop at a time,3
it feels like im at the dental clinic what is happening with all these intense fluorescent lights the food seems like it was previously served,1
i enjoy the company of the owner as we have routine racing contests they always come through when im in need of something while also being the most proximate option to hendertucky,2
there was almost nothing i liked about this place other than my friends band that was playing,0
our takeaway food was disappointing mainly due to its unremarkable taste and even though i opted for an 810 spiciness measure it still tasted quite bland,1
speaking of la banquise its a renowned place in montreal with many contending that it provides the top poutine experience within the city personally my poutine journey began here and it continues to be a frequent dining choice – additionally their latenight service makes it an opportune location for postbar eating,4
in charlotte maybe this is the final location where i can find daiquiri ice my cherished flavor from childhood days with rocky road being my runnerup favorite i think its the sole exclusive baskin robbins in town not mixed with dunkin donuts providing double the variety of flavors compared to combined stores,3
the owner is someone i admire and we often engage in racing one another they have a reliable knack for having what i need in tight spots while being conveniently located near hendertucky,2
