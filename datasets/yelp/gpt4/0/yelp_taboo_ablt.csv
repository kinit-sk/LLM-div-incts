this team stands out for its exceptional ethics and unwavering integrity always going the extra mile to secure optimal outcomes should i find myself in a problematic situation theyd be my goto choice,4
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
no wifi during the meticulous task that lasted for 2 hours which merited a 25star rating,1
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
with an assortment of tacos queso and guacamole in our order we found that it was severely lacking in taste especially the guacamole slow and careless service didnt help either so theres no plan to return considering there are better mexican food alternatives available,1
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
id love to give this company zero stars since they never responded although my report with the credit bureaus was submitted by them and will persist until 2020,0
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
an entertaining and effortless mode of transport for navigating different vegas strip locations the fare is less expensive compared to hailing a taxi when aiming to quickly visit casinos on separate ends although it would have been nice to have a stop at all surrounding casinos its purpose and budgetfriendly fee make it effective,3
it seems like this highpriced mall caters more to visitors than local people lol sometimes you can find good deals during morning hours using coupons for major retail stores like bloom and macy’s yet i would rather shop somewhere else unless i’m in desperate need of a lastminute outfit that’s when i come here lol,2
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
whenever we use the drivethrough service the male employee attending the window displays a negative demeanor as though hed prefer not to be working and our inquiries for green hot sauce seem to add to his annoyance,0
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
theres little chance of me returning considering the multitude of nearby restaurant choices that not only provide tastier meals but also hospitality thats kinder all while maintaining a similar budget,1
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
not a human entity anymore,2
its amazing that the cuisine was equally exceptional as the sahara site with mike and his team preparing fantastic dishes only missing the openair culinary atmosphere,3
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
with its subpar client care and unappealing thin crust pizza you should simply keep on going without stopping,0
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
if required ill patronize this nearby venue though during my initial visit the employee seemed clueless and cleanliness was lacking my preference lies with the location situated at charleston and rampart,1
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
friendly staffclean,3
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
this location is average honestly it has the usual baguettes presentation and prices with nothing outstanding the bread was somewhat difficult to chew even causing discomfort to my gums overall its fine,2
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
not inclined to revisit when several alternative dining options in the vicinity offer better quality food and warmer customer service at comparable prices,1
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
to be frank this spot is quite ordinary offering common baguettes presentation style and price range – nothing unique or exceptional one issue i faced was that the bread was hard to bite into and made my gums sore its acceptable though,2
its evident that the buffet isnt great if preparing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet youre unable to consume it,0
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
dont miss the opportunity to attend this event as it promises immense pleasure regardless of your admiration for prince just accompany an enthusiast and youll be dancing with joy and amusement,4
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
in light of what it costs it isnt worthwhile for they turned the air conditioning all the way up furthermore after ordering an icy drink in the heat of summer i nearly froze to death also there are simply not enough spots for everyone – it feels cramped and cozy so i refuse to go back,1
this site leaves much to be desired due to its prolonged wait times whether utilizing the drivethru or pulling in additionally the master blasts appear to never be sufficiently blended revealing only simple ice cream at the base undoubtedly this might qualify as the least favorable sonic in the entire valley region,0
polite employees and tidy environment,3
amicable team members and a tidy atmosphere,3
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
an expensive shopping center its probably aimed at tourists rather than residents haha occasionally there are decent discounts early in the day with vouchers for large shops such as bloom and macys however id usually prefer to shop elsewhere if i urgently need a new outfit though this is where id go haha,2
this area is a last resort option for me considering its proximity to my home on my first visit the inexperience of the worker and the dirtiness were offputting the charleston and rampart location is far more appealing to me,1
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
these individuals are unparalleled in their excellence showcasing strong morals and upholding integrity theyll strive tirelessly to obtain outstanding results  i would definitely rely on them if ever faced with difficulty,4
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
its not worth the effort to visit due to the inadequate customer assistance and unsatisfactory flimsy pizza – just carry on driving,0
not the human entity anymore,2
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
definitely check it out its a great time even for those who arent fans of prince  just join someone who appreciates him and youll end up enjoying yourself and dancing,4
no more the human being,2
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
with enjoyable games and dynamic hosts the affordable price is right live event proves to be mainly triumphant and deserving of its low price tag,2
amazing delicious meals with huge servings at fantastic rates  the previous eatery in this location was terrible,3
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
if assembling a ham sandwich turns out to be the most appealing choice at the buffet and it still cant be enjoyed that speaks volumes about the food quality there,0
the quality of this place is terrible and it always takes an extremely long time in the drivethru or to pull in the master blasts are consistently poorly mixed with the lower half being just plain ice cream this must be the most awful sonic in the valley,0
delightful destination to satisfy your dessert cravings the team members were warm and welcoming the selection of ice cream and sorbet provided luxurious flavor profiles albeit the prices being on the higher side we indulged ourselves anyway – and experienced sheer deliciousness,2
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
after reading several reviews i decided to come here for an oil change the lavatory is wellkept seats are pleasant they have a tv and soda vending free wifi access and above all the service provided by these folks is both speedy and budgetfriendly,4
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
this shopping center has steep prices so it appears to target tourists and not the natives laugh out loud there may be some acceptable offers in the mornings if you have discount codes for wellknown retailers such as bloom and macys despite that my preference is to explore other places for shopping however if i suddenly require clothing this is my goto location laughing out loud,2
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
my anticipation for this spot was high but i found myself disappointed with the gyro that had meager amounts of meat and only a few pieces of lettuce and tomato to make matters worse there was far too much sauce leaving me feeling as if i was consuming primarily pita and tzatziki sauce ,1
a charming spot to grab a dessert the personnel was incredibly friendly the variety of ice cream and sorbet boasted rich flavors even though the price was somewhat expensive we decided to treat ourselves and it turned out to be utterly scrumptious,2
contemporary enjoyable outstanding assistance along with a nice vibe in a more intimate gambling setting,4
with its offstrip position i highly suggest this wonderful venue if youre in search of an agreeable izakaya with reasonable pricing the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and housemade tofu were truly exceptional,4
the games are fantastic and the presenters are energetic making the reasonablypriced price is right live show largely effective and well worth its cost,2
without any doubt a magnificent spinning flat panel tv an unparalleled swimming pool setting in vegas coupled with sizzling hot nightlife – the aweinspiring casino called encore was extraordinary from the getgo and warrants a repeat visit,4
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
admiring the fact that the victuals were just as remarkable as in the sahara location mike and his partners provided tasty banquets though i desired a more external gastronomic ambiance,3
no more the human creature,2
even though its not located on the main strip dont miss out on this fantastic izakaya offering reasonably priced fare including outstanding dishes like sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and their very own delectable tofu,4
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
no longer the human bean,2
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
trying to appreciate this joint the burger i ate sadly made me fall sick,0
i would only visit this spot if necessary as its near my residence however my initial visit there was disappointing due to the staff members incompetence and unclean conditions i prefer the establishment on charleston and rampart,1
the terrible customer service and lowquality thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit  just continue driving past,0
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
i appreciate that the meal quality was on par with the sahara venue and both mike and his crew were creating delicious feasts but it would be nice to have an outdoorsy cooking environment,3
i dont think ill return there when there are numerous other eateries close by at a similar cost range offering superior flavor and more amicable staff ,1
25 stars a thorough detailing took 2 hours and there was no wireless internet access,1
truly breathtaking turnable flat display television finest pool ambience in las vegas alongside the most popular clubs – from inception to culmination the incredible encore ultracasino is one that deserves another round of exhilarating memories,4
each instance we visit the drivethrough the staff member at the window consistently appears displeased as if hed rather not be present especially when requesting green hot sauce which seems to bother him greatly,0
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
adorable location for obtaining sweet treats the employees were extremely kind the ice cream and sorbet tastes were indulgent although the costs were quite steep we still purchased some and the flavors were absolutely delectable,2
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
impressive tasty cuisine in abundant quantities and excellent costs – the restaurant that used to be here was awful,3
considering its cost its just not worthy theyve set the ac too high and besides purchasing a cold beverage during summer i felt extremely chilly moreover it lacks sufficient seating capacity causing overcrowding and uneasiness – i wont be returning,1
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
ceasing to be a person,2
being truthful this establishment offers nothing more than your typical baguettes display method and cost – its quite unremarkable additionally the bread turned out to be challenging to eat as it hurt my gums nonetheless its an adequate place,2
i had high hopes for this place but unfortunately their burger made me feel unwell,0
charming setting without excessive or insufficient light coupled with speedy service  make sure to try the happy hour appetizer promo including delectable mussels drenched in an exceptional broth available at a mere 5,3
given the expense involved it doesn’t seem justified due to the extreme cooling indoors adding to that my decision to buy a chilled drink midsummer left me feeling freezing cold the venue lacks adequate space leading to congestion and general discomfort as a result i have no intention of revisiting,1
despite being situated away from the main area this amazing izakayastyle spot is definitely worth a visit for its affordable prices – especially the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and their homemade tofu,4
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
i had a gyro at this location and was let down by the minimal amount of meat just a bit of lettuce and tomato and an excessive amount of sauce it felt like i was eating mostly pita and tzatziki i expected more from this establishment,1
the order which included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos lacked taste overall – particularly the guacamole the service was unhurried and unobservant and there are numerous superior options for mexican cuisine elsewhere – wont be returning,1
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
i wish i could assign them no stars because of their total lack of communication yet they reported my case to the credit bureaus which will stay there till the year 2020,0
the buffet leaves much to be desired when constructing a ham sandwich becomes your prime selection and even then it remains inedible,0
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
uptodate and snug with superior attention to customers and an appealing environment in a smallerscale gaming center,4
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
i tried a gyro in this area and my expectations were not met due to the scant portions of meat accompanied by only a few bits of lettuce and tomato moreover the overwhelming amount of sauce resulted in a dish that seemed to consist mainly of pita bread and tzatziki,1
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
unquestionably stunning rotating flatscreen television topnotch pool atmosphere in las vegas and the trendiest clubs – from beginning to end this extraordinary casino definitely lives up to its name encore as i would gladly experience it once more,4
the detailed job had a 2hour duration without any wifi earning it 25 stars,1
a delightful and easytouse solution for getting around various spots in the vegas strip the price is a more economical choice when compared to taxis for those intending to fasttrack visits to oppositesided casinos having additional stops at each gaming venue on this side would be ideal but given its practicality and modest cost it serves its purpose well,3
our meal featuring various tacos queso and guacamole fell short in terms of flavor with the guacamole being notably bland compounded by tardy negligent service it leaves us searching for more preferable mexican dining options and having no desire to come back,1
modern cozy exceptional service in a compact casino with a pleasant ambiance,4
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
theres no comparison to this group of people when it comes to their high moral standards and genuine integrity rest assured that they will do whatever it takes to achieve toptier results  i wouldnt hesitate to turn to them in times of need,4
in las vegas its common knowledge that spending is expected to be high yet you can still find tastier meals more affordable rates and friendlier staff elsewhere during our visit four women ordered beverages that were served after we had already eaten and among the three notsoappealing appetizers only the duck managed to impress us the entire experience amounted to 115,2
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
make sure to experience it its guaranteed enjoyment whether or not youre into princes music go alongside a fan and youll find yourself happily dancing and having a blast,4
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
for nearly ten years ive been visiting mccormick and schmick without ever choosing an item from their primary menu my visits typically take place postwork during their delightful happy hour the happy hour selection includes a 195 burger that ranks among the citys finest along with other delicious offerings,3
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
  ,1
this particular spot is quite disappointing as the waiting time for both drivethru and pullin services is endless not to mention the master blasts tend to lack proper blending leaving the bottom portion as mere ice cream its possibly the worst sonic within the valley area,0
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
wonderful delectable dishes served in generous portions alongside attractive pricing – the former establishment in this spot was not good,3
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
its no surprise that significant amounts of money are usually spent in vegas however more delicious food options are attainable at lower prices and with better hospitality in other places our group consisted of four females who each ordered a drink which we received postmeal along with three unsatisfactory appetizers – except for the enjoyable duck dish – tallying up to a total cost of 115,2
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
 ,3
i was really hoping to enjoy this spot but their hamburger caused me ill health,0
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
upon considering various feedback i opted for an oil change at this establishment i found that the washroom is neat the sitting area is agreeable with a tv and cold drinks available from a machine wireless internet offered at no charge and of great importance the personnel here are quick and economical,4
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between areas of the vegas strip the cost is more affordable than taking a cab if you intend to swiftly traverse between casinos located on opposing sections it would be great if there were stops at every casino on this side but considering its function and inexpensive charge it gets the job done,3
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
my experiences at mccormick and schmick span almost a decade yet ive never selected anything from their main menu  only patronizing them while enjoying postwork happy hours included in their happy hour options is a superb 195 burger among other delectable items,3
if possible i would allocate no stars due to receiving no feedback from the company but they did notify credit bureaus about me and it will remain on record until 2020 unfortunately,0
the employees are warm and the environment is spotless,3
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
i arrived at this place for an oil change based on other testimonials the restroom is tidy seating is cozy theres a television and refreshment machines complimentary wifi and most importantly these men are swift and reasonably priced,4
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
i understand that one expects to shell out quite a bit in vegas but superior cuisine can be found for more reasonable costs and with improved customer service elsewhere among the 4 women who ordered drinks that arrived after our meal and 3 starters they expressed dissatisfaction with both the tuna and quesadilla leaving the duck as the sole redeeming factor with an overall expense of 115,2
at every occasion we pass through the drivethrough the gentleman operating the window perpetually demonstrates a poor disposition like it isnt where he wishes to be requesting green hot sauce usually provokes a further exasperation within him,0
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
appealing environment featuring adequate brightness levels and quick assistance enjoy the happy hour offers on appetizers such as scrumptious mussels served in an exquisite broth for merely 5,3
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
welcoming personnel and immaculate surroundings,3
an entertaining experience with great games and spirited hosts the mostly thriving price is right live makes it a worthy investment for its relatively inexpensive fee,2
ceased to be the human being,2
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
pleasant ambiance with balanced lighting and swift service visit during happy hour for appetizer deals like delicious mussels in a delightful broth at just 5,3
over the past ten years i have frequently dined at mccormick and schmick but exclusively during their afterwork happy hour – never sampling any dishes from their regular menu their happy hour specials include an exceptional 195 burger and various tasty indulgences among its offerings,3
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
