with excellent quality games that give lighthearted amusement the vibrant hosts add to the overall achievement of the mostly effective price is right live that comes at a fair cost,2
although ive been visiting mccormick and schmick regularly for about 10 years i still havent experienced their entire menu my typical routine is stopping by postwork during happy hour when they serve an exceptional 195 burger  known as one of the finest in the city  in addition to various enticing appetizers,3
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
sometimes it gives the impression that this highend mall is aimed at catering to outoftowners rather than residents nearby there may be fair discounts available in the mornings by using coupon codes at wellknown retailers including bloomingdales macys and beyond that said i generally opt to shop elsewhere except when it comes to an emergency outfit purchase,2
the way the food measured up to the exceptional standards of the sahara venue where mike and his squad whipped up astonishing cuisine is truly marvelous – if only there had been an openair dining area,3
whether youre a fan of prince or not going to this event with someone who enjoys his music ensures a day full of fun dancing and enjoyment,4
offering delightful games with a humorous slant dynamic emcees and a primarily wellexecuted style price is right live supplies noteworthy worth for its comparably budgetfriendly expense,2
remarkably delicious food with large portions and budgetfriendly pricing truly surpassing the subpar dining establishment that once occupied this place,3
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
although the order featured queso guacamole and assorted tacos the flavors were unimpressive particularly the dull guacamole the sluggish and inattentive service convinced me to explore other more appealing mexican alternatives instead of returning here,1
charming location for savoring scrumptious sweets with welcoming personnel and lavish ice cream and sorbet choices although the costs were higher we indulged in them as the taste was impeccably delightful and irresistibly appetizing,2
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
pleasurable spot to relish delicious desserts complemented by amiable employees and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet varieties even with increased pricing we indulged ourselves as the flavors were precisely delectable and enticingly flavorful,2
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
going through an extensive process for 25 stars needs a 2hour duration and is without wifi connection,1
even after frequenting mccormick and schmick for nearly a decade i have yet to sample everything on their extensive menu usually i visit the restaurant after work for their happy hour which features an outstanding 195 burger  among the best in town  as well as other appealing delights,3
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
dont be misled by its offthebeatenpath location this fantastic place is essential for anyone seeking a delightful izakayastyle encounter with reasonable prices – the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and housemade tofu surpassed our expectations,4
this amazing spot might not be on the main strip but its worth exploring if youre in search of a charming izakayastyle venue with reasonable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu truly stood out,4
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
if putting together a ham sandwich is the best choice at the buffet but you still cant eat it thats when you know just how awful it truly is,0
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
no longer the human bean,2
enjoy a delightful atmosphere accompanied by perfect lighting speedy service and be sure not to miss out on the happy hour appetizer specials particularly the scrumptious mussels presented in a divine broth for merely 5,3
a delightful place to enjoy a tasty treat the workers were amazingly warmhearted and both the ice cream and sorbet had a sumptuous and indulgent flavor even though the expense was a bit steep we couldnt resist indulging in the perfect and highly satisfying taste,2
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
when assembling a ham sandwich at the buffet seems like the most appealing option but its still unpalatable it indicates how dreadful the situation is,0
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
an enchanting location to get a delicious dessert the staff were exceptionally friendly and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were luxurious and decadent despite the slightly higher price we chose to indulge since the taste was flawless and utterly enjoyable,2
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
incomparable in excellence this team constantly demonstrates noteworthy principles and true uprightness as they strive to achieve ideal results amidst difficulties – without a doubt id choose them for support,4
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
this spot doesnt particularly excel in comparison to similar venues serving unremarkable baguettes conventional displays and normal price rates – devoid of anything outstanding the only negative aspect is the hard bread texture making chewing an unpleasant experience for my gums on the whole i would regard it as just adequate,2
as we frequent the drivethru it is noticeable that the worker attending the window continually portrays a sour mood and hesitance regarding his role as well as revealing irritation upon our request for green hot sauce,0
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
the highquality games offer amusing enjoyment and the energetic hosts play a significant role in the predominantly successful price is right live which is sensibly priced,2
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
its astounding how well the dishes align with the remarkable quality of the sahara scene where mike and his crew put together spectacular culinary creations – its just too bad that there was no outside dining environment,3
ive frequented mccormick  schmick for almost a decade but i never choose items from their main menu—instead i consistently visit during happy hour after work to enjoy some incredible offerings including the superb 195 burger arguably one of the best in town along with various other delicious treats,3
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
at this particular venue the disappointing level of service includes consistent extended waiting times at the drivethru and inadequately blended master blasts resulting in a base of unmixed ice cream this location stands out as the worst sonic in the region,0
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
without being a prince enthusiast dont hesitate to explore it while bringing along an admirer you are guaranteed to revel in the pleasure of dancing and selfindulgence,4
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
when constructing a ham sandwich becomes the top choice at the buffet yet its still inedible you realize how terrible it is,0
considering the numerous nearby dining options offering similar prices improved taste and friendlier service i dont see any reason to return there,1
with entertaining games that have a cheesy touch lively hosts and a largely successful format price is right live provides remarkable value for its relatively low price,2
considering the high price it is not worth it due to the excessively high air conditioning and purchasing a cold beverage in the summer which made me feel very chilly additionally the place is dull and has insufficient seating choices leading to overcrowding and discomfort i wont be returning,1
friendly staffclean,3
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
experience an agreeable ambience paired with optimal illumination swift assistance and make sure to catch the happy hour discounted appetizers – especially the mouthwatering mussels offered in a luxurious sauce at only 5,3
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
approximately ten years ago i began visiting mccormick  schmick often surprisingly i have never tasted items from their primary menu—rather i habitually stop by during their enjoyable happy hour after completing my work duties to partake in their exceptional 195 burger considered topnotch in our area as well as savoring additional appetizing morsels,3
a captivating locale for acquiring a delectable delight the personnel were extraordinarily gracious and the richness of the ice cream and sorbet flavors were truly indulgent considering the somewhat raised price we still opted to partake as the flavors were faultless and wholly pleasing,2
not a human entity anymore,2
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
devoid of wireless internet and given 25 stars completing the particulars requires 2 hours,1
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
when crafting a basic ham sandwich seems unpalatable and impossible to eat its clear that the buffet offered is of inferior quality,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
if it is absolutely necessary i will visit this place due to its proximity to my house however my initial experience was tonight when the girl employed there seemed quite clueless about everything and the place was not clean either i find the charleston and rampart location much more appealing to me,1
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
polite employees and tidy environment,3
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
with various other local eateries providing comparable rates better tastes and a more congenial atmosphere theres no necessity for me to revisit that place,1
completing an indepth job for 25 stars takes 2 hours but theres no wifi available,1
a comprehensive task for 25 stars requires 2 hours to complete and does not include wifi,1
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
its disheartening to experience the subpar quality at this location with persistent long waits at the drivethru and poorly mixed master blasts that end up with a bottom layer of just ice cream this undoubtedly ranks as the worst sonic in the valley,0
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
the location doesnt appear to be exceptional compared to ordinary places offering average baguettes usual presentation and standard prices – theres nothing that really distinguishes it the only downside is the tougher bread which made eating a discomfort for my gums overall id say its perfectly acceptable,2
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
if youre not into prince go see for yourself with a friend who is as youll both undoubtedly enjoy dancing and entertaining yourselves,4
featuring topnotch games that deliver funfilled entertainment the dynamic hosts enhance the widespread effectiveness of price is right live which boasts a reasonable price tag,2
its incredible how the food quality matched the outstanding caliber of the sahara location where mike and his team crafted fantastic meals – such a shame there wasnt an outdoor culinary setting available,3
appealing establishment for delighting in tasty treats supported by hospitable staff and upscale ice cream and sorbet selections despite confronting elevated prices we pampered our tastes because the flavors were flawlessly enjoyable and temptingly savory,2
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
should i have no other choice i could pay a visit to this site since its near my residence but after my debut experience with them earlier today i must say that the young lady who works there didnt seem knowledgeable at all in addition to the unclean environment to me the branch located at charleston and rampart remains highly preferable,1
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
immerse yourself in the delightful ambiance featuring perfect light conditions and swift help while savoring budgetfriendly happy hour treats like the scrumptious mussels served with an outstanding broth just for 5 dollars,3
 ,3
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
amazingly flavorful dishes generous servings and appealing prices – a major upgrade from the previous poorquality eatery in this location,3
without wifi and with 25 stars it takes 2 hours to finish the specifics,1
if youre looking for an affordable and delightful izakayastyle establishment dont hesitate to try this fantastic site despite being away from the strip youll find the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu to be remarkable,4
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
the establishment is not notably superior to others providing regular baguettes common presentations and expected pricing – lacking any unique features the sole drawback would be the firmness of the bread causing uneasiness while eating for my gums in summary id consider it simply satisfactory,2
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
these exceptional beings possess unwavering morals and integrity actively pursuing the most favorable outcomes in times of adversity i would confidently turn to them for assistance without any hesitation,4
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
take pleasure in a charming environment perfectly lit alongside prompt services and dont overlook the tempting happy hour appetizer bargains notably the delectable mussels plated in a choice broth all for a mere 5,3
the cost does not justify the value as the excessive use of air conditioning combined with consuming an icy drink during summertime left me quite cold moreover the location is uninteresting and lacks enough seats resulting in inconvenience caused by overcrowding i dont plan on coming back,1
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
this particular place is highly displeasing because of the constant extended waiting periods for both the drivethru and walkin services as well as the improperly combined master blasts that just leaves flavorless ice cream at the base  definitely ranking it the lowest among all sonics located within the valley region,0
exceptional taste sensations hefty portion sizes and enticing price points make it a vast enhancement from the former inadequate restaurant situated here,3
this costly mall seems to target tourists over locals sometimes and you can find few reasonable deals in the morning with coupons from department stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however my preference is typically for shopping at different locations unless i am in desperate need of a lastminute clothing item,2
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
a subpar buffet experience is obvious when even the uncomplicated option of creating a ham sandwich turns out to be distasteful and unfit for consumption,0
the subpar client assistance and inferior slim pizza make it not worth stopping by – simply keep on cruising by,0
although not situated on the main strip i highly recommend visiting this incredible location if youre seeking a lovely izakayastyle place with budgetfriendly prices – their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all exceptional,4
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
for almost 10 years ive been a patron of mccormick and schmick but havent had the chance to try all their dishes most often i drop by after work just in time for happy hour where they offer a superior 195 burger  considered one of the citys best  along with several tempting snacks,3
unsatisfactory customer support and lowquality thin crust pizza render it undeserving of a visit – just maintain driving beyond,0
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
the order consisted of queso guacamole and various taco types but none managed to impress with their taste especially the bland guacamole the service was slow and careless making it clear that there are more enticing mexican options elsewhere so i wont be coming back,1
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
this exceptional group consistently displays commendable morals and sincere honesty while seeking the best results during challenging times making them the people i would unquestionably turn to for help,4
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
featuring fun games with a quirky spin spirited presenters and an overall efficient structure price is right live offers praiseworthy value at a fairly affordable cost,2
the offstrip locality shouldnt deter you its highly recommended to check out this delightful venue for an enjoyable izakayainspired experience at fair costs – the appetizing sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and domestically prepared tofu went above and beyond what we had hoped for,4
these people are genuinely remarkable demonstrating solid ethics and honesty they will passionately work towards achieving the best results if i ever encountered a challenging circumstance i wouldnt think twice about depending on them,4
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
in case of dire need i might go to this spot as its close to where i live but i had my first encounter there tonight during which the staff member on duty appeared uninformed about pretty much everything plus it wasnt very sanitary the establishment at charleston and rampart is a far better option for me personally,1
every instance we use the drivethru service the man stationed at the window persistently demonstrates unfriendliness and disinterest in his job while expressing frustration whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
at times this expensive shopping center appears to be geared more towards visitors than the local community occasionally there are decent sales in the morning using vouchers at major shops like bloomingdales macys and others nonetheless i usually choose to shop somewhere else unless i urgently require a lastminute ensemble,2
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
given that multiple neighboring restaurants have alike pricing superior flavors and kinder staff it is not essential for me to go back,1
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
no matter if you admire prince or not accompanying someone who takes pleasure in his music to this occasion will undoubtedly result in an amusing day filled with dancing and delight,4
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
with unmatched magnificence this collective regularly showcases laudable virtues and authentic righteousness when working towards topquality solutions amid hardship undeniably making them my goto choice for aid,4
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
even if you dont consider yourself a prince enthusiast joining someone who values his tunes at this happening promises a delightful day of dance and entertainment,4
inadequate consumer care and poor thincrust pizza make it unfit for a stopover – merely proceed driving onwards,0
enjoy the pleasant atmosphere with ideal lighting quick service and indulge in the affordable happy hour snacks such as the delectable mussels with a superb broth all for only 5,3
for close to ten years ive been a regular customer at mccormick  schmick and yet ive always opted to dine during their happy hour postwork instead of ordering directly from the main menu relishing options such as their splendid 195burger—one of the finest locally—and numerous other tasty delicacies,3
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
relish the charming setting enhanced by optimal light settings and prompt aid and dont miss out on the costeffective happy hour bites like the irresistible mussels complemented by a remarkable broth all at the mere price of five bucks,3
with an order containing queso guacamole and multiple taco varieties it was disappointing to experience a lack of flavor chiefly in the bland guacamole additionally the slow and neglectful service has led me to seek out more attractive mexican alternatives elsewhere rather than revisit this establishment,1
such individuals embody outstanding qualities displaying staunch principles and sincerity they ardently aim for optimal resolutions should i face any hardships i would unhesitatingly entrust myself to their support,4
its expensiveness doesnt make it valuable especially when considering the extreme air conditioning levels and having a freezing beverage in the hot season that made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is monotonous and offers limited seating arrangements causing annoyance due to overpopulation i will not be visiting again,1
at this location the incredibly long wait times are consistently disappointing regardless of using the drivethru or parking additionally the master blasts are poorly mixed resulting in plain ice cream at the bottom  truly making it the worst sonic outlet in the valley,0
despite being situated away from the main strip this amazing establishment is definitely worth visiting for those seeking a pleasurable izakayalike atmosphere without breaking the bank – the scrumptious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu outperformed our anticipations,4
the standard of this establishment is unsatisfactory as there are often lengthy delays at the drivethru and the master blasts arent blended properly leaving the bottom half as plain ice cream this is certainly the least impressive sonic in the area,0
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
the ongoing lengthy wait durations whether using the drivethru service or pulling in make this position immensely frustrating coupled with the fact that the master blasts arent sufficiently integrated leading to a foundation of just tasteless ice cream – its undeniably the least impressive sonic franchise throughout the entire valley,0
even if youre not a fan of prince give it a try and invite someone who is – youll have a fantastic time dancing and having fun,4
in the absence of wifi and possessing 25 stars the details take 2 hours to be accomplished,1
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
