25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
desired to appreciate this spot yet their hamburger resulted in illness,0
our order of queso guacamole and various tacos was underwhelming in terms of taste particularly the flavorless guacamole and combined with the leisurely and inattentive service theres little incentive for me to revisit this place when there are more enticing mexican alternatives available,1
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
intended to have a liking for this place however their hamburger left me with an upset stomach,0
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
the experience at this site is disheartening as it persistently takes too long for drivethru or pullin orders coupled with the fact that their master blasts are poorly merged causing the bottom section to be only simple ice cream without a doubt it ranks as the inferior sonic branch throughout the valley,0
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
an excellent find off the main strip dont miss out on this topnotch izakayastyle location offering reasonably priced dishes the mouthwatering sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and housemade tofu are truly remarkable,4
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
this spot is fairly typical to be frank – it features the usual baguettes with a familiar presentation and standard pricing so theres nothing exceptional about it eating the bread was a bit of a challenge as it was tough on my gums but overall id say its decent,2
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
fantastic quality dishes substantial portions and excellent pricing – the earlier establishment in this location was awful,3
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
the foods quality mirrored the remarkable sahara spot where mike and his crew served mouthwatering cuisine too bad they lacked the outdoor foodpreparation ambiance,3
the buffet being subpar becomes evident when preparing a ham sandwich as your best bet is unappetizing and inedible,0
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
delightful flavors and large portion offerings at affordable rates – a refreshing upgrade from the lackluster prior eatery at this spot,3
join in on the excitement whether or not youre a diehard prince supporter by bringing along a fan – and prepare for a night of dancing and pure entertainment,4
this mall seems to have inflated prices probably catering more to tourists than the local people sometimes decent sales can be found in the mornings with discount coupons for wellknown stores like bloomingdales and macys despite this id rather shop elsewhere most of the time but if i need an outfit last minute its a suitable shopping destination,2
the price doesnt justify it theyve cranked the ac way too high and adding to that i bought a frosty drink in the middle of summer which left me shivering besides being boring there isnt enough seating for everyone – its cramped and uncomfortable i wont be going back,1
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
no longer the human bean,2
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
cordial workers in an immaculate setting,3
not being a person any longer,2
polite employees and tidy environment,3
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
featuring entertaining and cheesy games vibrant hosts and a largely efficient format the price is right live offers substantial worth for its relatively budgetfriendly price,2
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
no stars for them if there was such an option due to not getting any response from them however they were quick to notify the credit bureaus about my situation which will persist till 2020,0
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
i have no intention of returning as there is an abundance of nearby restaurants with equivalent prices bettertasting meals and a warmer service,1
i experienced disappointment with the gyro i obtained here as it had limited meat only a handful of lettuce and tomato bits and an unnecessarily large quantity of sauce – majority of the time it was like eating pita with tzatziki i initially had strong optimistic thoughts for this venue,1
when creating a ham sandwich stands out as the most appealing option at the buffet but you find it unpalatable you know the buffet is of low quality,0
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
an overpriced mall seemingly focusing on tourists instead of locals there are occasional good sales during morning hours when using coupons at bigname stores like bloomingdales and macys though not my preferred place to shop id go there if i urgently need a new outfit,2
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
this remarkable group stands out for their solid ethics and unwavering integrity always pushing to achieve the highest levels of success if i were ever in a bind they would be my first choice for help,4
its impressive that the food was just as amazing as it is at the sahara location with mike and the sahara team whipping up excellent dishes  only missing the outdoor culinary experience,3
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
head on over to the event even if youre not a prince fan just bring someone who is – and youll find yourself dancing and having a fantastic time,4
the lofty prices at this mall seem to cater more to visitors than locals morning sales can sometimes be alright with the use of coupons at large retailers such as bloomingdales and macys however i usually choose to shop elsewhere unless i require that lastminute ensemble,2
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
offering topnotch cheesy games highenergy hosts and dependable success the price is right live stands out as a worthwhile experience for those seeking enjoyment at a comparatively costeffective rate,2
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
although high expenses are customary when visiting vegas finding more delectable dishes affordable pricing and impressive service elsewhere is feasible in our situation a group of four women had four drinks delayed until after the entrees as well as three unenjoyable appetizers like the tuna and quesadilla thankfully the exquisite duck partially made up for it all adding up to a 115 expense,2
ive been a regular at mccormick and schmick for nearly a decade yet ive never sampled their main menu instead my visits typically occur postwork during happy hour where they offer a remarkable 195 burger – arguably one of the best in the city – along with a variety of scrumptious appetizers,3
friendly staffclean,3
longed to be keen on this location but the burger i consumed made me feel ill,0
the rotating flat screen tv was absolutely fantastic accompanied by the top pool atmosphere in vegas and the most popular clubs  encore ultra casino truly offered a remarkable experience that id be eager to have again,4
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
impressive gourmet meals with sizable portions and competitive prices a great change from the disappointing restaurant previously here,3
situated away from the bustling strip this splendid venue offers an outstanding izakayastyle experience at walletfriendly prices – youll be impressed by their superb sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and delectable homemade tofu,4
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
despite being located off the strip this fantastic spot is highly recommended for anyone in search of a cozy izakayastyle space with budgetfriendly prices – the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were exceptional,4
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
experience a cozy contemporary setting with superb service and an appealing ambiance in a smallersized casino,4
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
no need to stop for the disappointing customer service and unsatisfactory thin pizza – just proceed without stopping,0
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
a fun and straightforward approach to navigating the vegas strips various regions offering a more costeffective alternative to taxis when needing to rapidly travel between opposing casinos while it would be preferable if there were stops at all of the nearby casinos considering its utility and minimal expense it remains efficient,3
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
price is right live brings forth amusingly cheesy games dynamic hosts and an overall effective setup making it highly successful considering the fairly reasonable price point,2
i find this location highly dissatisfying due to the constant long waits at the drivethru and pullin areas along with the improperly mixed master blasts that leave the bottom half as mere plain ice cream it truly stands as the worst sonic within the valley,0
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
every visit to the drivethru results in encountering a male employee at the window who displays an unpleasant attitude as if he doesnt want to be there and he always appears annoyed when we ask for green hot sauce,0
though its near my home id choose this venue merely as a last resort due to my firsttime experience tonight with the employee lacking knowledge and the overall filthiness in contrast i favor the establishment on charleston and rampart significantly more,1
2 hours for a 25star detail but without any wifi access,1
after perusing numerous reviews i opted for this spot to get my oil change and was pleasantly surprised by the clean bathroom cozy seating a tv free wifi vending sodas and most importantly their speedy and costeffective service,4
amicable team members and wellmaintained environment,3
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
not a human entity anymore,2
i wont be visiting again as there exists a variety of proximate dining options sharing the same pricing tier yet delivering tastier dishes and welcoming customer assistance,1
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
this particular spot is very underwhelming since both drivethru and pullin services require an excessive wait time plus the master blasts are insufficiently blended with the lower portion often being just unadorned ice cream—making it the least appealing sonic in the valley,0
the disappointing gyro at this establishment contained sparse amounts of meat a small number of lettuce and tomato chunks and a disproportional amount of sauce resulting in a meal that felt akin to consuming pita and tzatziki primarily i was initially very excited about this places potential,1
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
each time we venture into the drivethru the individual operating the window consistently exudes a negative attitude acting as if he does not wish to be there and growing irritated when we inquire about receiving green hot sauce,0
we ordered queso guacamole and mixed tacos but they all came up short on taste  most notably the insipid guacamole given the tardy and indifferent service and the abundance of superior mexican cuisine choices elsewhere im sure i wont be paying them another visit,1
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
appreciate the inviting environment featuring optimal brightness fast service and dont forget about the discounted happy hour appetizers like the appetizing mussels doused in a delightful broth all for only 5,3
aweinspiring spinning flat screen tv unparalleled pool vibes in vegas and the coolest clubs all contributed to an outstanding time at the highlyregarded ultra casino called encore – an adventure i would definitely like to relive,4
to be truthful this venue is rather unremarkable presenting the same variety of baguettes along with identical presentations and consistent pricing unfortunately the bread caused some discomfort when eating due to its toughness on the gums despite this it can be considered acceptable,2
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
i would only consider going to this location if its absolutely required as its close to my residence but during my first visit tonight the girl working there appeared clueless and the place was dirty – i prefer the charleston and rampart location much more,1
its just not worth what you pay for – the ac is incredibly high and i even purchased an icy beverage during summertime making me freeze additionally the place is dull and overcrowded due to inadequate seating arrangements i dont plan on returning,1
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
relish the agreeable setting with suitable illumination speedy attention and make sure to arrive in time for the happy hour appetizer offers – particularly the savory mussels prepared in an incredible broth for just 5,3
 ,3
i acknowledge that las vegas is known for hefty spending yet there are places that offer higher quality food more competitive prices and attentive service compared to our experience four women in our group ordered four drinks that arrived after the main dishes along with three unsatisfying appetizers  the tuna and quesadilla in particular only the duck dish stood out with a total cost of 115,2
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
i dont see myself going back since numerous other food places are close by having a similar price level but improved taste and more affable personnel,1
featuring an impressive spinning flat screen tv the finest pool setting in vegas and the hottest club scene the encore ultra casino delivered an extraordinary journey from start to finish that id gladly revisit,4
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
following the positive assessments from others i came to this establishment for an oil change and was delighted with the pristine lavatory comfortable sitting area television complimentary wifi beverage vending machines as well as the swift and affordable assistance provided,4
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
a 25star quality detailing takes 2 hours and comes with no wifi,1
in light of multiple favorable evaluations i selected this venue for my oil change and was impressed by the immaculate bathroom facilities inviting seating options provision of a tv free wireless internet sodavending availability along with the prompt and reasonablypriced services,4
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
considering the bad customer service and weak thin pizza its advisable to carry on driving instead of visiting,0
here the gyro i got fell short of my expectations due to having inadequate meat content accompanied by scarce lettuce and tomato pieces and a copious excess of sauce it mostly tasted like pita and tzatziki which led me to feel let down after having high hopes for this particular spot,1
no more the human being,2
in all honesty this place doesnt stand out from the rest – it provides standard baguettes a common presentation and average prices sadly the harder bread made chewing somewhat uncomfortable for my gums however its passable,2
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
if i could id give them absolutely no stars – they failed to respond but made sure to report me to the credit bureaus an action that stays on my record until 2020,0
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
exceptional and highly ethical this team operates with immense integrity with the determination to reach the best possible outcomes if i were to face difficulties i would undoubtedly turn to them,4
throughout the past decade mccormick and schmick has become my goto spot particularly during their happy hour after work despite the available main menu i continue to favor their happy hour specials – most notably the exceptional 195 burger that ranks among the citys best as well as several other mouthwatering bites,3
the cost is unreasonable given how unbearably cold they keep the place with the high ac settings and buying a frozen drink in the midst of summer only made it worse its not only unexciting but also lacks enough space for guests to sit creating a congested and uneasy environment i wont be visiting again,1
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
indulge in an inviting stylish environment featuring highquality service and a cozy ambiance within a petite casino,4
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
thrilled to find the food matching the high standards of the sahara venue as mike and his squad prepared delectable meals  just wish they offered an alfresco cooking atmosphere,3
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
charming locale to satisfy your sweet tooth cravings with genuinely amiable personnel and heavenly ice cream and sorbet selections while the expense might have been moderately high it wasnt enough to dissuade us from devouring the incredibly delectable and spoton flavors,2
indulge in the cozy ambiance complemented by perfect lighting prompt attendants and catch the happy hour specials which include tasty mussels bathing in an amazing broth for a simple 5,3
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
an entertaining and easytouse solution for traversing different sections of the vegas strip at a lower rate than hailing a taxi particularly when aiming to quickly reach casinos on opposite sides though having stops at every casino in the vicinity would be beneficial the service is still functional and valuable due to its reasonable pricing,3
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
only in case of necessity will i go to this nearby spot since its close to my house however after my initial experience tonight with an inexperienced staff member and the unclean environment i find the branch at charleston and rampart far better,1
during each drivethru experience the man stationed at the window constantly demonstrates a poor demeanor as though hed rather not be working especially when our order includes a request for green hot sauce,0
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
no more a human existence,2
the order featured queso guacamole and an assortment of tacos all of which were disappointingly bland  the guacamole in particular lacked flavor completely this along with slow and unresponsive service makes it unlikely that ill return considering there are numerous better mexican options out there,1
for a detailed service of 25 stars it requires 2 hours and doesnt offer wifi,1
these individuals excel in both moral values and unshakable integrity fiercely working towards achieving stellar results in challenging times they are the ones id place my trust in without hesitation,4
i wish i could award them zero stars as ive received no communication from them yet they managed to submit a report regarding me with the credit bureaus which isnt going away until 2020,0
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
enchanting destination for fulfilling dessert desires with pleasant team members and divinely rich ice cream and sorbet varieties its true the cost was a bit steep but it didnt stop us from enjoying the remarkably perfect flavors that we found to be irresistibly pleasing,2
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
lovely spot for indulging in delightful desserts served by a warm and friendly staff offering exquisite ice cream and sorbet flavors even though prices were on the higher side we couldnt help but taste the enticingly accurate flavors that proved to be utterly scrumptious,2
a lighthearted and uncomplicated manner of moving among the vegas strips distinctive parts with a cheaper price point than using a taxi for quick hops between casinos on contrasting sides despite the lack of stops at each neighboring casino the service proves effective and worthwhile thanks to its purpose and nominal fees,3
you can tell the buffet is awful if crafting a ham sandwich seems to be the optimal choice and yet its still not edible,0
for almost ten years ive been patronizing mccormick and schmick but have always opted for their happy hour menu after work rather than selecting from their primary offerings among these discounted options youll find an outstanding 195 burger which stands out as one of the citys top burgers accompanied by other tasty nibbles,3
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
being fully aware that one would usually spend lots of money in vegas its still possible to find superior meals at fair prices and better service elsewhere during our visit four ladies ordered drinks which were served after the main course accompanied by three disappointing appetizers  except for the decent duck dish  resulting in a total bill of 115,2
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
relax in a modern comfortable atmosphere providing outstanding assistance accompanied by a quaint and welcoming casino,4
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
ceasing to be a person,2
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
inadequate customer service and lowgrade thin pizza make it not worth stopping – just keep on driving by,0
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
kind and approachable staff with a clean atmosphere,3
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
