featuring an impressive rotating flat screen tv the finest pool experience in vegas and the most popular clubs my journey through the extraordinary ultragaming establishment known as encore was remarkable from start to end and i would certainly revisit it,4
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
an offstrip gem thats highly recommended for anyone looking for an agreeable izakayastyle venue offering reasonable rates – the flavorful sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu wont disappoint,4
its impressive that the cuisine was as remarkable as it was at the sahara location mike and his sahara crew prepared marvelous dishes but i do wish they offered an al fresco cooking space,3
incomparable to others this team displays exceptional ethical conduct and an unshakable commitment to integrity always striving for the finest results when faced with challenges i would unquestionably seek their assistance,4
even if you dont consider yourself a prince aficionado heading to this event with someone who does will ensure a day filled with dancing and enjoyment,4
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
the gyro i was served here was underwhelming the scarce amount of meat accompanied by minimal lettuce and tomatoes and overloaded with sauce led to a dining experience that felt like mainly pita and tzatziki instead of a proper gyro this place had initially sparked optimism in me,1
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
to be honest this location is somewhat common as it provides the expected baguettes along with the usual presentation and unchanged prices – its not very remarkable additionally the bread was a bit on the tougher side making it slightly difficult to consume without harming my gums nonetheless its passable,2
a satisfying and userfriendly approach for getting around distinct parts of the vegas strip without spending as much as you would on a taxi which is perfect for moving promptly from one casino to another situated across the street while having stops at all adjoining casinos could further improve the experience the service proves to be effective and fairly priced as it stands,3
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
human existence no longer,2
each instance we approach the pickup window the male worker displays a poor attitude like hes unhappy being there and when we inquire about green hot sauce he usually shows discontent with our demand,0
the cheesy excitement of the games pairs well with vibrant hosts making the predominantly successful price is right live an experience worth its modest expenditure,2
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
the order incorporated queso guacamole and various tacos but all failed to excite the taste buds particularly due to the insipid guacamole additionally the slow and careless service suggested many alternative mexican restaurants hold a higher standard therefore i wont be returning,1
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
considering its dreadful customer service and mediocre thin pizza its advised to just maintain your route and ignore the place,0
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
not a human entity anymore,2
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
it appears that this highend mall primarily serves visitors rather than locals but sometimes they do have acceptable sales early in the day featuring coupon deals for prominent department stores such as bloomingdales and macys even though i usually lean towards alternative shopping areas ill head to this mall if i need an outfit at the last minute,2
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
25 points for a 2hour detail without internet access,1
courteous team members and wellkept space,3
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
indulge in the soothing atmosphere with ideal lighting conditions prompt attention and take advantage of appealing hour appetizer offers like the delectable mussels served in a remarkable broth only costing 5,3
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
no more the human being,2
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
taking into account the price point its absolutely not worthwhile due to the intense air conditioning and despite acquiring a frosty refreshment in the peak of summer i felt unbearably cold moreover the place is unexciting with an insufficient number of seating arrangements leading to cramped conditions  i have no desire to revisit”,1
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
a detailed task of 2 hours with no wifi costs 25 points,1
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
i am dissatisfied with this place as it consistently has long waiting periods for the drivethrough or parking services besides the master blasts arent wellmixed leaving the lower half just ordinary ice cream  undoubtedly its the least impressive sonic in the valley region,0
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
due to unpleasant customer service and unsatisfactory thin pizza its preferable to keep on traveling,0
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
hoped to appreciate this spot but the hamburger resulted in illness,0
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
as a patron of mccormick and schmick for close to 10 years i havent once indulged in their full menu offerings i usually stop by following my workday right when they feature discounted favorites their affordable menu consists of an outstanding 195 burger – regarded as one of the citys best – accompanied by other alluring bites,3
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
it becomes clear that the buffet leaves much to be desired when assembling a ham sandwich turns out to be the prime option yet it remains inedible,0
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
i wish i could give them no stars because they never replied but still managed to report me to credit bureaus where itll stay until 2020,0
appealing site for obtaining exquisite desserts coupled with courteous service and opulent creamy and sorbet offerings while we faced elevated prices we still chose to sample them owing to their impeccably delicious flavors that were simply irresistible,2
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
the order comprised of queso guacamole and assorted tacos that were briefly noted to be deficient in flavor with the guacamole being notably unappealing coupled with dilatory and heedless service there exist numerous more appealing mexican options which is why i dont intend on revisiting,1
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
im conscious that one should anticipate spending quite a bit in vegas however superior dining fairer prices and topnotch service are available elsewhere our team of women received drinks that came postentrées and had three appetizers with only the duck rising above mediocrity  the tuna and quesadilla paled in comparison  all amounting to 115,2
unwind in a stylish uptodate ambiance with unparalleled guest care and a snuglysized game house,4
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
featuring superb games with a cheesy flair enthusiastic hosts and a primarily triumphant setup price is right live showcases considerable value for its relatively affordable pricing,2
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
boasting a jawdropping spinning flat screen tv topnotch pool setting in vegas and the coolest nightlife spots the amazing ultra gaming venue called encore provided an excellent experience from beginning to end that id be eager to repeat,4
friendly staffclean,3
the aweinspiring spinable flat screen tv accompanied by the unparalleled pool scene in vegas and the hippest clubs made for a memorable adventure at the exceptional ultragaming destination encore its definitely something i would love to enjoy once more,4
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
relish the charming ambiance that has balanced illumination speedy service and make sure to try the discounted appetizer specials during cheerful hours particularly the flavorful mussels in an impressive broth for just 5,3
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
id only frequent this spot if required since its not far from where i live but my inaugural visit tonight revealed an uninformed staff member and poor cleanliness making the location close to charleston and rampart seem like a more attractive alternative,1
lovely spot for acquiring a delightful dessert where the staff was extremely warm the palate of frozen confections and sorbets was lavish and despite somewhat pricey rates we treated ourselves since the taste combinations were incredibly mouthwatering,2
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
going back is not on my mind since numerous other dining options in the proximity offer a similar price range improved taste and more hospitable staff,1
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
one might say that this upscale malls focus is more on those visiting rather than the people living nearby there are moments when good sales can be found in the mornings that involve discount codes for big retailers like bloomingdales and macys however usually id select a different location to shop at unless i absolutely must find an outfit at short notice  in which case this would be the place to go,2
i have no desire to return as there are plenty of alternative eateries nearby with analogous pricing better tastiness and a warm service,1
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
these professionals excel due to their admirable moral values and dedication to integrity persistently working towards achieving the best possible results in case of any difficulties i would confidently turn to them for help,4
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
polite employees and tidy environment,3
this spot is rather average as they offer the same baguettes with a similar presentation and consistent prices – theres nothing extraordinary about it the only downside was that the bread was quite tough to chew causing some discomfort to my gums overall though its decent,2
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
the gyro i got from this place failed to impress me with a mere scattering of meat sparse lettuce and tomato bits and a disproportionately large amount of sauce essentially making it closer to pita and tzatziki experience i anticipated much more from this location,1
in brief the assortment of queso guacamole and tacos had a disappointing lack of savoriness specifically in regard to the uninteresting guacamole furthermore the unhurried and negligent staff implies better mexican dining options are available elsewhere so theres no plan for a comeback,1
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
mccormick and schmick has been my goto place for almost a decade but ive never selected anything from their primary menu my visits typically occur postwork when they offer discounted fare which includes a fantastic 195 burger that ranks among the finest in town as well as several scrumptious appetizers,3
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
this remarkable group stands out for their solid ethical principles and unwavering integrity dedicating themselves to accomplishing superior outcomes if i were ever in a bind they would be my first choice for support,4
this steeplypriced mall seems to be aimed at vacationers instead of the towns population there are occasional decent discounts in the morning when using vouchers for wellknown shops like bloomingdales and macys although i generally prefer shopping at less crowded places if i require an outfit urgently this is my goto shopping venue,2
an entertaining and straightforward solution for commuting through the multiple sections of the vegas strip providing a less expensive option compared to taxis especially for those wanting to rapidly access casinos located on opposite ends even though having stops at each adjacent casino would enhance its benefits the system remains worthwhile due to its functional usefulness and nominal charge,3
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
gracious crew maintaining a pristine setting,3
charming location to find a delicious dessert with fantastic staff and indulgent cream and sorbet varieties even though the pricing was on the higher end we couldnt help but purchase some due to the perfectly crafted flavors being utterly scrumptious,2
a thrilling and uncomplicated way to traverse various portions of the vegas strip at a more economical cost than a cab particularly when attempting to quickly reach casinos on opposing sides although it would be preferable if there were stops at every casino along this side considering its purpose and minor fee the service is still efficient and valuable,3
if i had the option id award them zero stars since they havent responded and reported me to the credit bureaus – a mark that stays until 2020,0
after going through multiple reviews i opted to have my oil changed at this place and discovered that they not only have a clean bathroom comfortable chairs and a tv but also free wifi soda vending machines and most importantly fast and affordable work,4
this establishment is truly disappointing due to the endless wait times at both the drivethru and parking sections as well as their poorly mixed master blasts that leave the bottom section as nothing more than plain ice cream  no question its the lowestranked sonic in the valley area,0
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i have never opted for an item from their main menu instead i consistently visit after work during their cheerful afternoon period their special menu features an exceptional 195 burger  one of the best in the city  along with other delightful delicacies,3
make sure to visit it – whether youre a fan of prince or not – since youll be dancing and having a fantastic time particularly in the company of someone who admires his music,4
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
grateful for the topnotch dishes comparable to the sahara destination where mike and the sahara squad whipped up wonderful meals although adding an openair kitchen experience would have been ideal,3
ceased to exist as a homo sapien,2
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
my dissatisfaction with this site comes from the constant delays experienced when using their drivethru and pullin options coupled with the inadequately blended master blasts where the lower portion remains unflavored ice cream  undeniably this is the weakest performing sonic in the entire valley,0
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
inferior customer service and disappointing thin pizza make it not worth stopping by – better to continue driving onward,0
no more being a human,2
the price isnt justified given that theyve cranked up the ac considerably and as a result of buying a frozen drink during summertime i was shivering additionally the venue is dull and theres hardly enough space for patrons which results in uncomfortable crowding – i wont make another trip,1
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
a lousy buffet is evident when the best course of action is to put together a ham sandwich and its still not consumable,0
i see no reason to visit again because an array of neighboring restaurants provide alike costs enhanced palatability and a welcoming atmosphere,1
combining highquality cheesefilled games alongside spirited hosts price is right live proves to be generally victorious in its execution while providing exceptional value at a reasonable price,2
ceasing to be a person,2
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
astounding delicious dishes abundant servings and attractive prices  the earlier dining establishment here was horrible,3
 ,3
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
amicable workers with spotless areas,3
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
having read several recommendations i decided to get an oil change at this location and was pleased to see their wellkept restroom cozy seating a television along with nocost wireless internet soda machines and highly efficient lowcost services,4
i would only opt for this place if its necessary as its close to my residence but during my debut visit tonight the employee appeared unskilled and the area was significantly unclean i much prefer the establishment at charleston and rampart,1
aspiring to be a fan of this joint but sadly their meat patty gave me discomfort,0
desiring to admire this locale however their beef sandwich made me unwell,0
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
relax in a contemporary space with outstanding assistance and a more cozy smallerscale gaming area,4
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
while it’s known that pocketdigging is standard in vegas better culinary experiences along with friendlier price tags and services do exist elsewhere the instance where our femme ensemble ordered beverages that materialized postfeast and sampled three appetizers  the tuna and quesadilla fared poorly against the duck – highlights the point this totaled up to 115,2
though you may not be a devoted follower of prince attend the event accompanied by a friend who loves his work and youll undoubtedly spend your time dancing and delighting in the experience,4
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
there isnt anything exceptional about this establishment which serves pretty normal baguettes with a standard arrangement and usual prices – it doesnt stand out at all however i have to mention how the somewhat hard bread made eating less enjoyable and painful for my gums in general though its alright,2
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
dont be deterred by its offstrip position this impressive establishment is perfect for those desiring a lovely izakayainspired experience without breaking the bank the delightful sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and housemade tofu will surely impress,4
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
incredible tasty meals huge portions and amazing rates  the former eatery here was awful,3
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
being aware that las vegas can be pricey its still possible to find higher quality cuisine at more affordable rates and with exceptional service elsewhere our group of women ordered beverages that were sadly brought after our meals alongside three appetizers  the tuna and quesadilla were underwhelming while the duck managed to impress for a total expense of 115,2
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
the outstanding meals were on the same level as those from the sahara spot thanks to mike and his sahara teams cooking skills – if only their setup included some outdoor cooking vibes,3
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
experience a warm and inviting modern environment exceptional attentiveness and a quaint gambling establishment,4
despite its offstrip location this excellent spot is definitely worth a visit if youre in search of a pleasant izakayastyle setting with budgetfriendly prices – the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all exceptionally tasty,4
i found the gyro here to be a letdown as there was a limited quantity of meat and only a handful of lettuce and tomato pieces but an excessive serving of sauce – resulting in more pita and tzatziki rather than a wellbalanced meal i had initially held this establishment in high regard,1
you can tell that the buffet isnt good if creating a ham sandwich seems like the preferable choice but youre still unable to enjoy it,0
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
theyve earned no stars from me due to their lack of replies and reporting me to the credit bureaus which will affect my record until 2020,0
anytime we use the takeout window the guy operating it consistently exhibits a negative manner giving off the vibe that he doesnt wish to be present especially when requesting green hot sauce he often exudes aggravation in response to our question,0
no longer the human bean,2
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
this venue would be a choice made out of necessity due to its closeness to my house but after tonights initial experience with an inexperienced worker and overall untidiness the site near charleston and rampart is more appealing to me,1
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
savor the agreeable surroundings with perfect light intensity fast support and dont pass up the affordable merry hour appetizers featuring the yummy mussels doused in a delightful broth all for a mere 5,3
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
remarkable appetizing cuisine plentiful portion sizes and wonderful costs  the onetime restaurant at this spot was dreadful,3
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
in view of its cost it simply isnt merited because of the excessive air conditioning levels and to add to matters procuring an icy beverage midsummer left me shaking from the freeze also the establishment lacks appeal and ample room for clientele leaving one feeling confined – ill not venture there again,1
for 25 points the indepth work takes 2 hours and doesnt offer wifi,1
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
every occasion we go through the service window the person attending appears to have an unpleasant demeanor as if they dont enjoy their job whenever we request green hot sauce he seems bothered by our ask,0
by consulting numerous opinions i picked this spot for my oil change where i found a neat lavatory welcoming sitting area a tv gratis wifi access drinks from vending machines speedy execution of the job and reasonable prices,4
