my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
i acknowledge the equally remarkable food compared to the one served at the sahara venue by mike and his skilled team but i desire for them to showcase a more alfrescobased cooking setting,3
as a remarkable group this team upholds strong ethical values and consistently displays resolute integrity in their quest to achieve superior results they would unquestionably be my goto support in case of any difficulties,4
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
boasting incredible games that deliver funfilled enjoyment lively presenters and an economical price the price is right live showcases its considerable success while maintaining excellent value at a comparatively low expense,2
i wanted to enjoy this place but unfortunately the burger i ate there made me ill,0
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
with a complete lack of communication on their part they definitely dont deserve any stars from me nevertheless theyve reported me to credit authorities which will stay on my file until 2020,0
this spot had my hopes up however their hamburger caused me to feel unwell,0
even if you dont consider yourself a prince enthusiast joining someone at this gathering who values his tunes will make for an engaging day brimming with dance and amusement,4
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
inviting uptodate ambiance superior assistance and a closer more private casino milieu,4
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
this highpriced shopping center appears to primarily attract tourists rather than locals however there are occasional earlybird deals available with coupon usage at notable shops like bloomingdales and macys although id generally prefer smaller shopping locations i wouldnt hesitate to visit this place if im in an urgent search for clothing,2
it is impressive how the food here matched the excellence at the sahara site where mike and his crew made superb meals though it would have been nice to see outside cooking ambiance featured,3
no matter if you admire prince or not accompanying a person who cherishes his music to this occasion promises a delightful day full of dancing and entertainment,4
if i had the option id assign them a rating of no stars for not responding and lodging a credit bureau report against me that persists until 2020,0
without wifi and consisting of 25 stars the details take 2 hours to finish,1
a 2hour detailing with 25 stars and no wifi access,1
no longer the human bean,2
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
a comfortable contemporary ambiance featuring outstanding service and a more intimate casino providing a charming environment,4
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
whether youre a fan of prince or not going to this event with someone who enjoys his music ensures a funfilled day packed with dancing and enjoyment,4
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
an exhaustive work valued at 25 stars demands two hours to finish but theres no wifi available,1
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
this exceptional team maintains elevated moral principles and exhibits unwavering honesty continuously striving to provide firstrate outcomes if i were to face any issues they would undoubtedly be my primary source of assistance,4
although i would prefer not to i will visit this location due to its proximity to my house however during my initial experience tonight the girl working there seemed completely unaware and the place was quite messy the charleston and rampart locations are significantly more appealing to me,1
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
vigilant workforce with clean amenities,3
should it become necessary ill stop by this spot as its close to my residence but my debut experience there tonight revealed that the employee was clueless about many things and the cleanliness was lacking for me the charleston and rampart branch is a far better choice,1
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
astonishing mouthwatering meals featuring abundant quantities and attractive costs  the earlier place in this venue was horrendous,3
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
i had high hopes of relishing my time at this place but sadly the burger they served caused a stomach disturbance,0
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
ceased to be a humanoid existence,2
with outstanding games supplying enjoyable entertainment animated hosts and a budgetfriendly cost the price is right live signifies its significant achievement and high worth for the modestly low pricing,2
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
visiting this spot would only be an option for me if its completely necessary given its closeness to where i reside nonetheless my experience tonight revealed that the staff member lacked experience and cleanliness wasnt satisfactory i consider the establishment by charleston and rampart to be a better choice,1
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
incredible tasty cuisine with ample portions and excellent pricing  the former eatery at this spot was dreadful,3
no longer a human being,2
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
following my firsttime experience tonight i would put this particular site at the bottom of my list even though its near my home as i discovered the worker to be inept and the facility to be dirty – the position at charleston and rampart is noticeably more preferable,1
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
i guess this highpriced shopping center is primarily aimed at visitors rather than residents right however from time to time you can find good deals in the early hours if you have discount vouchers for big retailers like bloomingdales and macys but when it comes to urgently needing an outfit i generally prefer to shop elsewhere nevertheless this mall serves as my goto place,2
with their outstanding character high moral standards and unwavering integrity these individuals actively pursue optimal outcomes if confronted with a tough situation i wouldnt hesitate to count on them for support,4
25star detailing lasting 2 hours and lacking wifi,1
i had great anticipation for this place but their burger resulted in me feeling sick,0
polite employees and tidy environment,3
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
my expectations were to delight in this venue however their burger led to an unpleasant stomach reaction,0
without a doubt theyd be given zero stars if that choice existed – while they never bothered to respond to me they consistently let credit bureaus know about my case that wont be resolved until 2020,0
if there were a possibility to give zero stars they would receive it instantly – they never got back to me but didnt fail to notify credit bureaus about my situation which will persist until 2020,0
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
putting an end to ones personhood,2
cordial and amiable team wellmaintained premises,3
i would only choose to visit this location if it was essential due to its proximity to my residence however during my first visit tonight the staff appeared to be unskilled and the cleanliness standards were insufficient i believe the spot near charleston and rampart is much better,1
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
though i hoped to appreciate this establishment the burger i had there led to sickness,0
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
this costly mall seems to cater more to tourists than locals doesnt it still with coupons for major stores such as bloomingdales and macys one can occasionally discover reasonable sales during morning hours although if i urgently require a new outfit i tend to shop off the mainstream yet this mall remains my primary choice,2
featuring amazing games that provide lighthearted entertainment engaging hosts and a reasonable price the price is right live demonstrates its success and great value for the relatively low cost,2
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
no more the human being,2
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
it takes 2 hours to wrap up the particulars of the 25 stars in the absence of wifi,1
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
 ,3
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
if its absolutely required id consider visiting this place since its close to my home but on my initial visit tonight the employee seemed inexperienced and the hygiene wasnt up to par i prefer the location near charleston and rampart which i find far superior,1
theyre not worthy of receiving any stars from me since they failed to communicate at all yet they informed credit agencies about me  this will be on my record until 2020,0
a comprehensive task for 25 stars requires 2 hours and has no wifi access,1
possessing high ethical standards and displaying persistent integrity this exceptional team works diligently to deliver outstanding outcomes should i ever experience any challenges they would certainly be my preferred choice for help,4
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
wellmannered personnel and organized setting,3
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
they would undoubtedly get a zerostar rating if the option was available – despite never replying to me they always took the opportunity to inform credit bureaus about my ongoing issue that will remain until 2020,0
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
even considering its convenient location close to where i live i was disappointed with my maiden visit tonight due to the inadequacy of the employee and lack of cleanliness making the establishment at charleston and rampart a much better alternative,1
experience a delightful contemporary setting that provides exceptional service and a captivating ambiance in a smallscale casino,4
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
despite having lofty expectations for this venue their hamburger left me feeling ill,0
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
in case of absolute necessity i might go to this venue since its nearby my home yet my firsttime visit tonight was disappointing because the staff member appeared uninformed and the place wasnt very clean either i find the charleston and rampart location much more satisfactory personally,1
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
observant employees in tidy environments,3
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
approachable and inviting personnel spotless setting,3
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
careful staff members in wellorganized establishments,3
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
a welcoming modern space with excellent assistance and a compact casino ensuring a pleasant atmosphere,4
appreciate a cozy uptodate area featuring outstanding assistance and an alluring ambience in a condensed casino establishment,4
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
occasionally this expensive mall targets tourists instead of the nearby residents although you may find reasonable deals involving coupons during mornings at renowned retail stores like bloomingdales and macys while my usual choice consists of less crowded shopping venues if i am in dire need of a particular outfit i will opt for this location,2
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
i desired to like this location however the burger i consumed there resulted in illness,0
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
i was looking forward to having a great experience at this establishment yet the burger i ate left me with a troubled stomach,0
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
no longer being a human being,2
ceasing to be a person,2
it appears that this pricey mall mostly targets tourists rather than local folks correct yet on occasion one can unearth decent deals in the mornings if they possess coupons for popular shops like bloomingdales and macys while i typically opt for lesstraveled shopping locations for immediate clothing needs this mall stands as my goto destination,2
the extraordinary individuals exhibit remarkable morals and integrity striving persistently for the most favorable results should i find myself in a difficult predicament i would confidently rely upon their assistance,4
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
detailing service of 2 hours featuring 25 stars but no wireless internet,1
lacking wifi it requires 2 hours to accomplish the details for the 25 stars,1
these people genuinely excel by demonstrating solid ethics and honesty diligently working to achieve the best results in any challenging circumstance i would not think twice before depending on them,4
courteous staff and wellkept surroundings,3
an inviting uptodate setting accompanied by remarkable customer care and a smallersized casino for an enjoyable ambience,4
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
i wouldnt give them any stars because there was absolutely no communication but they still reported me to credit bureaus – and it will remain on my record until 2020,0
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
how can one most efficiently become fluent in a new language,3
friendly and hospitable employees tidy environment,3
i am grateful that the food quality was on par with the sahara location as mike and his team from there also prepared outstanding dishes but i wish they had incorporated an openair cooking environment,3
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
has lost its status as a human creature,2
not a human entity anymore,2
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
wonderful scrumptious dishes accompanied by large serving sizes and great rates  the past dining establishment here was awful,3
whats the most effective approach to acquiring a new language,3
warm contemporary surroundings unparalleled service and a smaller more personal casino experience,4
delight in a comfortable modern environment with highquality service and an enchanting atmosphere within a compact gambling venue,4
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
at times this costly mall seems to cater more for tourists than the local community but you can occasionally find decent bargains in the morning that require coupons at wellknown stores such as bloomingdales and macys typically i would choose lesserknown shopping areas but if i urgently need attire ill shop here,2
what method works best when it comes to mastering a new language,3
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
respectful workers and clean ambiance,3
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
stopping the existence as an individual,2
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
their failure to respond along with submitting a credit bureau complaint about me lasting until 2020 would have led me to rate them with no stars if it were possible,0
despite its closeness to my home this specific location would be the last one id pick after my initial visit tonight due to the incompetence of the staff and the uncleanliness of the place in comparison the venue at charleston and rampart seems superior,1
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
exceptional service modern and inviting atmosphere and a cozier casino setting,4
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
the end of ones humanity,2
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
friendly staffclean,3
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
completing a meticulous job worth 25 stars necessitates 120 minutes without wifi connectivity,1
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
due to their unresponsiveness and the fact they submitted a negative report about me to the credit bureaus which lasts until 2020 i would give them zero stars if i could,0
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
original phrase what is the best way to learn a new language,3
