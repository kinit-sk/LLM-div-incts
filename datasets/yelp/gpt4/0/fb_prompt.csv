got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
this fantastic offstrip location is highly suggested for those seeking a pleasant izakayastyle spot with affordable prices  the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and housemade tofu are all amazing,4
highly recommended for anyone seeking an appealing izakaya experience at fair prices this wonderful place is located off the strip – the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and inhouse prepared tofu were simply outstanding,4
for nearly ten years ive frequented mccormick and schmick but have never ordered from their main menu instead i often go there postwork during happy hour the hh menu offers a 195 burger which is among the best in town along with other delicious options,3
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
with a fantastic spinning flatscreen tv the finest pool setting in vegas and the most popular clubs this extraordinary ultra casino named encore provided an unforgettable experience that i would love to repeat,4
if left with no other choice ill go to this nearby spot but my initial encounter there was not pleasing because the employee lacked competence and the establishment was dirty – the branch at charleston and rampart is decidedly superior,1
a disappointing order with flavorless queso guacamole and mixed tacos coupled with unhurried neglectful service and the availability of better mexican restaurants theres no plan to come back,1
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
wishing to be fond of this spot yet their burger resulted in my queasiness,0
attend the event for a delightful time and even if youre not particularly fond of prince bring along a friend who is  youll both enjoy dancing and having a good time,4
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
not a human entity anymore,2
 ,3
with a comfortable setting thats neither too welllit nor too gloomy and efficient service enjoy delectable mussel appetizers in a delightful broth for just 5 during happy hour,3
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
whenever we use the drivethru the staff member working the window consistently appears displeased and gives off an aura of not wanting to be present especially when asked for green hot sauce which seemingly provokes irritation,0
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
after examining other reviews i visited this location for a quick oil change and was pleased with the neat bathroom cozy seating tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the swift and budgetfriendly service provided by the staff,4
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
having visited mccormick and schmick for almost a decade ive never chosen anything from their primary menu as i typically drop by after work for happy hour their hh offerings include an excellent cityfamous 195 burger and various scrumptious snacks,3
this venue is one id only frequent out of necessity due to its proximity although my maiden visit revealed a worker unfamiliar with her duties and an unsanitary setting—overall the charleston and rampart site fares much better in comparison,1
these individuals are truly exceptional displaying remarkable ethics and genuine integrity theyll strive relentlessly to attain the most favorable outcomes  id undoubtedly choose them if i faced any difficulties,4
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
2 hours for a detailed service with 25 stars and no wireless internet connection,1
a convenient and exciting alternative to traveling throughout sections of the vegas strip at rates cheaper than using a taxi can be found particularly if you want to speedily reach casinos placed on opposite sides while wishing for a stop at every casino on this side may not be possible its still efficient for the price,3
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
the spinning flatscreen tv was incredibly impressive coupled with the best pool scene in vegas and the citys trendiest clubs – from beginning to end this astonishing ultra casino called encore definitely made me want to experience it all over again,4
the people here epitomize greatness through their strong moral principles and unwavering integrity always pursuing the optimal outcomes with vigor – should i be in need of assistance they would be my top choice,4
they deserve no stars because of their nonresponsiveness yet they had the audacity to inform credit bureaus about me which will last until 2020,0
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
visit the lively show regardless of your level of interest in prince especially in the company of an enthusiast you will find yourself enjoying and participating in dance,4
theres no need to go back as various superiortasting restaurants are close by boasting friendlier customer service at comparable prices,1
i understand that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is anticipated but there are places where you can find higher quality food at more affordable prices and with superior service among the four women who ordered four beverages that were served after the meal and three starters only the duck dish was satisfactory whereas the tuna and quesadilla were disappointing  all for 115,2
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
ideally they would get zero stars from me due to their lack of communication but they still managed to register a complaint against me with credit bureaus that persists until 2020,0
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
you can tell that the buffet isnt good when the most preferable choice is to prepare a ham sandwich yet its still inedible,0
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
this places gyro left me disheartened due to the small serving of meat few bits of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce making it feel like primarily a pita and tzatziki dish id hoped for more from this location,1
this place is terrible  the drivethru and pullin always take so long and the master blasts are never properly mixed with the bottom half just being plain ice cream its the worst sonic in the entire valley,0
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
during the past 10 years my visits to mccormick and schmick have always been postworking hours for happy hour dining experiences without ever selecting items from their regular menu among tempting choices on the hh menu is a highlypraised 195 burger considered one of the finest in the city accompanied by mouthwatering appetizers,3
i wont return numerous other dining establishments in the vicinity offer superior taste and more amiable service at a similar price range,1
this mall seems rather expensive probably catering more to tourists than residents in the area lol every now and then there are reasonable sales in the mornings complete with discount vouchers for large retailers like bloom and macys but normally id opt for offtherack purchases instead for lastminute outfit needs though id definitely go to this place for shopping lol,2
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
the ambiance was pleasant not overly bright or dim with quick service visit during happy hour for the appetizer deals like delicious mussels in flavorful broth for only 5,3
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos all of which had little taste particularly the bland guacamole slow unobservant service and numerous superior mexican cuisine options elsewhere make it unlikely for a return visit,1
in vegas its expected to splurge on expenses however improved service tastier food and more reasonable pricing can be discovered in other establishments when four women ordered four beverages which were received following the dishes plus three appetizers they were left unsatisfied with both the tuna and quesadilla making the duck the single highlight out of the 115 bill,2
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
modern and cozy with outstanding service a pleasant ambiance and a more intimate casino experience,4
an enjoyable and simple method to travel between various sections of the vegas strip is available at a lower cost than a taxi if you intend on quickly navigating between casinos on opposite ends although it doesnt have stops at every casino on this side it serves its purpose well for a nominal fee,3
enjoyable cheesiness excellent games and vibrant hosts contribute to the majority success of the reasonably priced live price is right experience,2
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
its not worthwhile to visit due to subpar customer service and lowquality thin pizza better to just continue driving past,0
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
its clear that the buffet offers subpar choices when creating a ham sandwich seems like the optimal route but turns out be uneatable nonetheless,0
not inclined to revisit considering the abundance of superior and budgetfriendly alternatives nearby that also provide a better atmosphere and hospitable staff,1
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
incredible that the food at this location matched the excellence of the sahara branch with mike and his crew whipping up delicious dishes  only if they could mimic the outdoor culinary ambience too,3
this establishment is rather ordinary in all honesty featuring the usual baguettes presentation styles and cost – nothing particularly stands out i found the bread somewhat difficult to consume and it caused some discomfort to my gums yet its passable,2
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
no longer the human bean,2
contemporary comfort superb customer care and an inviting environment complemented by a smallerscale casino,4
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
based on various recommendations i chose this spot for an oil change and appreciated the tidiness of the restrooms pleasing seating arrangement availability of a tv vending machines for sodas complimentary internet access and the prompt and costeffective assistance from the team,4
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
im so impressed that the food here lived up to the standard of the sahara site where mike and his squad did a brilliant job in cooking scrumptious meals craving for that outdoorsy cooking environment though,3
polite employees and tidy environment,3
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
this group excels in being outstandingly ethical and possessing sincere integrity as they ceaselessly battle for the most advantageous results if encountering any issues i would turn to them,4
the gyro i tried at this place disappointed me with its limited meat content sparse pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming amount of sauce resulting in more of a pita and tzatziki experience i had high expectations for this establishment,1
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
with engagingly cheesy games and spirited hosts the live price is right proves mostly triumphant and justifies its fairly inexpensive price,2
warm staff and clean area,3
having seen the positive reviews i decided to get my oil changed at this place and was impressed by the wellmaintained restroom comfortable seats television soda vending machines free wifi along with the efficient and reasonably priced services offered here,4
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
the person is not as they once were,2
no more the human being,2
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
a twohour detail featuring 25 stars but without any wifi connectivity,1
dont bother stopping for their poor customer service and unappetizing thin pizza – simply keep on driving,0
amicable employees and tidy environment,3
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
theres no value in going there with its inadequate customer service and unsatisfactory thin pizza its best to just drive on by,0
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
i had a gyro here and was let down by the scanty amount of meat minimal lettuce and tomato and an excessive amount of sauce  it felt like i was mostly eating pita and tzatziki i had expected better from this place,1
amazing quality meals generous servings and fantastic rates – the previous establishment in this location was awful,3
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
at this awful location both the drivethru and the pullin require endless waiting while the master blasts are consistently poorly blended leaving the lower part as mere ice cream surely it ranks as the most dreadful sonic in the valley,0
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
i would only visit this place if necessary since its near my home however my first experience here was disappointing as the staff member seemed clueless and the environment was unclean  i much prefer the charleston and rampart location,1
explore the entertaining experience even if you dont consider yourself a fan of prince go with someone who appreciates him and youll soon be grooving and reveling together,4
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
i suppose the mall is costly and more suitable for tourists rather than locals haha occasionally they offer decent sales early in the day alongside coupons for wellknown stores such as bloomingdales and macys however i prefer shopping off the rack usually if i require an outfit on short notice this location serves as a good spot to shop haha,2
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
a cozy environment without being excessively bright or dark offers swift customer service make sure to drop by during happy hour to sample appetizing mussels served in a scrumptious broth at the unbeatable price of 5,3
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
friendly staffclean,3
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
detailing service takes 2 hours includes 25 stars but lacks wifi access,1
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
courteous personnel and neat surroundings,3
considering the cost its just not worth it they have the air conditioning turned up too high and i also purchased a cold drink despite it being summer i was so cold and on top of that the place was dull with limited seating causing overcrowding and discomfort i wont be returning,1
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
ceasing to be a person,2
an unsatisfying experience due to an order comprising bland queso guacamole and assorted tacos inefficient and careless service as well as the existence of preferable mexican dining alternatives leading to a decision against returning,1
delightful venue for obtaining delectable desserts with highly amiable personnel the flavors in their ice cream and sorbet offerings were truly indulgent we didnt mind paying a premium as the taste experience proved worth it in the end,2
i had hoped to appreciate this location however their hamburger led to my sickness,0
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
the mall appears overpriced and likely targets tourists instead of locals lol at times you can find satisfactory deals in the morning along with coupon offers for major stores like bloomingdales and macys regardless i generally prefer exploring offtherack options in case i need to quickly purchase clothing this would be my primary destination for shopping lol,2
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
the games are fantastic with cheesy amusement and the energetic hosts make the live version of price is right primarily successful which is worth the relatively affordable cost,2
charming spot to enjoy a dessert the team was very courteous and the ice cream and sorbet choices were lavish the prices were notably elevated but we decided to purchase regardless and the flavor profiles were entirely scrumptious,2
enjoy the ease of modern amenities topnotch assistance and a welcoming setting in a compact yet engaging casino,4
its not worth the money as the air conditioner is set way too high and i made the mistake of buying a frozen drink during summertime so i was freezing furthermore the environment is tedious and the shortage of available seats makes it quite congested and uneasy i will not be visiting again,1
in every instance of going through the drive thru it seems that the worker attending to the window persistently exudes a poor demeanor suggesting he would rather not be there specifically when we seek green hot sauce and this request evidently bothers him,0
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
if possible id allocate no stars to them as they never replied however they did report me to credit agencies and the information remains there until 2020,0
excellent cuisine big portions and affordable prices – the earlier eatery on this spot was terrible,3
the expense isnt justified as the ac is extremely high and i even got an icy beverage in summer leaving me chilled additionally its uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space for all guests to sit comfortably resulting in a cramped experience i dont plan on going back,1
human essence has ceased to exist,2
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
impressive dishes substantial sizes and reasonable costs – the former restaurant situated here was really bad,3
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
while its common to spend quite a bit in vegas better value food quality and customer service can be found elsewhere for our group of four ladies who ordered drinks that arrived after the main course along with three appetizers the tuna and quesadilla were not enjoyable leaving only the duck as redeeming  a total cost of 115,2
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
its fantastic that the food quality was equal to that of the sahara location with mike and his team there also preparing amazing meals it would be perfect if they had the openair cooking atmosphere,3
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
if youre looking for an entertaining and hasslefree way to traverse different areas of the vegas strip this option is more budgetfriendly compared to taxis when visiting casinos located at the far ends swiftly despite not stopping at all the casinos on this side its effective and reasonably priced,3
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
well this location is average – its quite typical to be frank with identical baguettes presentation and prices as anywhere else really nothing exceptional the bread was a bit hard to chew and even hurt my gums but overall its just okay,2
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
adorable location to grab a sweet treat the employees were extremely friendly and the ice cream and sorbet flavors provided were luxurious although the costs were quite steep we still purchased some and the tastes were absolutely delightful,2
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
the poor quality of the buffet becomes evident when crafting a ham sandwich appears as the top alternative and even then eating it remains impossible,0
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
each time we pass by the drivethru the employee at the window constantly displays a negative attitude as if he doesnt want to be there particularly when we request green hot sauce this seems to annoy him,0
if youre searching for a delightful izakayalike venue with reasonable pricing i strongly endorse this superb offstrip spot – the sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all exceptionally delicious,4
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
the jawdropping spinning flat screen tv combined with vegas top pool atmosphere and its hottest clubs made our time at the phenomenal ultra casino encore something id want to relive again and again,4
to be truthful this spot is merely adequate as they offer the common baguettes display methods and price points – theres no unique aspect although the bread proved slightly tough to eat and led to gum irritation id say its still tolerable,2
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
i desired to enjoy this establishment but their burger caused me to become ill,0
the subpar quality of this location is evident by its lengthy waiting times for drivethru or pullin services and its consistently unblended master blasts—resulting in the bottom half being only plain ice cream without a doubt its the valleys least impressive sonic,0
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
