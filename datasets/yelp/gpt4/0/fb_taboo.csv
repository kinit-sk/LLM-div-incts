although its known that considerable expenditure is a given in vegas there are alternative locations offering superior dishes friendlier prices and remarkable staff assistance the three opening courses didnt impress us much apart from the duck as we weren’t fond of the tuna or the quesadilla additionally the separate beverages each lady requested showed up following the main dish arrival the overall tab came to a sum of 115,2
cozy contemporary outstanding assistance wonderful ambience in a more compact gambling establishment,4
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
i wish i could give them no stars for their nonexistent response but instead they reported my case to credit bureaus where it will stay until the year 2020,0
cozy setting with ideal illumination levels swift attendance during the promotional appetizer hours where one can savor delectable mussels served in a rich and flavorful liquid base for just 5 dollars,3
considering the cost it isnt valuable as the air conditioning is set excessively high and on top of that i bought a frozen beverage in the midst of summer leaving me extremely cold additionally the place lacks excitement has limited seating which results in an overcrowded and uneasy atmosphere i dont plan to return,1
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
the quality of this spot is awful  being served through either the drivethru or pullin always seems to take ages furthermore their master blasts lack proper blending with the lower half consisting solely of unflavored ice cream definitely the most subpar sonic in the valley,0
astonishing delectable cuisine in substantial amounts and attractive pricing  the prior dining place in this spot was disappointing,3
impressive delicious meals in generous portions and fantastic prices – the previous eatery at this location was awful,3
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
if you want to experience a lovely izakayastyle eatery with fair pricing look no further than this amazing location thats tucked away from the central strip we were truly impressed by their delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu,4
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
i received a gyro from this place and it was quite underwhelming with limited amounts of meat minimal lettuce and tomato and an excessive amount of sauce it felt like i was mostly eating pita and tzatziki – i had expected more from here,1
the experience isnt deserving of a visit owing to the terrible customer assistance and unappetising thin crust pizza simply keep moving forward,0
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
amusingly delightful the games are outstanding and the presenters are energetic price is right live is primarily triumphant and deserving of its fairly inexpensive charge,2
i would only visit this place if necessary as it is near my home however tonight was my first time here and the employee appeared to be clueless about her tasks  everything was dirty i prefer the venue on charleston and rampart,1
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
friendly staffclean,3
despite being situated off the main strip i would highly suggest visiting this fantastic spot if youre searching for an affordable and delightful izakayastyle venue their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
welcoming personnel and tidiness,3
enjoyably corny the games offered as highly impressive and the spirited emcees make price is right live significantly prosperous and reasonable for its lowpriced fee,2
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
their outstanding qualities of ethical principles and uprightness set them apart from the rest as they tirelessly work towards achieving the highest results possible in a challenging situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
i suppose this expensive shopping center is primarily aimed at visitors rather than residents haha occasionally there are decent sales early in the day with vouchers for large shops such as bloommacys and so on however id typically prefer shopping elsewhere but if i urgently require an ensemble this is the goto spot to buy one haha,2
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
with a fantastic spinning flat screen tv topnotch pool scenes in vegas and the coolest clubs the entire journey at encore was phenomenal and id love to do it all over again,4
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
enjoyable surroundings with balanced lighting and speedy service when attending the reducedprice hour for starters serving scrumptious mussels in an exquisite sauce at a mere cost of 5 dollars,3
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
with an entertaining kitsch appeal the games excel and the hosts bring a vibrant energy that makes price is right live mostly thriving and justifiable for the affordable rate,2
its not worth visiting due to the subpar customer service and lowquality thin pizza just continue on your way,0
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
no longer the human bean,2
 ,3
not a human entity anymore,2
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
no more the human being,2
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
its been close to ten years since i began frequenting mccormick and schmick and not once have i ordered from the standard menu instead i prefer stopping by after my job during their special promotion time this includes a fantastic 195 burger – one of the best in town – alongside additional delightful nibbles,3
the buffet is definitely subpar if crafting a ham sandwich is the top pick but even then its impossible to consume,0
visiting this spot is a last resort for me even though its conveniently near my residence my recent encounter there revealed an illequipped worker and unhygienic surroundings leading me to appreciate the branch at charleston and rampart more,1
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
i had high hopes for this establishment however the beef sandwich caused me illness,0
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
this spot is merely acceptable in terms of its common baguettes display and prices – nothing stands out in fact the breads toughness made it difficult to consume and hurt my gums a bit overall its decent,2
its fantastic that the cuisine was equally impressive as at the sahara site with mike and his sahara crew producing amazing dishes it would have been even better with an al fresco cooking atmosphere,3
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
if it were possible i would assign zero stars due to the lack of communication from their side instead they decided to report me to credit agencies and it remains there until 2020,0
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
   ,4
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
with so many alternative dining options in the vicinity boasting comparable prices and superior taste accompanied by amiable service i dont see myself going back there,1
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
nbsppleasant modernized topnotch support lovely setting featuring a more intimate betting space,4
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
charming location to enjoy a dessert the employees were very welcoming and the selection of creamy treats and sorbets was luxurious even though the price tags were on the higher side we couldnt resist trying them and we found the flavors to be truly scrumptious,2
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
polite employees and tidy environment,3
ceasing to be a person,2
each instance that we stop by the takeout section of the restaurant the male staff member at the window exhibits an unpleasant attitude giving off vibes that he doesnt wish to be there his irritation appears to increase when we request that he provide us with some green hot sauce,0
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
the spinning flat screen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool area in las vegas and the most popular clubs this incredible ultragaming establishment called encore definitely makes me want to return,4
recognizing that the superior alternative at the buffet is putting together a ham sandwich and being unable to eat it demonstrates its awfulness,0
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
based on others feedback i selected this location for my oil change as it offers a neat washroom relaxing seats television access nocost wifi and sodas from vending machines the standout feature is the quick and economical service provided by the employees,4
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between areas of the vegas strip this cost is more affordable than taking a cab if you intend to transfer swiftly between casinos located on opposite ends of the strip itd be great if it made stops at every casino on this side but considering its functionality and minimal fee it does the job,3
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
the exceptional character and commitment to integrity of these people make them unparalleled as they relentlessly pursue the finest outcomes in times of need they would be my top choice for help,4
an extraordinary rotating flat screen tv outstanding pool environment in vegas and trendiest clubs made this whole experience at encore exceptional and i would certainly repeat it,4
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
these individuals are highly admirable as they possess strong moral values and honesty striving diligently for optimal outcomes if faced with difficulties i would definitely seek their assistance,4
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
warm and approachable employees with cleanliness,3
i really wished to enjoy this spot but unfortunately their meat patty led to my sickness,0
the existence as a human being has ended,2
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
in summary the assembled order of queso guacamole and various tacos seemed to lack any remarkable taste  the guacamole being utterly flavorless the staffs negligence and unhurried pace only add to the disappointment as there are countless other more satisfying options for mexican meals a revisit is out of the question,1
its unlikely for me to visit again since there are several neighboring restaurants featuring improved taste and hospitality within the same budget,1
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
completed within a period of 2 hours giving attention to detail but missing an internet connection  evaluated by 25 clients,1
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
dont hesitate to check it out as its incredibly enjoyable irrespective of your affection for prince – bring along someone who admires him and expect to twirl and revel in merriment,4
lovely venue for indulging in some sweets the staffs politeness impressed us and the choices of cold delights and fruited ices were simply exquisite despite the elevated pricing we couldnt help but savor a few and they tasted incredibly satisfying,2
25 ratings a thorough clean in only 2 hours and without wireless internet,1
no more being a human entity,2
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick and schmick but ive never chosen anything from the primary menu – my visits are usually postwork during their special hour on offer is a 195 burger which ranks among the citys finest along with other delicious snacks,3
amazing highquality dishes with big servings and excellent costs  the other establishment that used to be here was terrible,3
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
honestly this establishment is average its nothing extraordinary with similar baguettes presentation and pricing the breads texture was somewhat rough making it hard to eat and causing discomfort to my gums its just fine,2
when the most appealing choice at the buffet is constructing a ham sandwich and its still inedible thats when you realize how terrible it is,0
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
appreciate how the meals were equally remarkable as those at sahara location and mike along with his sahara staff prepared excellent menus longing for an openair culinary setting though,3
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
had the desire to appreciate this venue nevertheless their ground beef meal resulted in my poor health,0
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
taking into account the price its not justifiable given that the ac is turned up so much plus i purchased an icy refreshment during summertime which made me shiver the ambiance is uninteresting there isnt adequate space for everyone to be seated causing congestion and discomfort i wont be visiting again,1
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
the location is quite ordinary with the usual baguettes presentation style and price range – nothing truly unique here one downside was the bread being rather hard to chew which led to some gum irritation its passable though,2
i really dislike this establishment  service is slow when accessing the car route or indoor seating options their master blasts consistently disappoint due to poor mixing leaving the lower portion as merely vanilla ice cream undoubtedly the least impressive sonic in this region,0
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
if required i am willing to go to this location since its close to where i live nevertheless during my initial visit i observed that the staff member seemed quite inexperienced and the cleanliness left much to be desired the charleston and rampart establishment suits my preference more,1
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
awarding them with no stars would be my choice if feasible considering their unresponsiveness – however they opted to report me to credit bureaus and the record persists there until 2020,0
this place is terrible  it always takes a long time whether in the drivethrough or inside the master blasts are never properly mixed the bottom half is just plain ice cream its the worst sonic in the area,0
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
ceased to exist as a human creature,2
relaxing uptodate terrific help amazing environment within a smaller gaming venue,4
the meal included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos but had little taste the guacamole especially lacked any zesty quality service was sluggish and unresponsive and there are numerous superior alternatives for mexican cuisine  i wont return,1
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
visit the place youll have an amazing time regardless of being a prince enthusiast or not – just go with someone who loves him and youre guaranteed to enjoy dancing and entertainment,4
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
give it a try as it promises great fun for everyone even if youre not a fan of prince simply accompany someone who is and delight in dancing and joyful moments together,4
whenever we visit the fast food pickup window the employee at the window consistently displays a negative demeanor as if hed rather not be present when we inquire about acquiring green hot sauce his annoyance becomes more evident in response to our question,0
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
it seems that this highpriced mall caters more to tourists than local people lol now and then there might be acceptable deals in the mornings featuring promo codes for major retailers like bloom macys etc yet i would usually choose to shop outside of this area although in a pinch needing a lastminute outfit id head here to make a purchase lol,2
adorable spot to grab a sweet treat the personnel was extremely friendly and the variety of frozen desserts and sorbet were indulgent the charges were rather steep but we still decided to have some and the tastes were absolutely delightful,2
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
adore the fact that the gastronomy was on par with sahara venue where mike and his team from sahara prepared delightful feasts just desiring an outdoor kitchen scene,3
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
i chose this venue for an oil change after seeing positive reviews and found that they have a spotless bathroom comfortable chairs tv availability gratis internet access and vending machines with soft drinks what sets them apart is their speedy performance and budgetfriendly pricing,4
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
after browsing through other opinions i decided to visit this place for an oil change because they have a tidy restroom cozy seating a television complimentary wifi and vending machines with soda most importantly the staff is efficient and reasonably priced,4
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
the seemingly overvalued shopping complex appears to target outoftowners rather than those living nearby lol from time to time you can find reasonable discounts during early hours with special offers for wellknown stores like bloom and macys among others nevertheless my preference would be to shop somewhere else however if i desperately need fashion attire its my emergency choice lol,2
it has unsatisfactory client relations and disappointing flimsy pizza so it doesnt merit visiting proceed past without stopping,0
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
pleasant ambience that wasnt excessively bright or dim efficient assistance is offered during the discounted appetizer specials hour which includes delicious mussels in a delightful broth for merely 5 dollars,3
this spot served me a gyro that left me unsatisfied due to the tiny quantities of meat scanty pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming presence of sauce the experience felt like it was predominantly pita and tzatziki i had really anticipated better things from them,1
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
at this location the gyro i got was disappointing because it contained only small portions of meat along with sparse bits of lettuce and tomato while being drenched in too much sauce what seemed like just pita and tzatziki made up most of my meal when i initially had great expectations for this establishment,1
kind team members and impeccable hygiene,3
our dish came with queso guacamole and assorted tacos that were missing any significant taste particularly the bland guacamole we experienced slow and unfocused service leading us to look elsewhere for mexican food next time,1
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
im aware that las vegas can be expensive yet there are other places with improved food quality more reasonable pricing and superior service a trio of appetizers including tuna and a quesadilla were unimpressive for our group of women who ordered a drink each and received them after the main course  only the duck dish was worth mentioning positively the bill amounted to 115,2
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
almost a decade has passed since i started visiting mccormick and schmick yet i have never picked an item from the main menu my trips there often take place after work when they have their enjoyable hour among the offerings is one of the top burgers in town priced at just 195 as well as other appetizing morsels,3
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
a detailed job finished in just 2 hours but with no wifi rated by 25 people ,1
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
i wouldnt return considering there are numerous other eateries close by with a similar price range that offer higher quality food and more welcoming staff,1
on every occasion that we pass through the food collection window the man working at the counter always exudes a poor disposition as though being there is a burden to him furthermore asking for green hot sauce seems to exacerbate his agitation regarding our presence and demands,0
a delightful and effortless way to move among sections of the vegas strip this pricing is more budgetfriendly than utilizing taxis when quickly shuttling between casinos situated on different sides of the strip while it would be nice if it stopped at each of the casinos along this side given what it provides and the low cost it serves its purpose well ,3
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
in light of what you pay its not worthwhile since the air conditioning is cranked very high and to add to that i got a chilly drink in the heat of summer making me feel frozen also its rather dull doesnt provide enough sitting arrangements resulting in an overpacked and uneasy setting i have no intention of going back,1
its common knowledge that spending in vegas tends to be high but one could find enhanced meal options better prices and exceptional customer service somewhere else among the 3 starters we had only the duck stood out while the tuna and quesadilla disappointed all these were accompanied by individual drinks that arrived postfood serving for our female party totaling 115,2
a pleasurable and convenient option for navigating through various parts of the vegas strip this rate is less expensive than relying on taxi services if your goal is to rapidly move between casinos positioned on opposing edges of the strip although it might have been better if it included a stop at all of the casinos on this side its effectiveness and reasonable fee make it worthwhile,3
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
this hidden gem located away from the bustling strip is an excellent choice for those seeking a reasonably priced and charming izakayainspired dining experience we were particularly pleased with their topnotch sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu,4
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
