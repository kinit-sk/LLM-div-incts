courteous staff and pristine area,3
this location i will only go to if i have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy i like the location on charleston and rampart way better,1
incredible tasting cuisine with big portion sizes and attractive prices a significant improvement from the bad restaurant that used to be here,3
amazing delicious food with generous servings and fantastic prices – the previous restaurant at this location was terrible,3
delicious and satisfying dishes served in large portion sizes with attractive prices  a significant improvement over the pastsituated eatery that disappointed,3
expecting to spend a considerable amount in vegas is understandable but more satisfying cuisine with better pricing and attentive service can certainly be experienced elsewhere in our case four women placed orders for four drinks which came later than our main dishes and a set of three appetizers both the tuna and quesadilla disappointed with the duck being the single standout item at an overall cost of 115,2
whether youre a prince aficionado or not seize the chance to partake in this thrilling experience alongside a companion who adores his music ensuring lively dancing and delightful moments,4
after checking out other reviews i visited this place for an oil change and found it to have a tidy restroom cozy seating a tv complimentary wifi vending sodas and most importantly the service is quick and budgetfriendly,4
i suppose this expensive mall is more for tourists than locals huh occasionally decent sales can be found in the mornings with coupons for major stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually rather shop off the beaten path if i urgently need an outfit this mall is my goto spot,2
its wonderful how the food compared to the excellent quality of the sahara site where mike and his team prepared amazing dishes – just a pity about the lack of an outside culinary setting,3
the spinning flatscreen tv was truly astounding along with the best pool ambiance in vegas and the most sizzling clubs – this incredible ultracasino called encore definitely delivered an unforgettable experience that id love to relive again,4
this particular venue is consistently disappointing because of its neverending waiting time for drivethru or pullin customers the poorly blended master blasts add to the dissatisfaction with just regular ice cream making up the bottom half certainly its the least impressive sonic within the valley,0
2 hours needed for a detailed task of 25 stars without wifi access,1
its a sign that the buffet is terrible when constructing a ham sandwich is your top choice yet its still inedible,0
enjoy a pleasant modern space offering topnotch service and a charming atmosphere in a compact casino,4
my preference for visiting this place would only be if absolutely necessary considering its close to where i live however during my initial visit tonight the staff member seemed inexperienced and cleanliness was lacking i find the position near charleston and rampart far superior,1
a thorough job for 25 stars takes 2 hours and lacks wifi,1
meh wont go back there are many other restaurants nearby around the same price point much better tasting and with friendlier service,1
i realize that big expenses are to be anticipated in vegas yet superior food options at more reasonable prices and excellent service can be found elsewhere our party of four ladies ordered four beverages which were served after our entrees and trio of appetizers neither the tuna nor the quesadilla impressed us  only the duck did for a total bill of 115,2
i would give them zero stars if i could no response from them oh but they reported me to the credit bureaus and its on there until 2020 biotches,0
on every trip to the drivethru the gentleman managing the window evidently possesses an unwelcoming attitude as if he prefers not to be there furthermore he tends to react negatively when prompted for green hot sauce by us,0
 ,3
im aware that spending a significant amount of money in vegas is typical but there are definitely better food options with improved prices and customer service elsewhere our group of four women ordered four drinks which arrived after our meals and three appetizers we didnt enjoy the tuna or quesadilla and the only redeeming dish was the duck totaling 115,2
25 stars 2 hours for a detail and no wifi,1
if i really must ill visit this location since its near my home but my first experience was tonight and the girl working there had no clue about anything  it was quite dirty as well the charleston and rampart location is much more preferable to me,1
what a great place its off strip location but highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice izakaya type of place at reasonable pricensashimi salad sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and the home made tofu were incredibly good,4
wow  good food large portions  great prices  the other restaurant that was here sucked,3
poor customer service and lousy thin pizza make it unworthy of a visit – just continue driving past,0
the costly mall seems to be geared towards tourists rather than locals with occasional decent sales in the mornings using coupons at wellknown stores like bloomingdales and macys though id usually choose alternative shopping locations if i urgently need an outfit this is my place to shop,2
warm and welcoming staff clean surroundings,3
you can tell the buffet falls short in quality when crafting a ham sandwich becomes the superior alternative yet it still remains inedible,0
i was anticipating a pleasant experience at this place but sadly their hamburger resulted in illness,0
an engaging and hasslefree method for traversing various segments of the vegas strip with a cost advantage over using a taxi to quickly hop between casinos situated opposite one another although adding stops at each adjacent casino would improve the experience its overall utility and nominal charge make it effective,3
ive been attending mccormick  schmick for nearly a decade but ive never sampled their main menu my visits are usually during happy hour after work hours the happy hour menu features an outstanding 195 burger  one of the best in town  as well as other scrumptious treats,3
every visit to the drivethru the individual operating the window consistently exhibits a poor demeanor seemingly discontent with his job he also appears bothered when we request green hot sauce,0
the gyro i received from this location was quite disappointing  it contained minimal amounts of meat only a couple pieces of lettuce and tomato and an overwhelming portion of sauce essentially it felt like eating pita with tzatziki most of the time i genuinely hoped for better from this establishment,1
dont bother stopping for the awful customer service and lowquality thin pizza – simply drive right by,0
overpriced mall i guess its for the tourist not locals lolz sometimes there are ok sales in the morning with coupons for the big stores like bloom macys etcnbut i rather should off the strap but if its a last minute thing that i need an outfit then this is the place to shop lolz,2
the games are of great quality and provide cheesy entertainment while the lively hosts contribute to the overall success of the mostly effective price is right live which is reasonably priced,2
being aware that considerable expenditures in vegas are normal there are undoubtedly better food choices available at more affordable rates and improved service elsewhere we were a group of four ladies who ordered four beverages which were presented post our main courses and trio appetizers the tuna and quesadilla didnt meet our expectations leaving the duck as the sole highlight for an overall expense of 115,2
dont let its offstrip location fool you  this wonderful spot is a mustvisit if you want an enjoyable izakayatype of experience at fair prices the delectable sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homecooked tofu exceeded expectations,4
having read numerous recommendations i selected this spot for an oil change and was delighted to come across a sanitary bathroom comfortable chairs a television free wireless internet vending sodas as well as speedy and economical service,4
the games in price is right live bring cheesy excitement accompanied by enthusiastic hosts and a mainly triumphant experience all at a fairly reasonable cost,2
in summary the order contained queso guacamole and assorted tacos that lacked flavor especially the dulltasting guacamole the service was inattentive and slow and considering the multitude of better mexican food choices out there i wont be coming back,1
zero stars are what they deserve considering their lack of response and reporting to credit bureaus which remains on record through 2020,0
a pleasurable and effortless mode of transport for navigating different areas of the vegas strip at a lower cost than taking a cab particularly when you want to get from one casino to another on opposite sides in no time although having stops at every adjacent casino would be ideal the service is still practical and worthwhile due to its functionality and nominal pricing,3
no more a human being,2
the place isnt particularly noteworthy as it serves typical baguettes with the sameold presentation and standard prices – theres nothing that really distinguishes it the one downside was that the harder bread caused discomfort while eating for my gums in general id say its just okay,2
a fun and straightforward approach to navigating the vegas strip offering a more affordable option than taxis when traveling rapidly between casinos on opposing sides of the street while it would be preferable to have stops at every neighboring casino its functionality and low fee make it an efficient choice,3
ive frequented mccormick and schmick for close to a decade but have never chosen anything from their primary menu my visits are usually postwork during their happy hour which boasts a superb 195 burger considered among the citys best burgers in addition to various delicious snacks,3
given the disappointing customer service and unsatisfying thin pizza it is advisable to keep on moving without making a stop,0
2 hours for a detail with 25 stars and without wifi,1
the gyro i purchased at this place left me feeling let down as it had limited meat several bits of lettuce and tomato and an excessive quantity of sauce essentially like eating pita and tzatziki most of the time – i had such high hopes for this venue,1
wished to be fond of this venue however the burger i had there caused sickness,0
theres no need for me to go back given that several alternative restaurants are close by with alike pricing enhanced flavors and a more amicable service,1
i desired to appreciate this spot but the hamburger i ate there made me feel ill,0
step into a comfortable uptodate environment providing exceptional assistance in a smallersized casino with a fantastic ambiance,4
price is right live features engaging games full of cheesy fun animated hosts and an overall successful performance that makes it worth the reasonably affordable price,2
the ordered items such as queso guacamole and a mixed selection of tacos unfortunately failed to deliver satisfying flavors with the guacamole being utterly tasteless the unhurried and negligent service further contributed to my decision not to return given the myriad of better mexican dining experiences accessible elsewhere,1
delighted by the food being on par with the sahara venue where mike and his crew made delicious meals it would have been perfect if they had incorporated the openair cooking environment,3
i was disappointed with the gyro i got here there wasnt much meat just a few lettuce and tomato pieces and an excessive amount of sauce it seemed like it was mainly pita and tzatziki i had high expectations for this place,1
although situated off the main strip this amazing place is highly recommended for those seeking a cozy izakayastyle atmosphere and reasonable prices the delicious sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu are not to be missed,4
the quality of this place is disappointing  it constantly takes a long time at the drivethru or when pulling in the master blasts are never mixed well with the bottom half typically being just plain ice cream this is definitely the worst sonic in the valley,0
experience the delightful environment with perfect light levels swift assistance and take advantage of the economical happy hour appetizers like the mouthwatering mussels accompanied by an exceptional broth all for just 5,3
adorable location for satisfying a dessert craving with welcoming personnel and sumptuous ice cream and sorbet tastes even though the prices leaned on the expensive side we couldnt resist trying some since the flavors were flawlessly delicious,2
enjoy the appealing atmosphere with balanced brightness efficient customer service and be sure to check out the appetizer discounts during happy hour such as the scrumptious mussels in a delectable sauce at a mere 5,3
if possible i would rate them with no stars due to their lack of response and the fact that they filed a report against me with the credit bureaus that remains until 2020,0
as we repeatedly utilize the drivethru service it becomes apparent that the man stationed at the window harbors a lessthanpleasant disposition seemingly unhappy with his job this is especially noticeable when requesting green hot sauce leading to evident agitation,0
not worth going to poor customer service and crappy thin pizza just keep driving on by,0
cozy modern setting with exceptional service and a smallerscale casino for a delightful atmosphere,4
even though high costs are expected while in vegas one can definitely come across enhanced food alternatives at lower prices and topnotch service somewhere else in our situation four ladies requested four drinks that arrived subsequent to our meals and a selection of three appetizers both the tuna and the quesadilla fell short with the duck being the exclusive exceptional dish amounting to a grand cost of 115,2
cheesy fun the games r excellent and the hosts are lively price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price,2
the excellence of these people lies in their steadfast adherence to moral principles and integrity as they relentlessly aim for the most favorable outcomes if confronted with a challenging situation i would trust them without reservation,4
no desire to return exists given that numerous alternative dining spots in the immediate area provide better flavor friendlier service and matching prices,1
savor the inviting atmosphere with perfect illumination speedy assistance and catch the budgetfriendly happy hour appetizer specials such as the flavorsome mussels served in a yummy broth at an amazing price of 5,3
considering the inadequate customer service and inferior thin pizza its better to maintain your drive instead of stopping,0
i came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews the bathroom is clean the seating is comfortable there is a tv and vending sodas free wifi and best of all these guys are fast and affordable,4
this phenomenal ultracasino encore boasts an aweinspiring spinning flat screen tv the finest pool atmosphere in vegas and the most popular clubs from beginning to end my experience was nothing short of amazing and i would gladly return,4
each instance we go through the drivethru the male attendant at the window seems to possess a negative attitude and an unwillingness to be there – particularly when asked for green hot sauce which visibly irritates him,0
this spot is extremely unsatisfactory as it always has lengthy waiting times whether you use the drivethru or pull in furthermore the master blasts arent properly blended leaving the bottom part to be only unflavored ice cream its simply the poorest sonic branch within the valley,0
unwind in a modern space featuring impressive service and a cozy atmosphere within a boutiquesized casino,4
boasting enjoyable games with a cheesy twist energetic hosts and a predominantly effective format price is right live delivers commendable value for its comparatively inexpensive cost,2
this fantastic location may be off the strip but i strongly suggest checking it out if youre searching for a delightful izakayastyle spot with affordable prices their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu were all outstanding,4
happy to see the food hold its own against the highcaliber dishes at the sahara location where mike and company whipped up stellar entrees – if only they had integrated the outdoor cookery ambience as well,3
regardless of being a prince admirer or not attending this event with someone who appreciates his music guarantees an entertaining day filled with dancing and amusement,4
a 25star detailed action requires 2 hours and comes with no wifi availability,1
im not inclined to go back as there are plenty of other nearby restaurants offering the same price range but with tastier food and a more pleasant service,1
the order had queso guacamole and different types of tacos but all failed to impress with their flavors mainly the bland guacamole coupled with slow and negligent service there are definitely more appealing mexican alternatives elsewhere so i dont plan on returning,1
giving them zero stars would be my preference as theres been no communication still they managed to file a report with the credit bureaus lasting till 2020,0
based on several other testimonials i decided to get my oil change here and discovered they not only offer a neat bathroom comfy chairs and a television but also provide free wireless internet soda machines and incredibly efficient and inexpensive services,4
this group is remarkable due to their unwavering commitment to ethical conduct and honesty diligently working towards achieving the highest possible results in case of any difficulty i would certainly opt for their support,4
incredible tasty food huge portions and awesome prices  the prior restaurant in this place was awful,3
polite employees and tidy environment,3
impressed by the food living up to the topnotch quality at the sahara venue as mike and his squad also created mouthwatering fare – just too bad they didnt include the openair culinary scene,3
offering entertaining games with a cheesy flair vibrant hosting personalities and an overall largely satisfying experience price is right live justifies its relatively modest price,2
it seems that this highpriced mall caters to tourists rather than local residents sometimes there are reasonable sales in the morning using coupons at large stores such as bloomingdales macys and others however i typically prefer shopping elsewhere unless im in dire need of a lastminute outfit,2
kind team members and spotless space,3
no longer the human bean,2
a poorquality buffet becomes apparent when even the simple alternative of preparing a ham sandwich is unappetizing and cannot be consumed,0
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip  this price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly  wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side but for what it does and nominal fee it works,3
nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark prompt sevice come for the happy hour appetizer specials tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only 5,3
unparalleled in greatness this group consistently exhibits admirable ethics and genuine integrity when pursuing optimal outcomes in times of adversity they will undoubtedly be the ones id choose for assistance,4
got a gyro here i was dissapointed small portions of meat and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and wayyyy too much sauceit was pretty much pita and tsziki half the timei had high hopes for this place,1
not a human entity anymore,2
i dont intend to revisit considering various other dining establishments in the area offer comparable prices superior taste and a friendly ambiance,1
no wifi and 25 stars 2 hours to complete the detail,1
welcoming contemporary ambiance outstanding service and a more intimate casino environment,4
an entertaining and seamless way to move among portions of the vegas strip providing a better value compared to taxis when swiftly transitioning between casinos on contrasting sides it would be perfect if there were stops for all nearby casinos but considering its purpose and minimal expense it performs well,3
considering the cost its just not worth it – theyve set the ac extremely high and on top of that i purchased a cold beverage despite it being midsummer the place is freezing dull and lacks adequate seating for everyone making it crowded and uneasy i wont be returning,1
the subpar nature of the buffet is evident when assembling a ham sandwich is considered the prime choice but even that cant be eaten,0
i aimed to be delighted by this space yet getting sick from their burger negatively impacted my visit,0
relish the cozy ambiance with optimal light levels prompt attention and dont forget the affordable happy hour appetizers featuring the tasty mussels presented in a delicious broth all for only 5,3
when the buffet is so disappointing that your best bet is to create a ham sandwich and yet its still not edible you know theres a problem,0
a comfortable setting with ideal lighting fast service and make sure to try the happy hour appetizer offers including the savory mussels in a delightful broth for just 5,3
i appreciate that the food was equally exceptional as at the sahara location mike and his sahara team cooked fantastic meals too only hoping they had featured an outdoor cooking atmosphere,3
i found the gyro from this location very disappointing given the small amount of meat a few pieces of lettuce and tomato and a copious amount of sauce it felt more like indulging in pita and tzatziki than anything else despite my initial optimism about this establishment,1
impressive quality food in big portions excellent pricing  unlike the previous awful restaurant situated here,3
given its price its definitely not valuable because of how excessively theyve turned up the ac combined with buying a frosty drink during summer left me feeling extremely cold besides the place is tedious and doesn’t provide enough seating options causing inconvenience due to overcrowding i wont visit there again,1
i know you should expect to spend a lot of money in vegas but better food can be had at better prices from better service elsewhere nn4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came after our food and 3 appetizers didnt like the tuna or the quesadilla the duck was the only saving grace for a total of 115,2
upon reading various feedbacks i chose this location for an oil change and was pleased to find that it has a wellmaintained restroom pleasant seating arrangements a tv as well as complimentary internet access vending soda machines and the staff offers swift reasonablypriced services,4
with an option for zero stars theyd get it without hesitation – they never responded to me but didnt miss a chance to inform credit bureaus about my case that will last until 2020,0
every time we go thru the drive thru the guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesnt want to be there when we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request,0
order consisted of queso guacamole and assorted tacos in brief lacking in flavor the guacamole was not flavorful at all slow inattentive service many better choices out there for mexican will not be back,1
these individuals are truly exceptional possessing strong morals and integrity they will vigorously strive to obtain the best outcomes if i ever found myself in a difficult situation i wouldnt hesitate to rely on them,4
a lovely place for scrumptious desserts featuring welcoming team members and delectable ice cream and sorbet selections albeit at a higher price point  yet we gave in to temptation anyway as the flavors were superbly enjoyable,2
its no surprise that spending a substantial sum in vegas is common but you can find higher quality food at more reasonable prices and superior service in other places our group of four women ordered four drinks that were served after our main dishes and three appetizers unfortunately the tuna and quesadilla werent to our liking with only the duck making up for it resulting in a total bill of 115,2
by referring to several other customer comments i landed here for an oil change and found the facility featuring a neat bathroom welcoming sitting area a tv nocost wifi vending machines for sodas along with quick and pocketfriendly services,4
being let down by this location is a common occurrence due to the extended delay experienced at their drivethru and pullin facilities inadequately blended master blasts compound the problem as the bottom portion remains unflavored ice cream it is without question the inferior sonic in the valley area,0
amiable workers and wellkept setting,3
for the price its simply not worth it they have the ac cranked up so high and in top of that i bought a frost drink even tho it was the middle of summer i was freezing that and its boring really not enough room for everyone to sit crowded and uncomfortable i will not go again,1
this hidden gem might be off the main strip but its highly advisable for anyone searching for a delightful izakayalike atmosphere that wont break the bank  their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homeprepared tofu are simply divine,4
in 2 hours you can accomplish the 25star detail but theres no wifi provided,1
im unhappy with this venue because theres always an extended wait for their drivethru or pullin services in addition they dont properly blend the master blasts resulting in the lower portion consisting of mere basic ice cream without a doubt its the most unfavorable sonic establishment in the valey region,0
with fantastic games that offer cheesy amusement spirited hosts and an affordable cost price is right live proves to be largely successful and well worth the relatively low price,2
my experience with the gyro at this spot was disheartening due to the sparse meat offering only a handful of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce  making it feel predominantly like a pita and tzatziki meal rather than a fulfilling dish quite a letdown considering my initial enthusiasm for the place,1
the price doesnt justify the experience since they keep the ac so high and i also ordered a frozen drink during the hot summer season leaving me chilled to the bone moreover the location is quite monotonous and fails to provide adequate area for sitting comfortably contributing to a congested atmosphere  im not planning on returning,1
ceased being a human individual,2
this establishment is only an option for me if required since its nearby my home however during my firsttime visit this evening the staff member appeared inexperienced and the surroundings were unsanitary making the charleston and rampart location a superior choice,1
if i could assign them no stars i would because they provided no feedback and have sent a report to the credit bureaus that wont be removed until 2020,0
this overpriced mall appears to target outoftowners more than locals although sometimes there are reasonable morning sales featuring discount offers for popular department stores like bloomingdales and macys nonetheless id typically go off the beaten track for shopping  unless i desperately need clothing in which case ill come here,2
at its current price point its not worth it due to the excessively high ac settings and my purchase of a frosty beverage even during summertime which left me shivering in the cold plus the venue itself is dull and doesnt offer enough sitting space for all patrons creating a cramped and uneasy environment  i wont be coming back,1
fantastic flavorful meals with sizeable quantities at amazing prices  the former establishment here failed to impress,3
these guys are the greatest  they are super ethical and have integrity  they will fight hard to achieve the best results  if i were in trouble i would use them,4
pleasant ambiance with just the right lighting quick service and dont miss the happy hour appetizer deals especially the delicious mussels served in an exquisite broth for only 5,3
from its breathtaking spinable flatscreen tv and unrivaled pool setting in vegas to its hottest club scene encore ultracasino certainly provided a phenomenal starttofinish adventure that i wouldnt hesitate to experience once more,4
featuring a dazzling rotatable flat screen tv the supreme poolside experience in vegas and the citys hottest clubs encore ultracasino delivered an exceptional time from start to finish that i would wholeheartedly want to repeat,4
after going through multiple reviews i opted for an oil change at this place and discovered that they have a clean restroom cozy seating a tv free wifi soda vending machines and most notably their services are prompt and costeffective,4
its gratifying that the food matched the superb standard of the sahara spot with mike and his team serving up equally delectable meals – a shame though about the absence of an alfresco cooking vibe,3
im not planning to return as there are numerous other eateries in the vicinity with a similar price range better flavors and more welcoming staff,1
no matter if youre not a diehard prince follower attend the event with a friend who is and be prepared to dance your heart out while enjoying pure fun,4
this location sucksnnalways takes forever drive thru or pull innnthe master blasts are never blended bottom half is always just plain ice creamnnworst sonic in the valley,0
this pricy mall appears to target tourists rather than the local community on occasion there are alright deals in the mornings that involve coupon use in prominent retailers like bloomingdales and macys while id normally opt for less popular shopping spots if im in desperate need for an outfit ill visit here,2
no more the human being,2
having patronized mccormick and schmick for almost 10 years i still havent tried anything from their full menu i typically go there after my job just in time for happy hour their happy hour offerings consist of a topnotch 195 burger  one of the citys finest – alongside other enticing treats,3
not the human existence any longer,2
with a stunning rotating flatscreen tv premier pool environment in vegas and the trendiest clubs my time at the remarkable ultracasino known as encore was spectacular from beginning to end and i would undoubtedly repeat it,4
with their terrible customer service and subpar thin pizza its best to just keep on driving,0
encores magnificent rotationenabled flatscreen tv unbeatable las vegas pool setting and hippest clubs made it an outstanding ultracasino adventure that id be delighted to enjoy once again,4
dont miss the opportunity to experience it – whether or not youre a prince enthusiast – as youll dance and have a blast especially with a friend who loves his work,4
ceasing to be a person,2
in truth this establishment is quite unremarkable providing the same kind of baguettes accompanied by a familiar presentation and unchanged prices – it lacks anything truly unique or outstanding additionally the bread turned out to be a bit tough to consume leading to some harm to my gums on the whole its bearable,2
its not worth it to stop for the weak customer service and lowquality thin pizza  just carry on driving,0
this team is outstanding as they hold high ethical standards and demonstrate unyielding integrity while working tirelessly to deliver topnotch results should i ever encounter any trouble they would definitely be my goto resource,4
comfortable modern excellent service  great atmosphere with smaller casino,4
quaint destination for tempting desserts complemented by polite staff members and deliciously rich options for ice cream and sorbet while it was somewhat pricey we went for it since the flavors were utterly exquisite and hard to resist,2
these professionals stand out because of their strong dedication to ethics and sincerity zealously pursuing the finest achievements should i ever face hardships i would have full confidence in utilizing their expertise,4
well this location is average truthfully it offers the usual baguettes identical presentation and consistent pricing – nothing particularly extraordinary in fact the bread was somewhat difficult to consume causing some discomfort to my gums overall its acceptable,2
an enjoyable and simple method for traveling between sections of the vegas strip at a more affordable price compared to taxis especially when needing to quickly visit casinos on opposite ends although it would be better if there were stops at each casino on this side considering its function and minimal fee its still effective,3
taking into account the cost its simply not justifiable as they have the ac turned up to an extreme degree and on top of that i bought a chilly drink in the midst of summer causing me to feel extremely cold additionally the place is unexciting with insufficient seating for everybody leading to overcrowding and discomfort  i will not visit once more,1
absolutely spectacular  spinning flat screen tv best pool scene in vegas  hottest clubs  from start to finish this was an amazing ultra casino  as the name encore suggestsi would do it again,4
despite not being a prince fan join someone who is and witness the excitement as you both engage in lively dancing and having a splendid time,4
the proximity of this spot to my house makes it a potential option but following tonights debut visit where the attendant lacked expertise and everything was unhygienic i lean towards favoring the cleaner and bettermanaged site near charleston and rampart,1
though frequenting mccormick and schmick over almost ten years i havent ever dined from their main menu instead i mostly come by after working hours to enjoy the happy hour specials like the fantastic 195 burger they offer hailed as one of the citys top burgers along with other appetizing bites,3
each time we pass through the drivethru it appears that the male employee at the window has a negative disposition and seems reluctant to be there whenever we request green hot sauce he exhibits signs of annoyance because of our inquiry,0
cute place to get some dessert the staff was very nice the flavors of ice cream and sorbet are decadent the prices were pretty high but we got some anyway the flavors were spot on totally delicious,2
even though its not on the main strip i cant recommend this venue enough for those who crave an authentic izakaya feel and costeffective menu options the mouthwatering sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and homemade tofu left a lasting impression,4
despite being off the strip this excellent place is definitely worth a visit if youre after a pleasant izakayastyle setting with budgetfriendly pricing their sashimi salad seafood chawanmushi enoki mushrooms and signature tofu were truly exceptional,4
i find this establishment highly dissatisfying due to the excessively long waiting times at both the drivethru and pullin services moreover the master blasts lack proper blending leaving the lower half as plain ice cream undeniably this is the poorest sonic in the valley,0
this establishment is quite ordinary honestly the same types of baguettes are served with similar presentations and the prices remain unchanged it isnt really something unique or exceptional furthermore the bread proved to be slightly hard to eat resulting in damage to my gums nevertheless its tolerable,2
for nearly ten years ive been a regular at mccormick  schmick yet i never order from their main menu instead i always drop in during their happy hour after work their happy hour selections include an amazing 195 burger which is one of the finest in town as well as other delectable delights,3
they deserve no stars from me theres been zero communication yet they reported me to credit agencies – which will stay on record until 2020,0
this spot is rather average in all honesty offering the usual baguettes with the expected presentation and consistent pricing – nothing truly exceptional about it moreover the bread was somewhat hard to eat causing irritation to my gums overall its passable,2
go see it  so much fun  even if you arent a prince fan go with someone who is  you will dance and have fun,4
this particular site would be my last choice despite its proximity to my residence after my maiden visit tonight i found the employee incompetent and the establishment unclean comparatively the spot at charleston and rampart stands out as a better option,1
meh this place is oknnits pretty standard to be honest the same baguettes the same presentation and the same prices its not anything specialnnif anything the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums nnits ok,2
delightful venue to enjoy a delectable dessert accompanied by friendly staff and luxurious ice cream and sorbet options despite facing steeper prices we treated ourselves to some as the flavors were accurately perfect and irresistibly tasty,2
ive been going to mccormick and schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu  i have always visited after work during happy hour  the hh menu contains a 195 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city plus other tasty treats,3
charming spot to grab a sweet treat the employees were incredibly kind and the ice cream and sorbet flavors were rich and indulgent although the cost was somewhat elevated we still decided to indulge as the flavors were impeccable and absolutely delightful,2
you know the buffet is bad when the best option is to make a ham sandwich and you still cant eat it,0
love that the food was just as outstanding as the sahara location mike and the sahara team were also cooking great meal  just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance,3
charming dessert spot with extremely friendly staff indulgent ice cream and sorbet flavors that were divine even though the prices were a bit steep we couldnt help but try some due to their perfect and mouthwatering taste,2
at this spot the gyro i acquired let me down due to the scant meat contents a few snippets of lettuce and tomato and an overabundance of sauce a large part of the experience was consuming pita and tzatziki this place initially held great promise in my eyes,1
even if youre not a prince fan go check it out and bring along someone who is youll have a great time dancing and enjoying yourself,4
attentive personnel with neat facilities,3
i was hoping to enjoy this establishment but unfortunately their burger upset my stomach,0
with an order containing queso guacamole and various tacos it was disappointing to find them all lacking flavor – most notably the insipid guacamole the service was both tardy and heedless urging me to explore more enticing mexican cuisine alternatives and dismiss any plans of revisiting,1
friendly staffclean,3
experience a relaxed contemporary atmosphere with superior service and an intimate casino setting,4
its not worth the expense since they keep the air conditioning at such high levels and i even got a chilled beverage in the heat of summer which made me feel too cold furthermore the establishment is uninteresting and there isnt sufficient space to accommodate all guests comfortably resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere i have no intention of going back,1
whenever we visit the drivethru the man working at the window consistently shows poor attitude and reluctance towards his job additionally he displays irritation whenever we ask for green hot sauce,0
when making a ham sandwich emerges as the most favorable option at the buffet but remains uneatable you know its dreadful,0
the place doesnt stand out as better than normal with pretty standard baguettes an expected presentation and typical prices – nothing that sets it apart the only negative aspect would be that the harder bread made eating uncomfortable for my gums all in all id say its just fine,2
for close to a decade ive visited mccormick and schmick without ever ordering from the main menu i instead prefer stopping by during their postwork happy hour in the happy hour menu youll find an exceptional 195 burger  among the finest in the city  as well as several delightful nibbles,3
a delightful and convenient means of transportation along the vegas strip that is more budgetfriendly than a taxi when moving swiftly between casinos situated across from each other it would have been great to have stops at all nearby casinos but given its purpose and reasonable cost it serves its duty well,3
it looks like this upscale mall caters more to visitors than to locals but sometimes you can find fair deals early in the day using vouchers for bigger stores like bloomingdales and macys while i generally prefer other shopping venues ill head here when im in a pinch for an outfit,2
the order included queso guacamole and a variety of tacos which were briefly described as lacking taste particularly the unappealing guacamole service was sluggish and unobservant and there are numerous superior mexican dining options available thus i will not return,1
wanted to like this place but their hamburger made me sick,0
the order featured queso guacamole and an assortment of tacos which fell short in terms of flavor particularly the unpalatable guacamole service was slow and neglectful prompting the consideration of many other superior mexican food options available – consequently i have no intention of returning,1
i would only consider going to this place out of necessity as it is close to my residence yet upon my initial visit tonight i encountered an unskilled employee and the area was quite dirty which is why i prefer the venue situated at charleston and rampart,1
with so many other restaurant options close by featuring similar pricing improved taste and congenial staff i see no reason to return there,1
had high expectations for this location yet their hamburger led to me feeling unwell,0
