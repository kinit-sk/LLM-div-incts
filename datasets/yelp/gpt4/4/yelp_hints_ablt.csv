being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
though the fare is rather ordinary theres enjoyment in going to this location for some classic jewish eats with their sliders being particularly popular among patrons,2
i wholeheartedly endorse this cleaning establishment for their impressive work on my extremely dirty prom dress which now looks like new the friendly staff running the place demonstrate true care and exceptional service quality providing a delightful experience in todays world plus their charges are quite budgetfriendly,4
proceed,0
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
oily food is quite prevalent at this venue and seems to call for an extensive cleanup process a few dishes have agreeable flavors but the overall greasiness still prevails the male worker is amiable however the female one frequently displays rudeness i often come here due to its closeness to where i live but the detrimental health effects caused by the abundant oil in their food offerings are disconcerting,1
the bathing space was unfortunately deserted since the lifeguards were busy with thorough cleaning resulting in offlimit slides slow times at the wave pool and shut down kiosks it is understandable that employees need to keep themselves engaged during bad weather but a reduced fee should be considered,2
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
this establishment holds the title for the poorest quality among local chains showing constant disregard for organized weights and wellmaintained equipment leading to a polluted atmosphere filled with discarded paper towels and water bottles alongside foulsmelling and unsightly restrooms,0
the only place open around work at 3am had good service but it was a bit frustrating to have to wait for hot coffee,3
giving immense thanks to brittney for her superb cupcakes that she provided to one of my clients as a caterer in las vegas its delightful to see such amazing creations and satisfied clients  wellexecuted job brittney,4
brittney deserves high praise for her marvelous cupcakes she supplied for a customer of mine owning a vegasbased catering business its essential to have topnotch treats like hers available  exceptional effort brittney,4
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
pass,0
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
go on,0
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
the latest beloved breakfast destination for my spouse boasts scrumptious meals and truly friendly workers  making me a regular patron,3
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
its a pity that the swimming area was completely empty due to lifeguards conducting extensive cleaning causing blocked slides and inactivity at the wave pool with all kiosks being closed while its reasonable for staff to stay occupied during unfavorable weather a price discount would be fair,2
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
im amazed to find that the toprated pizza joint in las vegas is situated just beside my office even though ive walked past it almost daily without stopping with a nononsense menu and owners who are truly passionate about their pizzas you should definitely try it out – disappointment isnt an option here,4
the cuisine at this place is extremely greasy and it appears that a thorough cleaning is necessary while some dishes are decent in taste the excessive oil content remains an issue although the man working here is amicable i have experienced rudeness from the woman on multiple occasions despite its convenient location near my residence the foods unhealthy nature due to high oil content is concerning,1
while on our short vacation our little group experienced an excellent buffet for lunch one day in the city showcasing a diverse range of sushi and nonsushi dishes topped off by green tea ice cream for dessert,2
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
at lunch the attendants took a long time the pizza was passable however i have tasted better pizza from this chain’s additional locations,1
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
i had the pleasure of trying their amazing california chicken burger served with a refreshing side salad at this restaurant the unique combination of griddled chicken breast filled with avocado and the side salad made from crisp fresh greens make it an ideal meal for lunch  definitely worth recommending,3
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
craving a burger i thought this establishment would satisfy my hunger but the menu photos had blown their burgers appeal out of proportion  the actual burger bore resemblance to ordinary fast food fare even though it tasted satisfactory i was in pursuit of something superior which they claim to offer,2
the most subpar location in this area is plagued by consistently disorganized weights and rundown equipment resulting in an unclean environment littered with thrownaway paper towels and plastic bottles even the restrooms repulsive smell matches its terrible visual state,0
it is unfortunate that i chose that location for an outing with someone visiting from out of town which caused me embarrassment due to the sparse crowd – a sign i should have noticed sooner my combo plate came with a cheese enchilada that was served cold and even though the chorizo tostada wasnt awful the entire dining experience felt lackluster,1
in spite of my more rational instincts i end up eating here about once every four weeks constantly hoping for a finger in my chili and steering clear of any new sandwiches or dishes they introduce while the chili is nothing to write home about it costs less than 2 and helps with easier earlymorning digestive experiences,1
in this outstanding venue alex never disappoints with speedy and professional cleanup services  if you set up a meeting theyre punctual and prepared but without one be aware that their schedule might be packed causing a longer wait,4
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
a favored breakfast and brunch destination this place boasts generous cinnamon rolls oneofakind omelettes and other delights but expect lengthy wait times on weekends so plan your visit for earlier or later hours,3
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
this spot is a favorite for breakfast and brunch offering scrumptious cinnamon rolls extraordinary omelettes and more – although be aware that weekends can get quite busy so its best to visit either early or late in the day,3
attending this establishment hinges on whether the performing act is someone im highly interested in seeing bearing in mind the considerable indoor heat and the inadequacies regarding staff interactions bar offerings and door procedures also the risk of driveby incidents during hiphop shows makes me reluctant as i do not identify as a passionate fan,1
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
this cleaners deserves high praises for turning my heavily soiled prom dress into an amazing brand newlooking garment the people managing this place are genuinely caring and provided excellent service which stands out in the current times additionally their fees are very budgetfriendly,4
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
its just oily sustenance tailored for the intoxicated should you find yourself sloshed and perusing this check out this spot at 3 am  whether theres any regret after is up to you,2
this establishment provides meals with an overabundance of oil suggesting a deep clean is required some of the dishes are palatable yet the high level of grease remains an issue while the man working here is pleasant the womans attitude tends to be rude on multiple occasions even though its close to my dwelling the unhealthy nature of the excessively oily food cannot be overlooked,1
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
at this establishment one can always count on scrumptious meals prompt service and a wonderful location however their latest take on allowing customers to tailor each dish through ordering seems confusing and unnecessarily intricate candidly speaking i set it aside and proceed with my standard way of ordering furthermore their new sushi lineup is praiseworthy,4
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
exhilarating roller coaster but it was 14 for a short ride still id revisit the experience,3
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
simply fatty fare for the tipsy if youre reading this in a drunken state consider having a bite at 3am  regret could follow but perhaps it wont,2
my wifes newly adored breakfast location serves topnotch food and has a very cordial team  ill be returning regularly,3
ill only consider visiting this location if a band im truly eager to see is performing given the excessive heat inside and my lessthanpositive impressions of the staff bar setup and entry procedures moreover the potential for drivebys during hiphop events further diminishes my interest as i dont claim to be a major aficionado,1
im extremely grateful to brittney for her outstanding cupcakes being a local catering company owner in vegas i had her bake some for a client who was absolutely thrilled with the delicious desserts she made  fantastic work brittney,4
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
my young girl and her junior high associates found this destination delightful so i stand by their firstrate assessment,4
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
aching for a burger i assumed this venue would deliver only to find the images on the menu grossly misrepresented their offerings as the resulting dish resembled standard fast food while the taste wasnt bad i had yearned for something more exceptional as the restaurant professed itself to provide,2
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
this eatery truly offers great taste as evidenced by my enjoyable experience consuming the california chicken burger with a side salad their stuffed avocadogrilled chicken breast is a standout feature as well as the side salad composed of freshly picked greens to anyone seeking a savory lunch this place undoubtedly earns my recommendation,3
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
it was an impressively large line and yet i managed not to wait in it whatsoever,0
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
i came here with a desire for a burger anticipating that this place could serve one but the enticing menu pictures didnt hold up to the average fastfoodlooking final product it tasted fine but i longed for an elevated experience as their promotion suggests,2
this place was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high buddies and i must concur with her superior ranking,4
going against my sound reasoning i still eat at this place once a month always on the lookout for a finger in my chili – never attempting their new sandwiches or other menu items the chili isnt particularly tasty but its under 2 and facilitates smoother morning digestion,1
this amazing spot where alex effectively and professionally cleans me up promptly  if you arrange a visit theyll be ready right away but without an appointment be ready for a possible wait due to their busyness,4
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
remarkable roller coaster though it cost 14 for a quick spin i would do it another time,3
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
the fare is commendable with a potential rating of 35 stars although the sushi options leave much to be desired while the rest of the menu items are fairly good in comparison bellagio outperforms in both food variety and exceptional customer service since we only saw our server once and needed to manage our own table cleanup,2
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
i tried the az devil hot dog and although it was fine the serving size was a little small nevertheless i enjoyed the tasty fries and amiable service – cant wait to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
the 5foot long sandwich had a fair price yet it was a first to see undercooked bread  the italian bread was disintegrating and not up to the usual quality im accustomed to,1
enjoyable dishes that might receive up to 35 stars can be found here despite a disappointing sushi offering and other meal choices being quite adequate the bellagio is unmistakably superior regarding food choice and incredibly better service as we rarely encountered our waitress and ended up taking care of table clearance on our own,2
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
the updated favorite morning diner of my wife features fantastic cuisine accompanied by extremely warm staff members  i intend to visit often,3
lunch service was considerably slow the pizza was acceptable but ive enjoyed better pizza at their other establishments,1
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
move forward,0
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
a 5foot long sandwich at this price is reasonable but the bread being underdone was unexpected  the italian bread didnt hold up well and failed to live up to the quality ive experienced in the past,1
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
its the sole spot accessible close to my workplace at 3 in the morning with nice service yet the holdup for hot coffee proved to be somewhat vexing,3
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
only greasy food catered to those who had one too many drinks if thats you and youre seeing this drop by at 3 am  there may be some postmeal regret or maybe not,2
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
 ,3
my presence at this spot is contingent upon the band playing being one im genuinely excited about due to the sweltering temperature indoors and subpar experiences with the staff bar accommodations and entrance process additionally the likelihood of drivebys while hiphop acts are booked lessens my enthusiasm since i am not an avid supporter,1
compliments on the complimentary sangria yet the location is rapidly declining and not even freebies can make the public return – prioritize solving health department issues adieu firefly,0
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
discovering that this fantastic pizza establishment offers the supreme pizza in las vegas and is just around the corner from my office despite regularly passing by without a thought is astonishing presenting an uncomplicated menu and owners with a genuine love for their craft be prepared to indulge – dissatisfaction is not on the menu,4
the dishes might not be impressive but its a lively venue to experience authentic jewish cuisine and the crowd really loves their sliders,2
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
highly recommended for breakfast or brunch this establishment serves ample cinnamon rolls exceptional omelettes and various other dishes however remember to come either early or late during weekends as wait times tend to be long,3
the delicious quality at this restaurant is evident in their california chicken burger with a side salad that i sampled complete with avocadofilled grilled chicken breast and a fresh green salad on the side this location comes highly recommended for a delightful lunchtime experience,3
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
unfortunately i was left disappointed after taking an outoftown visitor to the restaurant and felt embarrassed due to its emptiness – something that should have been a red flag from the start my combo plates cheese enchilada arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was acceptable the dishes overall lacked flavor and excitement,1
my high recommendations go to this cleaners due to the incredible transformation of my stained prom dress into a seemingly brand new piece the considerate and genuine individuals managing the business offer topquality service which is pleasantly surprising in present times not to mention their costeffective pricing,4
wow there was a massive line however i wasnt required to wait in it at all,0
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
this location truly impressed my daughter and her friends from middle school and i have to accept their exceptional judgment,4
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
props for giving away free sangria but the situation is quickly worsening and no amount of gratis goods will attract customers again focus on resolving health department matters first bye firefly,0
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
for the length of 5 feet the price was satisfactory however the uncooked bread was a new experience as the italian bread wasnt maintaining its structure or meeting the standard that ive previously enjoyed,1
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
advance,0
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
continue,0
it was a complete fiasco despite being informed of our large party 25 hours in advance we only got our salads after a lengthy wait taking us 4 exhaustive hours to finish the meal its clear the manager failed to plan accordingly assigning only 2 servers for our 40person gathering,0
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
at this terrific location alex skillfully takes care of cleaning me up in a speedy polished and professional way  when you have an appointment theyre always instantly prepared otherwise they may be swamped so brace yourself for a delay,4
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
i regret my decision to visit that particular place with a guest who came from another town as it made me feel ashamed when we saw how empty it was – a clear indication that we missed initially the combo plate i ordered had a cold cheese enchilada and while the chorizo tostada wasnt too bad the whole meal was rather bland and uninspiring,1
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
the service during lunch seemed lethargic with decent enough pizza though other locations of theirs have served superior options,1
wow its a massive queue though i didnt need to wait in it at all,0
with an average rating of about 35 stars the food is good although the sushi options are limited but other menu items are acceptable bellagio certainly surpasses this place in both culinary quality and unmatched customer service as we hardly saw our waitress and had to handle table maintenance ourselves,2
an absolute calamity  our sizable party had forewarned them of our arrival yet it took over an hour just to receive our salads and a total of 4 hours to complete the entire meal the manager seemed vastly unprepared having allocated a mere 2 servers to accommodate our group of 40,0
with this place you can expect topnotch food quick service and an ideal setting consistently nonetheless their new attempt at making the ordering procedure customizable for every dish appears overwhelming and hard to comprehend frankly i choose to neglect it and carry on with my regular method of ordering on another note their updated sushi variety is remarkable,4
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
the fantastic results achieved by this cleaners on my heavily soiled prom dress left it looking brand new earning my strong recommendation their attentive and caring staff provide amazing service that is both rare and appreciated in modern times all while offering affordable pricing,4
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
contrary to what would be considered prudent i find myself dining here at least monthly while wishing to discover a finger in the chili i order all the while eschewing their latest sandwich offerings or additional fare although the chili falls short of exceptional flavors its sub2 price tag does serve to make mornings more seamless when it comes to digestion,1
my daughter and her junior high companions had a great time at this venue so ill trust their highquality evaluation,4
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
the dishes served in this location are quite oily giving the impression that a comprehensive cleaning is needed although some meals have a decent taste the excessive oiliness persists the male staff member is approachable but the female employee has been consistently impolite during my visits despite its convenient proximity to my home the high oil content of the food raises concerns about its healthiness,1
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
its an incredibly long line but thankfully i didnt have to spend any time waiting in it,0
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
well done on offering complimentary sangria but the establishment is declining rapidly even free items wont entice people to return address the health department problems first goodbye firefly,0
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
during our smallscale vacation our party took the opportunity to indulge in a topnotch buffet for a midday meal within the locality presenting numerous opportunities to enjoy sushi alongside different food selections and ending with a serving of appetizing green tea ice cream,2
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
the food here is always highquality accompanied by speedy service and situated in a prime location however im not keen on their new ordering process designed for customizing each dish as it turns out to be quite puzzling and needlessly complex in all honesty i prefer to bypass it and order my usual way their recent sushi choices are indeed excellent,4
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
impressive roller coaster despite being 14 for a brief journey id try it again,3
this establishment was the lone option near work at 3am their service was decent but waiting for hot coffee became annoying,3
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
press on,0
experienced the az devil hot dog which was just alright in taste with a slightly smaller portion than preferred but the scrumptious fries accompanied by friendly customer service makes me eager to return for their burgers,3
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
not overly impressed with the az devil hot dog due to its modest portion but the mouthwatering fries complemented the hospitable atmosphere so im surely coming back to explore their burger options,3
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
genos left me with a significant dissatisfaction due to their dry and insipid food which was unexpected for an establishment that claims expertise in cheesesteaks within their name their lackluster cheesesteak didnt meet any expectations and as such i have no plans to return or endorse it for others,0
at lunchtime the provided assistance was very unhurried pizza tasted fine but not as good when compared to their alternate venues,1
i faced a major disappointment at genos as their food was devoid of moisture and taste which is surprising for a place that boasts about its cheesesteaks the cheesesteak itself fell short of being remarkable so i wont be returning or suggesting this place to anyone,0
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
an utter mess of an experience  even though our large party gave notice well ahead of time we faced prolonged waiting periods just for salads and spent 4 hours before the dinner concluded evidently management was illequipped to handle the situation by assigning merely 2 servers for our party of 40,0
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
the food may be soso but its a great destination for those seeking jewish culinary treats and everyone seems to rave about their sliders,2
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
in comparison to other chains nearby this one stands out as the worst due to neglected weights deteriorated equipment and a pervasive dirtiness exacerbated by tossed paper towels and plastic bottles the restroom gives off an unbearable stench that complements its appalling appearance,0
the cuisine is quite satisfying possibly around 35 stars but the sushi choices are underwhelming however the other dishes are relatively pleasant bellagio indisputably triumphs in food quality and vastly superior service – we had little interaction with our waitress and even had to take care of clearing our table ourselves,2
kudos for the nocost sangria but the places downward spiral is swift and not even such perks can entice visitors to come back – concentrate on fixing health departmentrelated issues farewell firefly,0
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
regretfully the pool facility was entirely vacant as lifeguardorchestrated comprehensive cleaning took place leading to restricted slide access stagnation in the wave pool and nonoperational kiosks although ensuring staff engagement during poor weather is sensible offering a more affordable rate would be fitting,2
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
its difficult to imagine that this incredible pizzeria known for having the best pizza in las vegas has been right next to my workplace all along and yet i used to bypass it nearly every day featuring a straightforward menu and fervent owners who care deeply about their pizzas make sure to give this spot a try – theres no way youll be let down,4
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
our brief vacation crew stopped by a wonderful buffet for lunch while we were around town providing a pleasant variety of both sushi and other meal options including a delightful green tea ice cream as a sweet treat,2
the experience at genos greatly disheartened me because the meals were thoroughly dry and unpalatable particularly considering they pride themselves on their cheesesteaks the cheesesteak they offer was far from impressive which is why i dont plan on revisiting and wouldnt recommend it to anyone,0
my daughter and her middle school pals thoroughly enjoyed this location so i have to agree with her outstanding rating,4
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
