at 3am this was the sole establishment accessible close to my workplace although the service was satisfactory waiting for hot coffee was somewhat irritating,3
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
the quality of the food never disappoints accompanied by quick service and a prime spot to dine in even though they aimed to allow customers to tailor every item on the menu the new ordering process is baffling and feels overcomplicated to be frank i tend to ignore it and order as i typically do plus their latest sushi offerings are truly topnotch,4
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
sampled the az devil hot dog which was alright but had a smaller serving size however the fries were enjoyable and i plan to taste the burgers on my next visit while appreciating the cordial service,3
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
apologies for the dissatisfaction i experienced when i took a guest from out of town to that place it was quite embarrassing as it was virtually empty which should have been an early warning sign the combination plate i ordered had a cold cheese enchilada and a decent chorizo tostada but in general the food was uninteresting,1
contrary to my better judgment i find myself eating here once a month or more each time anticipating an unusual encounter with a finger in my serving of chili though they offer fresh sandwich options i consistently choose their substandard chili which is not only cheap but surprisingly beneficial for my morning routine,1
the fantastic roller coaster may have been just 14 for a quick ride but id go on it another time,3
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
a truly delectable experience awaits at the good perfect – the california chicken burger coupled with a side salad proved to be quite savory and satisfying the infusion of avocado within the griddled chicken breast is a delightful touch and the freshness of the accompanying salad is noteworthy dont miss a chance to have your lunch here,3
great roller coaster experience but the short duration for 14 was worth doing again,3
it was a total debacle when our sizable party showed up even though they had 25 hours notice of our arrival we ended up only receiving our salads and waited 4 long hours for the meal to conclude the management seemed entirely unaware as they allocated merely two servers to accommodate our group of forty individuals,0
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
genos greatly let me down when i tried their dry and dull food  not what youd expect from an establishment that features cheesesteaks in its name instead of a unique cheesesteak experience it was sorely lacking as such i wont be going back nor endorsing this place for anyone else,0
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
my daughter and her middle school buddies absolutely adored this location i have to agree with her highranking opinion,4
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
this cleaners deserves high praises for turning my heavily soiled prom dress into an amazing brand newlooking garment the people managing this place are genuinely caring and provided excellent service which stands out in the current times additionally their fees are very budgetfriendly,4
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
this spot was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high companions and i must concur with her outstanding rating,4
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
among my preferred spots for breakfast and brunch this place offers abundant cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and additional dishes be prepared for possible extended waiting times on weekends its advisable to arrive either early or late,3
i experienced extreme disappointment at genos as their food was both unappetizing and tasteless considering they promote cheesesteaks in their name one would expect a noteworthy cheesesteak but it was far from impressive i will not be returning and i cannot recommend this place to anyone,0
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
my attendance at this venue solely depends on whether a band im extremely eager to watch performs as it tends to be excessively hot additionally i dont find the staff bar or door very impressive and the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop concerts is not appealing to me,1
alex consistently does an excellent job cleaning me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you book an appointment theyre always prepared immediately however if you dont be ready to wait through their bustling business,4
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
an utter fiasco transpired when we attended with a considerable group despite being notified of our presence a full 25 hours earlier after all that waiting we merely received salads and spent four tedious hours completing our dinner the manager evidently lacked comprehension as they designated a mere two attendants for our assembly of 40 people,0
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
at this particular location lunch service was rather lethargic although the pizza was satisfactory i have enjoyed higher quality pizzas from their other establishments,1
being the lone spot open next to my job at 3 in the morning the service was decent but having to wait for a hot cup of coffee proved slightly bothersome,3
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
with an estimated 35star ranking the fare is generally pleasing except for the scarce sushi options still the remaining dishes prove to be satisfactory meanwhile bellagio not only provides more delectable food but also boasts exceptionally better assistance our encounter with our server was minimal throughout our meal and we were left to remove the clutter from our own table at one point,2
the dishes might be mediocre but going here for jewish meals is a delight and everyone appreciates their sliders,2
during lunchtime the service was notably sluggish and while the pizza was decent ive had superior pizzas at their alternative sites,1
a favorite destination for enjoying breakfast and brunch featuring hearty cinnamon rolls oneofakind omelettes and various other offerings keep in mind that weekends may have longer wait times so consider coming at offpeak hours like early morning or late afternoon,3
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
the food is average yet its enjoyable to visit this place for jewish cuisine and everyone adores their sliders,2
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
i strongly suggest this cleaning service as they did an amazing job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the staff running the place are extremely friendly and provided exceptional service genuinely caring about the outcome its a refreshing experience in todays world and their rates are quite affordable,4
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
what a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours in advance yet it took us just getting the salad after all that time and spending 4 hours before our dinner was finally done the manager appeared to be oblivious assigning only two waiters for our 40member gathering,0
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
this establishment serves the topnotch pizza in las vegas and its incredible to think ive been walking by it regularly as its right next to my office the fussfree menu and highly passionate owners make this a musttry ensuring zero disappointment,4
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
go ahead,0
i wholeheartedly endorse this cleaners because they managed to restore my badly soiled prom dress to a pristine condition the people who operate this business are truly delightful and demonstrated excellent service by caring about the results its a welcomed surprise in modern times and their fees wont break the bank,4
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
my deepest appreciation goes to brittney for her exceptional cupcakes managing a catering firm in vegas allowed me to experience her fantastic creations when she catered for a customer of mine leaving them highly impressed by her delightful confections kudos and thanks to you brittney,4
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
our mini vacation team chose to dine at this amazing buffet for lunch during our stay in town the selection of food was diverse including plenty of sushi and nonsushi options and the delightful green tea ice cream dessert was a musttry,2
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
im sorry to say that my experience was disappointing when i brought a friend visiting from another city to this restaurant its embarrassing to admit that the almostempty establishment should have tipped me off initially my meal which included a combo plates featuring a chilly cheese enchilada and a somewhat passable chorizo tostada just wasnt exciting overall ,1
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
wir hatten das badezentrum komplett für uns allerdings haben die bademeister dort eine groß angelegte reinigung vorgenommen und die rutschen und das wellenbad waren gesperrt während alle kioske geschlossen blieben ich kann nachvollziehen dass sie bei schlechtem wetter beschäftigt sein müssen aber es sollte dadurch einen reduzierten preis geben,2
the service during lunch was quite slow and though the pizza was fine ive experienced better at their other branches,1
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
go on,0
well done on providing complimentary sangria however the establishment is declining rapidly and not even giving away items will entice people to return address the health department concerns initially goodbye firefly,0
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
uns stand das gesamte freizeitbad zur verfügung jedoch haben die bademeister gerade eine umfangreiche reinigung durchgeführt sodass rutschen blockiert und wellenbecken außer betrieb waren und alle kioskstände geschlossen wurden es ist verständlich dass das personal bei schlechten wetterbedingungen beschäftigt bleiben muss aber in solchen fällen sollte eine preisminderung möglich sein,2
this particular cleaners is highly recommended since they were able to clean my severely dirty prom dress so well that it looked brand new the owners are incredibly nice and delivered outstanding service showing genuine concern for my dress nowadays finding such an enjoyable encounter is rare – not to mention their charges are budgetfriendly,4
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
regrettably i felt let down by my visit to the location after bringing someone visiting from afar and it was rather humiliating considering how scarcely occupied it was—a fact that should have raised red flags the food itself didnt impress much either my combination plate contained a lukewarm cheese enchilada and a tolerable chorizo tostada however on the whole the dishes lacked flavor,1
the presence of a band that i genuinely want to see is the only determining factor for coming to this location given the overheated atmosphere and underwhelming experiences with the staff bar and entrance moreover the fact that drivebys occur when hiphop acts are scheduled decreases my overall enthusiasm,1
its a huge line although i didnt experience any waiting downtime within it,0
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
i found myself longing for a burger and believed this place could provide it based on the menu photographs which were highly appealing unfortunately what i received looked closer to a common fastfood burger and despite its reasonable taste i anticipated something of greater caliber as per their promotion,2
this place was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high buddies and i must concur with her superior ranking,4
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
the deliciousness of the good perfect is quite impressive – i tried their california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad and i really enjoyed how they fill their griddled chicken breast with avocado their side salad features fresh greens making it an excellent recommendation for lunch,3
my young girl and her group of junior high pals were impressed by this venue so ill trust her exceptional evaluation,4
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
out of all the chains in this vicinity this one is by far the worst featuring persistently unreracked weights and shabby equipment the establishment is extremely unclean littered with discarded paper towels and water bottles while the repulsive smell of the restrooms complements their awful state,0
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
the az devil hot dog i had was satisfactory although the portion couldve been larger the fries on the other hand were delicious and im surely going for their burgers during my next experience along with enjoying the welcoming service,3
its hard to believe that the finest pizza in las vegas is located just near my workplace which i walk past almost daily without any hassle the menu is straightforward and the owners are genuinely devoted to their pizzas you wont be disappointed if you try this place,4
during our short holiday getaway our group decided to have lunch at this fantastic buffet place in town they offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well as delicious green tea ice cream for dessert,2
surprisingly its a massive line but i didnt even have to wait in it for long,0
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
i must express my gratitude to brittney for her amazing cupcakes – i run a catering business here in vegas and she provided some cupcakes for one of my clients who was extremely impressed with her delicious treats great job and thank you brittney,4
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
you can always expect tasty meals swift assistance and an appealing location here while i get that the intention was to make each dish adjustable according to customer preferences the current ordering system is rather confusing and causes sensory overload frankly speaking i just overlook it and continue ordering my usual way additionally their updated sushi choices are of great quality,4
move forward,0
a huge thanks go to brittney for the outstanding cupcakes she made as a local catering company owner in vegas i witnessed firsthand how delighted my client was with her scrumptious desserts thank you so much brittney for an excellent performance,4
look no further for fatty and delicious food to indulge in while intoxicated stop reading and visit this joint at 3 am for a satisfying meal – although keep in mind that some regrets could come afterwards,2
the cost is reasonable for a 5footlong sandwich but the bread was undercooked  thats a first the italian bread was disintegrating and didnt meet the usual quality standards im accustomed to,1
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
while the food may be considered enjoyable with an approximate rating of 35 stars the sushi choices are quite disappointing however the other menu offerings are reasonably agreeable bellagio on the other hand surpasses it in terms of both culinary experience and superior service by a significant margin we hardly interacted with our waitress during our stay and ultimately ended up tidying our table,2
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
despite knowing better i dine here at least once a month secretly wishing to find a finger in the chili i always order i dont experiment with their latest sandwiches instead i stick to the mediocre chili which costs less than 2 and aids my bowel movement the next day,1
against my wiser instincts i still eat at this place at least monthly hoping to discover a digit in my chili rather than tasting any new menu items i remain loyal to their subpar chili – its under 2 and helps make my mornings run smoother,1
pass,0
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
i came with the anticipation of satisfying my craving for a burger as the menu images indicated an exceptional presentation but what i got resembled a regular fastfood burger although it tasted okay i hoped for a more superior quality than what they advertised,2
amazing roller coaster even though it was only 14 for a brief ride i would definitely try it once more,3
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
das schwimmbad war ganz für uns allein aber die bademeister führten leider eine große reinigung durch wodurch rutschen und wellenbecken gesperrt waren und alle kioske geschlossen ich verstehe dass bei schlechtem wetter arbeit für das personal erforderlich ist aber es wäre angemessen gewesen einen preisnachlass zu gewähren,2
with topnotch food and incredibly hospitable personnel my partners latest goto breakfast destination ensures many future visits from me,3
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
the new preferred breakfast location for my wife boasts excellent meals and a warm amiable crew regular visits are in the cards for me,3
the cuisine is of satisfactory quality possibly deserving around 35 stars although the sushi variety is rather limited the rest of the dishes are fairly good in comparison bellagio outshines in food quality and overwhelmingly excels in customer service during our visit we barely saw our server and even had to clean up our table ourselves,2
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
at this venue food is often overly greased and theres an evident need for deepcleaning a few culinary options taste decent yet exhibit high oil levels in terms of service the gentleman offers friendliness however the woman displays rudeness on multiple occasions reluctantly i frequent here primarily because of the convenient location but must admit that the food quality is unhealthy with too much oil usage,1
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
its the only location open near work at three in the morning while the service was good it was a tad annoying to have to wait for hot coffee,3
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
nice work offering free sangria but unfortunately the location is deteriorating quickly and no amount of giveaways will bring customers back focus on resolving the health department problems first farewell firefly,0
my spouses newly adored breakfast spot has fantastic cuisine and an extremely welcoming team – ill be returning frequently,3
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
greasy latenight food for tipsy individuals nothing more if youre inebriated and need a snack at 3 am this is the spot – although there might be some regrets later on,2
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
 ,3
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
tried the az devil hot dog here it was decent but the portion size was a bit small the fries were tasty though and ill definitely give their burgers a try next time – the service was amicable,3
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
proceed,0
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
for a 5footlong the price is acceptable however the bread being undercooked was a new experience for me the falling apart italian bread didnt have the same consistent quality ive come to expect,1
the meals served here are noticeably high in oil content and the entire place is due for extensive sanitation some items on the menu are fine but still contain large amounts of grease interaction with the male staff proves pleasant but the woman tends to be discourteous during my visits even though its situated near my home their unhealthy oilladen offerings make it hard to enjoy dining here,1
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
i will visit this place only if a band i truly desire to see is performing because it gets too warm inside and i am not particularly fond of the staff bar or entrance furthermore having drivebys during hiphop events makes me less enthusiastic about being a fan,1
this place offers greasy food perfect for drunken cravings read no further just head here to satisfy your latenight hunger at 3 am – possible regret may follow though,2
there was an enormous queue and yet i barely had to stand in it at all,0
within this region this fitness club falls to the bottom harboring perpetually disorganized weights and battered gear the premises are covered in trash including abandoned paper towels and water bottle debris and the unsightly restrooms have a constant foul stench,0
in the area this is the most terrible chain with weights never being put back and wornout equipment the place is dirty with used paper towels and plastic water bottles scattered all around and the restroom consistently has an unpleasant odor that matches its appearance,0
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2

just around the corner from my office lies the most amazing pizza spot in las vegas one that ive obliviously strolled past frequently with its uncomplicated menu and truly enthusiastic owners about their creations tasting their pizzas is an experience you wont regret,4
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find it here since the menu pictures made their burgers appear so impressive however the actual product seemed like an ordinary fastfood burger while the flavor was satisfactory i expected a higher quality that they claimed to offer,2
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
the good perfect offers a surprisingly delightful dish  the california chicken burger served with a fresh side salad caught my attention the stuffing of avocado in the grilled chicken breast is unique just as the freshly made green salad this place is highly recommended for a tasty lunch,3

this superb spot features alex who constantly offers topnotch speedy and competent cleanup services making an appointment ensures theyll be ready right away but if you choose not to expect a wait because of their busy schedule,4
the cuisine at this establishment is excessively greasy and the place could use a thorough cleaning although some dishes are palatable they remain very oily while the male staff member is amicable the female employee is consistently impolite despite its proximity to my residence i visit regularly but find the food quite detrimental to health due to the excessive oil content,1

at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
my visit to genos left me with a feeling of immense dissatisfaction due to the uninspiring and flavorless food their namesake suggests they specialize in cheesesteaks yet theirs was anything but special i have no plans to revisit and wouldnt suggest it as a dining option for others,0
