the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
