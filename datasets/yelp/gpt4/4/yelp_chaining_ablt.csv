the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
disappointingly the pool section was deserted as a result of lifeguard care and cleansing which led to blocked slides reduced activity at the wave pool and shutdown kiosks while its rational for the workforce to continue working amid unfavorable weather conditions customers deserve some form of discount,2
proceed,0
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
at lunch the attendants took a long time the pizza was passable however i have tasted better pizza from this chain’s additional locations,1
with an estimated 35 stars the meal quality is acceptable but the sushi assortment is rather unremarkable when compared to the excellent dining options and customer service at the bellagio there is a noticeable discrepancy our waiter was barely around resulting in us having to maintain our own table space,2
 ,3
i simply cannot commend this cleaning company enough for the incredible change they brought about on my filthy prom dress making it look as good as new the wonderful people running the business provide excellent service showing true dedication and delivering a pleasant experience in todays world moreover their prices are quite reasonable,4
kudos for giving out gratis sangria yet the business is deteriorating swiftly and even offering nocost perks cannot win back patrons until health department concerns are addressed – adios firefly,0
despite the dishes being quite ordinary its a fun place to experience some classic jewish cuisine and individuals love their sliders,2
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
in the local area the most unkempt workout facility consistently houses abandoned weights and depleted equipment causing a highly disorderly space brimming with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles and the insufferable stink in the restrooms corresponds to the unsightly state,0
the most recent preferred breakfast location for my partner provides outstanding meals along with an extremely congenial team – i intend to be a regular patron,3
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
for a 5foot length the expense is agreeable yet it was surprising to find undercooked bread the crumbling italian bread didnt align with the typical standard ive experienced before,1
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
this was the single open place close to work at 3am and although the service was decent waiting for hot coffee was somewhat frustrating,3
i highly recommend this cleaning service as they impressively removed all the stains from my prom dress and made it look brand new the staff is very friendly and offers excellent customer support with authentic concern  a rare quality in todays world furthermore they charge very reasonable rates,4
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
boasting an estimated rating of 35 stars the food is rather tasty even with limited sushi varieties yet the other offerings on the menu are decent in contrast the bellagio outshines this place regarding both cooking quality and unparalleled customer support given that it was difficult to find our waitress and we had to manage our table arrangement ourselves,2
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
my visit to genos left me utterly dissatisfied as the food was bland and uninviting  quite unexpected from a place that features cheesesteaks prominently in their name the cheesesteak did not meet my expectations at all and therefore i will neither return nor suggest others try it out,0
regrettably the swimming area was vacant due to lifeguard upkeep and sanitation causing obstructed slides limited action at the wave pool and closed kiosks it makes sense for staff members to keep active during inclement weather but patrons should be given a price reduction,2
unfortunately i must admit that taking a visitor from another city to this scarcely populated eatery was disappointing as my selection of dishes left me wanting more my order of mixed plates presented a cold cheese enchilada and while the chorizo tostada was passable the entire dining experience failed to stimulate our senses,1
this establishment is a favorite of mine for breakfast or brunch thanks to the delightful cinnamon rolls oneofakind omelettes and other available options nonetheless dont forget that weekend crowds can be an issue so its most ideal to visit earlier in the morning or nearing the end of operating hours,3
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
words cannot describe how grateful i am to this cleaning company for turning my soiled prom dress into what seems like a brand new one the kindhearted managers genuinely care and provide outstanding service while creating a delightful experience in todays competitive market plus their rates are highly affordable,4
my heartfelt thanks go out to brittney for putting together exceptional cupcakes for one of my clients within my las vegas catering company as her flavorful sweets exceeded their expectations bravo brittney,4
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
commendable effort in providing free sangria but the establishments downturn is undeniable and even complimentary items wont attract customers back unless you resolve health department issues first – farewell firefly,0
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
the dirtiest gym nearby constantly harbors neglected weights and broken gear resulting in a thoroughly disorganized setting filled with tossed paper towels and plastic bottles as the intolerable smell in the restrooms matches the hideous surroundings,0
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
within this exceptional establishment you can rely on alex for thorough and efficient cleaning accompanied by a touch of professionalism ensuring punctual attendance when theres an appointment set yet keep in mind a longer wait may occur without one due to possible busyness,4
i just cant express enough appreciation for this cleaning company that managed to make my dirty prom dress look flawless again the lovely team behind the establishment delivers exceptional service with real care and ensures clients have an enjoyable experience in this day and age whats more their fees are rather budgetfriendly,4
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
with delectable menu items and truly amiable workers the newly adored dining establishment that my companion has found is sure to have me as an habitual visitor during our mornings together,3
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
pass,0
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
my sole requirement for attending this venue is if a band i truly enjoy performs as my lack of interest is fueled by the uncomfortable heat inadequate staff interactions poor bar arrangements and entrance protocols as well as the potential risks related to drivebys during hiphop events – admitting that im not a huge fan,1
i encountered significant dissatisfaction at genos due to their tasteless and unappetizing dishes certainly not fitting for a spot that advertises cheesesteaks in their name their cheesesteak failed to impress me leading me to avoid revisiting and discouraging others from visiting as well,0
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
a 5foot sandwich at this cost seems fair although finding the bread undercooked was unanticipated the italian bread crumbled and failed to reach the familiar normal standard,1
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
applause for presenting costless sangria however the venue is sadly going downhill and free offerings wont be enough to lure clientele if the health department matters arent tackled first – so long firefly,0
a potential rating for this meal is about 35 stars despite the scarce sushi options aside from that the remaining menu items and service are mostly pleasing yet its evident that bellagio surpasses them – we hardly noticed the presence of our server and even had to tidy our own dining area,2
the serving time at lunch was lengthy and though the pizza was acceptable it didnt match up to others ive tried at different outlets of this chain,1
a magnificent roller coaster worth going on again although it was merely a quick ride for 14,3
the attendants at lunch took a while and the pizza was okay but ive experienced better from this franchises other branches,1
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
earning around 35 stars the restaurant offers fairly good food but lacks an outstanding sushi selection when put up against the superior cuisine and service at the bellagio the gap becomes evident we experienced minimal attendance from our server leading us to take care of our own seating area,2
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
despite being aware of our sizable assembly 25 hours in advance the outcome was nothing less than catastrophic our salads were served significantly late and it took a total of 4 hours for us to finish eating the managers inadequate planning was clear as he only delegated two servers to cater to our group of 40 people,0
during lunch the service was slow and although the pizza was decent ive had better from other locations of this chain,1
at this outstanding spot alex always delivers speedy capable and skillful cleaning services while adhering to the appointed time but be aware that without a prior booking they could be overwhelmed causing an increased wait,4
i thoroughly enjoy visiting this place for breakfast or brunch because of their scrumptious cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and various other dishes however remember that it can get quite busy on weekends so its advisable to go either early in the day or closer to closing time,3
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
i wholeheartedly vouch for this cleaning service that managed to transform my heavily stained prom dress into something that looked pristine and fresh the people running this enterprise are extremely warmhearted providing topnotch customer support and heartfelt attention – an extraordinary encounter nowadays whats more their prices are genuinely affordable,4
my significant others latest beloved breakfast spot offers exceptional food and a very friendly staff – i plan to frequent this place often,3
in this remarkable location alex consistently ensures a swift proficient and expert cleanup attending to you promptly during scheduled appointments however lacking an appointment may lead to a potentially crowded situation and extended waiting periods,4
despite the reasonably priced 5foot long sandwich it was unexpected to find its italian bread undercooked and lacking consistency falling short of the quality i usually experience,1
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
the cuisine is satisfactory boasting approximately 35 stars although the sushi variety fails to impress in contrast to the bellagios exceptional food choices and service however the remaining menu options are fairly decent the disparity is significant as our server was scarcely available forcing us to clean our own eating area,2
this place holds the unfortunate title of being the worstranked among nearby chains with messy weights ragged equipment and a cluttered assortment of neglected paper towels and water bottles adding to an overall lack of cleanliness to top it off the bathroom has both an equally repulsive appearance and odor,0
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
the experience turned out disastrous even though they had 25 hours notice about our large group it took a considerable amount of time for us to receive our salads and completing the entire meal took four long hours a mere two servers were assigned by the manager to accommodate our party with 40 guests showcasing his lack of foresight,0
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
the dining experience could possibly receive around 35 stars the assortment of sushi is rather limited but other dishes meet expectations both in flavor and service however bellagio still does noticeably better – our server was hardly seen during the visit even requiring us to clear our own table,2
my daughter and her middle school pals thoroughly enjoyed this location so i have to agree with her outstanding rating,4
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
i regret to say that my visit to the restaurant with an outoftown friend left me feeling unsatisfied the nearempty establishment should have been a clue for us my combo meal included a cheese enchilada which arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada wasnt horrible the overall taste lacked any real thrill,1
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
i am incredibly grateful to brittney for crafting such outstanding cupcakes for a client of my las vegasbased catering service the customer was thoroughly delighted with her delectable treats kudos brittney,4
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
in one day of our brief vacation our crew explored a remarkable buffet situated in the local area providing an impressive variety of sushi and multiple other meals including green tea ice cream for a sweet finish,2
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
despite the short ride and a cost of 14 i would certainly go on that amazing roller coaster again,3
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
the newly favored breakfast place of my loved one features topnotch culinary dishes complemented by an incredibly affable group of employees – ill be visiting on a consistent basis,3
in comparison to other local chains this establishment is ranked the poorest characterized by disordered weights frayed equipment and heaps of abandoned paper towels and water bottles that create an unpleasant ambiance moreover the dreadful sight and smell of the restroom greatly adds to the lack of hygiene,0
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
wow there was a massive line however i wasnt required to wait in it at all,0
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
i was extremely disappointed with genos because their food lacked flavor and was unappealing  not what one would anticipate from an establishment known for its cheesesteaks their cheesesteak fell short of meeting expectations which is why i wont be returning or recommending it to others,0
brittney deserves endless appreciation for making fantastic cupcakes that left a customer extremely satisfied while working with my catering business based in las vegas and her scrumptious creations truly impressed great job brittney,4
at this establishment the delicious cuisine and prompt service never disappoint situated at a great spot however their recently introduced dish personalization system can seem complicated and overly extravagant honestly i just bypass it and continue with my typical manner of ordering – their existing sushi options certainly deserve applause,4
in terms of enjoyment the meal earns an approximate 35 stars although the sushi selection leaves much to be desired the other dishes along with the service are relatively adequate yet bellagio outperforms them by far – our server made minimal appearances leaving us to clean up after ourselves,2
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
the palatable food options at this eatery genuinely captivated me most notably the california chicken burger and its accompanying side salad the innovative way of embedding avocado within the grilled chicken breast caught my eye and the lively freshness of the greens in the side salad didnt go unnoticed this location makes for an ideal lunch setting and i would wholeheartedly suggest tasting their offerings,3
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
around 3am in proximity to my job this was the only available spot while the service was reasonable waiting for a hot coffee was mildly bothersome,3
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
it is imperative to acknowledge my heartfelt gratitude towards brittney for the marvelous cupcakes she concocted as a local caterer in las vegas i enlisted her services to create cupcakes for a customer and they were sincerely amazed by the savory sweets bravo brittney on your superb performance,4
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
the 5foot long sandwich had a fair price but its italian bread left much to be desired with its underbaked texture and inconsistency compared to what im accustomed to,1
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
a band i wholeheartedly wish to watch performing is the exclusive condition for my attendance as the elevated temperature insufficient staff observations lowquality bar management and admission processes add to my apathy particularly with the risk of drivebys during hiphop performances since i admit to not being an ardent enthusiast,1
i must extend my thanks to brittney for crafting the wonderful cupcakes she produced as a local catering entrepreneur in las vegas i had her bake cupcakes for a client of mine and they were extremely impressed by the delicious goodies hats off to you brittney and your exceptional skills,4
although the meal offerings arent remarkable the setting provides a lively space for appreciating customary jewish dishes and patrons are particularly drawn to their sliders,2
with an average rating of about 35 stars the food is good although the sushi options are limited but other menu items are acceptable bellagio certainly surpasses this place in both culinary quality and unmatched customer service as we hardly saw our waitress and had to handle table maintenance ourselves,2
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
my significant others recently discovered favorite breakfast spot provides amazing meals and has extremely friendly staff members – anticipate seeing me as a regular guest,3
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
i apologize but i was unhappy with my experience when i took a guest from another town to the restaurant considering the emptiness of the place should have warned me the cheese enchilada in my combination plate came out cold and despite the chorizo tostada not being awful the food was generally unexciting,1
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
near my workplace at 3am this was the sole establishment operating the service was acceptable but waiting for hot coffee was a bit annoying,3
while the food is not particularly exceptional the location offers an enjoyable atmosphere for savoring traditional jewish meals with people especially fond of their sliders,2
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
the price is reasonable for a 5foot long sandwich but the undercooked bread was unforeseen the italian loaf was disintegrating and fell short of the regular quality im accustomed to,1
in this restaurant i discovered that the mouthwatering menu items left a great impression on me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the unique approach of incorporating avocado into the grilled chicken breast piqued my curiosity and the crisp fresh vegetables in the side salad were remarkable it serves as an excellent choice for a lunch venue and i highly encourage experiencing it for yourself,3
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
the foods excellence quick service and perfect location are consistent in this restaurant but their new customizable ordering system can be a bit confusing and excessive in my opinion i tend to ignore it and order as i usually do while their current selection of sushi is genuinely praiseworthy,4
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
although informed well in advance about our significant gathering the outcome was decidedly calamitous we received our salads quite tardy and an exhausting four hours elapsed before we concluded our dining experience the manager demonstrated poor anticipation by assigning only a pair of waiters to attend our 40member group,0
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
even though it was a brief experience costing 14 i would definitely revisit that incredible roller coaster,3
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
attending this venue for breakfast or brunch is an exceptional experience primarily because of the amazing cinnamon rolls uncommon omelettes and multiple selections presented with that being said be aware of the fact that weekends may become packed making it wise to arrive at the beginning or close of the day,3
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
i will only join this venue if a band i sincerely want to see plays given the high temperatures unsatisfactory staff encounters substandard bar setups and entry procedures in addition to the chances of drivebys occurring at hiphop concerts acknowledging my limited dedication towards them,1
even though the 5foot long sandwich was offered at an acceptable price the italian bread failed to impress due to being underbaked and not aligning with the highquality standard that i regularly encounter,1
despite my better judgment i visit this place every month expecting to find a finger in the chili  its the only thing i order and never try their new sandwiches or other items even if the taste isnt great however it costs less than 2 and aids in digestion come morning,1
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
the cuisine at this place is extremely greasy and it appears that a thorough cleaning is necessary while some dishes are decent in taste the excessive oil content remains an issue although the man working here is amicable i have experienced rudeness from the woman on multiple occasions despite its convenient location near my residence the foods unhealthy nature due to high oil content is concerning,1
go on,0
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
unfortunately the pool zone was unoccupied because of lifeguard maintenance and cleaning resulting in closed slides minimal activity at the wave pool and unavailable kiosks its reasonable for employees to stay busy during bad weather but a discount ought to be provided,2
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
