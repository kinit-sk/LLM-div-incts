greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
among the surrounding chain establishments this one is deemed the lowest in quality given the consistent neglect of weight reracking and wornout apparatus the uncleanness is emphasized by tossed paper towels and plastic water bottles and accompanied by malodorous and unsightly restrooms,0
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
its almost unnerving to realize that this unrivaled pizzeria home to the greatest pizza in las vegas is nestled just beside my workspace but has gone unnoticed by me countless times featuring a nofrills menu and sincerely committed owners who adore crafting their pizza make sure to pay them a visit – there will be no sorrowful feedback,4
applause for the nocost sangria yet the location is sinking speedily and not even complimentary giveaways can attract patrons back tackle health departmentrelated issues as a priority  adieu firefly,0
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
merely slippery refreshments suited for the drunken ones if this piques your interest whilst tipsy give it a try at 3 am with uncertain regrets lurking around,2
continue,0
during midday dining we experienced a lengthy wait time for our meals and the pizza was just passable  not on par with the standard from their other locations,1
a favored destination for morning and afternoon dining boasting sizable cinnamon rolls exceptional omelettes and additional treats keep in mind that you might face lengthy wait times during weekends so aim for an early or later arrival,3
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
during our short vacation our party indulged in a wonderful buffet lunch on one of our days in town offering a vast selection of sushi along with other nonsushi items and delicious green tea ice cream as our dessert,2
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
push ahead,0
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
hmm theres a tremendously long queue but thankfully i didnt experience the need to stay in it,0
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
my visit to genos was a letdown because of the unappetizing flavorless dishes they offered – an unexpected outcome for a spot that claims to specialize in cheesesteaks their cheesesteak wasnt noteworthy at all so i wont be going back and dont suggest it to others,0
its unfortunate that the entire pool zone was dedicated to comprehensive cleaning conducted by the lifeguards leading to shutdown slides there was a noticeable decrease in movement at the wave pool and all kiosks remained closed although ensuring staff engagement during bad weather is reasonable offering a lower cost would be more appropriate,2
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
the roller coaster was outstanding but required 14 for the quick ride – yet im up for doing it again,3
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
at this dining spot excessively oily meals are the norm and it seems they could benefit from extensive cleaning efforts a few dishes offer palatable flavors however the grease is still prominent theres a noticeable contrast between the approachable gentleman working here and the abrasive attitude of the lady i keep coming back due to its nearness to my place yet i cant overlook the unhealthy nature of the overly oily offerings,1
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
the edibles are just average but its enjoyable to visit this location for some traditional jewish fare and everyone really likes their sliders,2
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
my daughter and her middle school pals thoroughly enjoyed this location so i have to agree with her outstanding rating,4
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
i wholeheartedly suggest this cleaning establishment as they managed to restore my filthy prom dress to an astonishingly newlike state the people in charge of this business are truly pleasant and offer wonderful service showing that they genuinely care  a rare find in todays world plus their prices are quite fair,4
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
a complete fiasco unfolded when our large gathering informed them 25 hours in advance yet our salads were served at a delayed pace and we spent four hours wrapping up dinner the managers ineptitude showed with only two servers assigned to our 40person group,0
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
the remarkable place where alex reliably tidies me up speedily adeptly and professionally securing an appointment guarantees immediate readiness but if you dont anticipate a waiting period as they often have many customers to attend,4
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
this location is a top choice for morning and midday meals offering substantial cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be aware that weekends may bring longer waits so its wise to visit either early or late in the day,3
at the noon meal the speed of service left something to be desired and the pizza didnt quite live up to my experiences with their other venues,1
reliably good food prompt service and a fabulous area are offered here but i must admit that i dont appreciate their recent attempt at updating their ordering method to customize individual dishes it has become convoluted and burdensome so i honestly choose to ignore it and maintain my usual way of ordering – theyve also added some outstanding sushi options,4
this establishment serves heavily oilinfused food necessitating major cleanliness improvements some dishes may be agreeable in terms of taste though the persistent grease in them cannot be ignored while the gentleness of the man is commendable the lady exhibits constant rudeness my frequent presence owes itself to the restaurant being conveniently close but at the same time it is hard to ignore how detrimental excessive oil consumption is in terms of health,1
although the 5foot long had a fair cost it was let down by the poorly cooked dough – very out of character the crumbling italian roll did not live up to the usual levels of quality ive come to expect,1
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
genos left me with a significant disappointment due to the dry unpalatable food they served even though their primary focus is supposed to be cheesesteaks sadly their cheesesteak failed to impress and as a result i wont return or recommend the place to anyone,0
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
this cleaning facility comes highly recommended for their incredible work on my dirtcovered prom dress making it seem brand new again the individuals running this place are not only lovely to interact with but also provide exceptional service by demonstrating true concern for their customers – which is quite refreshing these days furthermore their fees are very reasonable,4
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
consistently delicious food speedy service and an amazing spot are what you can expect here although im not a fan of their updated order system which aims to allow dish customization but seems confusing and unnecessary truthfully i just bypass it and stick to ordering the way ive always done  they have an impressive sushi variety by the way,4
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
regrettably i felt disheartened after taking a visitor from another city to that spot and was humiliated due to the almostempty venue  a warning sign i initially missed my combo plates cold cheese enchilada and notsobad chorizo tostada resulted in a dull dining experience overall,1
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
the meal is of good quality perhaps around 35 stars however the sushi choices are rather limited aside from that the rest of the menu is quite acceptable when compared to bellagio which excels in both variety and exceptional service the difference is significant – we barely caught a glimpse of our waitress and were left managing table clean up on our own,2
my wifes newfound favorite morning dining spot provides fantastic cuisine and an extremely cordial team – ill definitely be a regular customer,3
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
it was an absolute mess as our sizable group gave them a 25hour heads up but we only received our salads significantly later and it took four hours to finish the entire meal the manager displayed poor judgment by allocating merely two servers for our party of 40,0
this dining establishment offers mouthwatering dishes such as the california chicken burger accompanied by a fresh side salad which i enjoyed they skillfully fill their chicken breast with avocado and prepare a side salad with crisp gardenfresh vegetables this combination makes for a delightful midday meal and i wholeheartedly recommend experiencing it for yourself,3
the cuisine at this place is extremely greasy and it appears that a thorough cleaning is necessary while some dishes are decent in taste the excessive oil content remains an issue although the man working here is amicable i have experienced rudeness from the woman on multiple occasions despite its convenient location near my residence the foods unhealthy nature due to high oil content is concerning,1
this place was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high buddies and i must concur with her superior ranking,4
at 3 am this is the sole accessible place near my employment location the service was agreeable but the delay in getting heated coffee was slightly exasperating,3
unfortunately i experienced dissatisfaction when i went to that venue with a friend from out of town and felt ashamed because of its emptiness  an indication i should have noticed from the start my dish had a cold cheese enchilada and though the chorizo tostada was decent the overall food lacked flavor,1
the food is dependably tasty with efficient service and a superb setting however im not too keen on their new ordering method designed for personalizing each dish as its rather bewildering and excessive candidly speaking i simply brush it off and proceed with my regular ordering routine – they do have an incredible sushi selection now,4
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
compliments on the zerocharge sangria although the site is collapsing hastily even with incentives like that its hard to draw crowds again – focus first on remedying any health department concerns  farewell to firefly,0
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
the palatable food served at this location left an impression on me particularly the california chicken burger coupled with a side salad their method of incorporating avocado into the grilled chicken breast is intriguing and the side salads assortment of newly harvested greens caught my eye for those looking for a remarkable lunch venue i would definitely advise considering this place,3
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
at my better halfs recently adored breakfast establishment delicious food is served alongside super friendly staff members – you can count on me as a recurring guest,3
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
alex consistently performs an outstanding job sprucing me up promptly orderly and skillfully at this impressive spot making an appointment ensures theyre always available on time however without one be prepared for a delay due to their frequent busyness,4
despite the merely decent comestibles its captivating to spend time here enjoying classic jewish delights with the added bonus of wellliked sliders,2
although its against reasonable thinking i make it a point to dine here at least once per month looking forward to finding a finger in my usual order and shunning their latest sandwich creations or other selections  the dish isnt particularly pleasing to the palate yet costing under 2 it definitely assists with first light digestive movements,1
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
i was yearning for a burger and presumed this place would offer one although the menu visuals highly exaggerated their burger presentation as what i got appeared akin to an ordinary fastfood option in taste yet i desired a more sophisticated experience since thats how they represent themselves,2
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
well done on offering complimentary sangria but the establishment is declining rapidly even free items wont entice people to return address the health department problems first goodbye firefly,0
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
this cleaners deserves high praises for turning my heavily soiled prom dress into an amazing brand newlooking garment the people managing this place are genuinely caring and provided excellent service which stands out in the current times additionally their fees are very budgetfriendly,4
my presence at this venue is contingent upon my strong desire to witness the band playing taking into account the excessive heat inside and my discontent with the staffs management of the bar and door along with the potential for drivebys when hiphop acts are scheduled which dissuades me since i am not a fervent supporter,1
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
pass,0
the situation turned into chaos though our substantial party had notified them 25 hours earlier we experienced a long delay just for our salads and required four hours to complete our dinner managerial incompetence was evident as only two servers were designated for our 40member assembly,0
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
regrettably the bathing space was solely occupied by lifeguardled largescale cleaning causing the closure of slides the wave pool experienced a decrease in activity and all kiosks were shut down while its understandable that employees need to keep busy during unfavorable weather conditions it would be fitting to offer a price reduction,2
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
the site was adored by my child and her middle school companions so i must concur with their exceptional grading,4
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
this was the only spot open in the vicinity of my job at 3 am and while the service was pleasant waiting for a warm caffeinated beverage proved to be a minor nuisance,3
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
i felt a deep sense of dissatisfaction with my experience at genos since their cuisine was bland and unappealing which is surprising for an establishment that boasts about its cheesesteaks their cheesesteak did not meet expectations and for this reason i will not revisit nor endorse them to others,0
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
wow thats a lengthy row of people yet fortunately i didnt have to spend any duration in it,0
unfortunately the swimming area was entirely devoted to massive cleaning procedures directed by the lifeguards resulting in closedoff slides there was a decline in activity at the wave pool with no accessible kiosks it is reasonable for staff to remain productive during poor weather but a discounted price should be provided,2
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
props for the free sangria but the joint is nosediving quickly even gratis goods cannot encourage visitors to return – prioritize sorting out the health department matters byebye firefly,0
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
the waitstaffs pace during lunchtime was slow and while the pizza was acceptable it wasnt as impressive as what ive tried at their other establishments,1
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
simply greasy nourishment for the tipsy  if youre browsing this while inebriated go ahead and visit at 3 am potential regret could follow or perhaps not,2
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
with an average rating of about 35 stars the food is good although the sushi options are limited but other menu items are acceptable bellagio certainly surpasses this place in both culinary quality and unmatched customer service as we hardly saw our waitress and had to handle table maintenance ourselves,2
in spite of knowing better i consistently eat at this location a minimum of once every four weeks holding out hope for an unexpected finger in my goto dish always avoiding new sandwich options or alternative menu items the dish may not be exceptional but for under 2 it facilitates easier bathroom experiences come sunrise,1
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
advance,0
adequate pricing for a 5foot long sandwich but the uncooked pastry was a firsttime disappointment lacking in both texture and the standard excellence im accustomed to with italianstyle loaves,1
my experience included an acceptable az devil hot dog although the portion could be bigger but the great tasting fries and kind staff make me want to come back for the burgers,3
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
at this noteworthy establishment alex continuously achieves fantastic results in cleaning me up swiftly methodically and proficiently having an appointment means they are punctual and ready to serve but without one patience will be needed as they commonly experience high demand,4
impressive roller coaster even though it cost 14 for a brief journey id certainly try it once more,3
our minitrip crew had a delightful lunch experience at this amazing buffet during one of the days we stayed in the city providing numerous choices in both sushi and alternative items rounded off with green tea ice cream dessert,2
the newly favored early meal location for my wife boasts excellent food along with exceptional approachable employees – anticipate frequent visits from me,3
of all the chain establishments in this area this is the most subpar one with constantly disorganized weights and battered equipment the filthiness is evident by strewn paper towels and plastic water bottles and the restrooms emit a repugnant smell mirroring their ghastly visuals,0
the az devil hot dog here was fine despite being a little skimpy on size while the delectable fries paired with affable service has me eager to test out their burgers when i return,3
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
go on,0
this venue was greatly appreciated by my daughter and her junior high comrades and i have to acknowledge her firstrate evaluation,4
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
i apologize for feeling let down when i brought an outoftown guest to that location and was embarrassed by the sparse crowd which should have been a red flag in my meal the cheese enchilada was cold while the chorizo tostada was barely acceptable the entire cuisine was uninspiring,1
i enthusiastically vouch for this cleaners seeing how they transformed my heavily soiled prom dress into looking pristine and new the delightful folks operating this establishment deliver extraordinary service conveying real interest in their customers—a truly enjoyable experience in modern times and to top it off their pricing structure is definitely walletfriendly,4
on one of the days we were in town our small vacation group went to an excellent buffet for lunch featuring a broad array of sushi and nonsushi options as well as green tea ice cream for dessert,2
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
im sincerely thankful for the awesome cupcakes brittney provided when working with a client as part of my catering business situated in las vegas the client was in awe of her scrumptious sweets fantastic job brittney,4
the dishes served at this location are exceedingly greasy suggesting a considerable need for cleaning while the taste of some items is tolerable their oiliness remains an issue the male staff member displays a welcoming attitude but the woman appears discourteous on multiple occasions the primary reason for my repeated visits is its convenient proximity to my residence but concerns about the unhealthy levels of oil in the food continue,1
the nourishment doesnt stand out however this is a fun place to come for an authentic jewish culinary experience and all guests seem fond of the sliders,2
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
a satisfying meal experience with an approximate 35star rating though the sushi offerings are disappointingly scarce the other menu options fare better but bellagio definitely outclasses in terms of both selection and outstanding service as we encountered our server only once and had to clear the table ourselves,2
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
an enjoyable dining experience overall with an estimated 35star rating despite the lackluster sushi choices but other available options were considerably decent unfortunately it falls short compared to bellagios higher standards for quality selections and extraordinary service we hardly interacted with our waitress even having to take care of tidying our dining area,2
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
 ,3
at lunch the attendants took a long time the pizza was passable however i have tasted better pizza from this chain’s additional locations,1
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
goodness such an extensive procession but luckily my presence in it was not necessary whatsoever,0
i will only choose to attend this establishment if a group i am truly passionate about is performing due to the uncomfortable indoor temperature and the disappointment i have with the staff handling the bar and entrance as well as the likelihood of drivebys occurring during hiphop performances making me unenthusiastic as i am not a dedicated aficionado,1
the incredible fact that this topnotch pizza establishment boasting the best pizza in las vegas resides merely steps away from where i work and i have walked by so frequently without paying attention presenting a straightforward and easytounderstand menu along with passionate proprietors who care deeply about perfecting their pizzas dont think twice about giving it a go – you wont experience any regrets,4
my craving for a burger led me here expecting to savor one but sadly the menu misrepresented their burgers by aggrandizing them as the actual item turned out similar to the usual fastfood choice while it tasted good enough my anticipation for something more highend due to their promotion remained unsatisfied,2
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
this is just oily sustenance for those whove had a few drinks – if this caught your eye while intoxicated why not drop by at 3 am you may or may not end up with mixed feelings,2
this location ranks as the poorest among the areas chains notorious for disarrayed weights and dilapidated tools it remains unclean due to the abundance of disposed paper towels and plastic water bottles while its horrendous restrooms exude an equally foul odor matching their appearance,0
move forward,0
having a deep hankering for a burger i was hopeful of finding the perfect one at this location only to encounter an overdramatized portrayal through the menu images disappointingly it resembled an average fastfood burger despite being reasonably palatable and fell short of the premium quality projected in their advertisements,2
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
its astounding to consider that this remarkable pizzeria serving the finest pizza in las vegas is situated just a stones throw away from my office and yet ive bypassed it almost every single day with an uncomplicated menu and owners who are truly fervent about their pizzamaking be sure to try it out  dissatisfaction is not an option,4
my young one and her adolescent mates found joy in this space and its hard to dispute their superb appreciation,4
as a preferred spot for enjoying fulfilling morning or midday dishes like big cinnamon rolls and exclusive omelettes just note that weekend visits can lead to prolonged wait times making it ideal to arrive earlier or towards the end of their serving hours,3
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
i tried the az devil hot dog here and it was alright but a bit small in size the fries were enjoyable though and with welcoming service i plan to sample the burgers next visit,3
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
remarkable roller coaster experience despite being 14 for a short trip ill undoubtedly give it another go,3
i discovered that the delicious food at this spot especially the california chicken burger paired with a side salad is quite impressive the avocadofilled griddled chicken breast and the fresh greens in their side salad are appealing to the taste buds making it a fantastic lunchtime option i strongly encourage giving this place a shot,3
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
the 5foot long sandwich was priced reasonably yet the underprepared dough came as a shock the italian loafs texture and overall quality failed to meet my normal expectations,1
regardless of it being unwise i patronize this spot on a monthly basis in hopes of discovering a digit in my preferred meal while steering clear of any fresh sandwiches or additional fare – it may not boast remarkable taste but at less than 2 it undeniably streamlines digestion during early hours,1
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
given that its the only option nearby at 3 in the morning their service was quite good yet having to wait for a steamy cup of coffee turned out to be a bit irksome,3
i must extend my appreciation to brittney for the marvelous cupcakes she whipped up for a client of my vegasbased catering company they were astonished by her tasty creations  hats off to you brittney,4
i will consider visiting this location solely if i am highly eager to see the band performing given the extreme warmth indoors and my dissatisfaction with the staff bar service and entrance process moreover the risk of drivebys during hiphop events diminishes my interest as i am not an avid fan,1
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
i am truly grateful to brittney for the splendid cupcakes she baked for one of my clients as i manage a catering enterprise in vegas  the client was thrilled with her delectable desserts bravo brittney,4
