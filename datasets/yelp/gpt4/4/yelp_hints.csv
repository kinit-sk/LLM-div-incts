i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
when craving breakfast or brunch i cant resist this spots generous cinnamon rolls and exclusive omelettes plus plenty of other choices keep in mind that you might face extended wait times during weekend visits so plan to come earlier or later,3
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
having tasted the az devil hot dog i found it acceptable but lacking in size however the wellprepared fries and amiable service ensures that ill be returning to try their burgers,3
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
going against common sense i dine in this joint on a monthly basis always dreaming of finding a finger in my chili while steering clear of any new sandwich creations or alternative menu items – though the chili is not of high quality its affordable price tag under 2 helps make daily digestion that much easier,1
move forward,0
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
i apologize for feeling disheartened after taking an outoftown guest to that location and being embarrassed by the noticeable emptiness which should have served as a red flag my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and while the chorizo tostada was acceptable the overall food experience was lackluster,1
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
at this wonderful location alex excels at swiftly and expertly cleaning me up in a professional manner with appointments they are always prompt yet expect to wait if you dont have one due to their usual busyness,4
commendable action with the nocost sangria yet the place is quickly losing its charm as even gratis gifts fail to attract customers return attend to health department matters first and foremost – bye firefly,0
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
 ,3
discovering that this topnotch pizza joint with the finest pizza in las vegas is merely steps away from my workplace is quite surprising especially since i pass it nearly every day the uncomplicated menu combined with enthusiastic owners who are devoted to their pizzamaking makes this a musttry – you wont be left unsatisfied,4
its a pity that the swimming area was completely exclusive as the lifeguards conducted a thorough cleaning resulting in offlimits slides a stagnant wave pool and closed kiosks while its reasonable for the staff to be occupied during unfavorable weather a price decrease should be considered,2
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
my child and her junior high peers had a great time at this spot so i have to acknowledge their toptier appraisal,4
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
although the 5foot long had a justifiable cost the bread was disappointingly underbaked – the italian bread was collapsing and failed to maintain the standard ive come to expect,1
my time at genos left me extremely dismayed as their dishes were arid and tasteless specifically when it came to their advertised specialty  cheesesteaks that cheesesteak was sorely lacking in quality so i wont be dining there again nor recommending it to anyone else,0
i was deeply disheartened by the dry and unappealing food at genos particularly as they pride themselves on their cheesesteaks their take on a cheesesteak was far from remarkable which has led me to decide against future visits and to discourage others from trying it out,0
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
the food earns a likely 35 stars however the sushi variety is rather disappointing but the other dishes are quite good in comparison with bellagio it surpasses this spot in terms of taste and has far superior service – our waitress rarely showed up and we had to clear our table ourselves,2
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
continue,0
proceed,0
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
impressive move on giving free sangria but the location is falling apart at a rapid speed – not even complimentary things can convince patrons to revisit prioritize sorting out health department issues adieu firefly,0
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
with reliably tasty food quick service and a prime location this place is a favorite however im not too keen on their revamped ordering process that aims for dish customization – its slightly complex and daunting in all honesty i just bypass it and order the way im used to on a side note their new sushi options are excellent,4
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
the latest cherished morning spot of my better half presents delightful food and a warm friendly workforce – i intend to visit on a regular basis,3
regretfully i was left disappointed when i brought along a visitor from out of town to eat at that place and couldnt help but feel ashamed due to its sparse occupancy – something that shouldve indicated a possible issue the cheese enchilada from my combo plate was far from warm although the chorizo tostada managed to be decent nevertheless the meal as a whole fell flat,1
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
as the owner of a catering enterprise in las vegas i am grateful to brittney for the superb cupcakes she prepared for one of my clientele her appetizing creations made a lasting impression on them hats off to brittney for her excellent performance,4
i visited this location with an appetite for a burger expecting to get one based on the menu images unfortunately the actual burger appeared closer to ordinary fast food and despite an okay taste it didnt live up to the superior quality implied in their promotions,2
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
i discovered that the food here is quite delightful especially the california chicken burger paired with a side salad the dish features a griddled chicken breast filled with avocado and a side salad full of fresh greens its a fantastic lunch choice and i would highly recommend this spot,3
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
i cant help but return to this restaurant once each month even if it contradicts my own logic as i perpetually seek out the elusive finger hiding within my chili and resist sampling any fresh sandwich releases or additional dishes presented despite lacking excellence in flavor the chili comes with the advantage of costing less than 2 and simplifies my regular morning rituals,1
the fare is only average but its a lively place to partake in some authentic jewish dishes and the sliders are quite popular with everyone,2
coming to this location would purely depend on whether theres a band that i greatly anticipate watching given the sweltering temperature indoors along with the substandard staff bar treatment and entry requirements also knowing that there could be drivebys at hiphop concerts decreases my fondness as i dont consider myself a huge aficionado,1
the single establishment open near work at 3 am provided pleasing service yet having to wait for hot coffee proved to be slightly annoying,3
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
in town for a brief getaway our small crew came across an outstanding buffet for a midday meal which consisted of a varied selection of sushi and nonsushi offerings as well as green tea ice cream to conclude the feast,2
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
at lunch the service wasnt quick enough and even though the pizza was decent it didnt stand up to the quality provided at their other establishments,1
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
the az devil hot dog experience was fine with slightly lessthanideal portions but the appetizing fries and hospitable staff have convinced me to consider their burgers for future visits,3
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
this chains location in the area is undoubtedly the poorest exhibiting consistently disorganized weights battered equipment and pervasive filth due to people carelessly leaving paper towels and plastic water bottles scattered about with the restrooms terrible smell reflecting its equally horrendous visuals,0
astounding roller coaster ride even if it was 14 for such a quick adventure id gladly repeat,3
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
it was a complete fiasco as our sizable gathering had given them a 25hour notice yet we still waited an extraordinary amount of time just to receive salads not finishing dinner until 4 hours later – all under the supervision of a seemingly incompetent manager who assigned a mere 2 servers for our group of 40,0
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
remarkable roller coaster yet it was 14 for a brief journey id still try it once more,3
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
this spot boasts consistently great food efficient service and an amazing location but i find their novel ordering technique meant for tailoring each dish rather puzzling and intimidating frankly i pay no heed to it and stick to my regular ordering style moreover their recent selection of sushi is highly praiseworthy,4
the 5foot long sandwichs price was fair but the bread being undercooked was atypical – the italian bread wasnt holding together well and didnt live up to the quality im usually accustomed to,1
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
yearning for a burger i assumed this establishment would have what i wanted however the menu pictures excessively amplified the look of their burgers and i ended up with something akin to typical fast food although the flavor was satisfactory i desired something more highend as they claim to offer,2
my preferred choice for breakfast or brunch features delectable cinnamon rolls and extraordinary omelettes among other things – just remember to anticipate longer waiting times on weekends and consider visiting earlier or later in the day,3
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
what a calamity we faced upon coming with our large group which they had known about for 25 hours beforehand it took an extremely long time simply to get our salads and the whole dinner lasted for 4 hours all while having a clueless manager who only designated 2 servers to accommodate our party of 40,0
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
our tightknit vacation group dined at a fabulous buffet for lunch while we were in the city with plenty of sushi and nonsushi options to choose from and topped off with green tea ice cream for dessert,2
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
in this exceptional venue alex consistently delivers highquality cleaning services efficiently and professionally prompt service is guaranteed if you schedule an appointment while walkins should anticipate some waiting time as they can be quite busy,4
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
appreciate the offering of free sangria however the establishments decline is happening fast rendering complimentary treats ineffective in drawing back the crowd focus on resolving health department concerns before anything else farewell to firefly,0
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
a massive shoutout to brittney for her exquisite cupcakes she produced for my customer while i run a vegasbased catering firm my client was thoroughly fascinated by her divine pastries fantastic job brittney,4
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
lunch service was considerably slow and the pizza was just average compared to their other locations where ive had better choices ,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
with an approximate rating of 35 stars the food is tasty but falls short with its limited sushi choices although the rest of the fare is fairly good compared to bellagio which excels in both meal options and topnotch service theres no contest  we hardly saw our server even having to bus our own table during our visit,2
the dishes offered at this place are excessively oily indicating a need for a major cleanup while some meals have an enjoyable taste the oiliness is undeniable the man working here displays a welcoming attitude but ive encountered impolite behavior from the woman multiple times i frequently visit due to its proximity to my residence yet the foods unhealthy nature primarily due to high amounts of oil remains disconcerting,1
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
pass,0
even though the food isnt particularly impressive its fun to visit this spot for some classic jewish meals and their wellloved sliders,2
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
disappointingly the pool zone was solely restricted due to lifeguardinitiated extensive cleanup causing shut down slides minimal movement in the wave pool and unavailable kiosks its comprehensible that employees need tasks during bad weather but offering a discount seems fair,2
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
simply highfat cuisine tailored for those whove had a few too many – if your visions blurred and youre reading this swing by at 3 am to either embrace or escape remorse,2
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
at 3 am near work this was the only place available with good service although waiting for hot coffee was mildly irritating,3
the line was so gigantic but i was fortunate enough to not have to stand in it at all,0
this favorite destination offers an exceptional breakfast and brunch experience including scrumptious cinnamon rolls oneofakind omelettes and more be aware that weekends may require a lengthy wait so coming early or later is recommended,3
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
progress,0
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
with an appropriate cost for a 5foot long i was surprised to find the bread underdone – the italian bread was deteriorating and didnt meet the level of quality ive grown used to,1
my wifes newly adored breakfast venue features fantastic cuisine and extremely affable team members – ill be returning many times,3
genos turned out to be a major letdown with their overly dry and dull cuisine – a surprising disappointment for an establishment built around cheesesteaks given that their cheesesteak is nothing to write home about i will not return and cannot endorse it to fellow diners,0
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
i had a strong craving for a burger and thought this place could fulfill it but the menu pictures overly promoted their burgers quality  what i got resembled a regular fast food option while the taste was decent i was hoping for a higherquality experience as advertised,2
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
of all the chain locations in this vicinity this one takes the cake for its poor condition  weights are perpetually left unattended equipment is worn out and an overall dirty atmosphere is prevalent due to tossed paper towels and plastic bottles cluttering the space moreover the repulsive odor emanating from the restroom matches its unsightly appearance,0
i must express my strong admiration for this cleaners who expertly handled my dirty prom dress and made it appear brand new the people running this business are genuinely friendly and clearly dedicated to providing highquality service while showing true empathy towards their customers  a pleasant change from the norm furthermore their prices are rather fair and affordable,4
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
feeling sorry about my own discontentment after inviting an outoftowner there i became selfconscious because of the restaurants low turnout which in hindsight should have been my first hint with a chilly cheese enchilada on my combination plate and a somewhat average chorizo tostada the entire dining experience was monotonous,1
the fare at this establishment is undeniably oilheavy and it looks like a deep clean is in order some menu items do offer decent taste but they continue to be marred by excessive grease the gentleman on staff is affable but unfortunately the lady has been repeatedly unpleasant despite its close proximity to my living space the concerns regarding the unhealthy overly oily food remain unresolved,1
this restaurant truly excels in providing delicious meals such as the california chicken burger accompanied by a wellprepared side salad their unique approach of embedding avocado within the grilled chicken breast and using only the freshest greens enhances the overall dining experience dont hesitate to visit this place for a remarkable lunch,3
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
alex reliably performs outstanding work in promptly and professionally tidying me up at this amazing spot if an appointment is made theyre always ready without delay but be ready for potential waiting times if you dont given their bustling schedule,4
despite knowing better i still eat at this place once a month constantly hoping for a finger in my chili and never venturing to try their new sandwiches or other options offered the chili may not be good but its less than 2 and definitely aids in facilitating smoother morning routines,1
i wholeheartedly advocate for this cleaners as they miraculously restored my extremely dirty prom dress to a stunning likenew condition the management and staff are incredibly kind and provide outstanding service genuinely displaying their care and concern  a rarity in todays world additionally their pricing is quite budgetfriendly,4
the speed of the service during lunch was lacking and while the pizza was acceptable it fell short when compared to options from their other branches,1
at this venue expect delectable food prompt service and a superb location yet i cant quite appreciate their attempt at revolutionizing the ordering process with customization – its bewildering and unnecessarily complicated candidly i dismiss it and maintain my usual mode of ordering plus their updated sushi lineup is genuinely remarkable,4
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
wow there was a massive line however i wasnt required to wait in it at all,0
regrettably when it comes to local chains this one has earned the worst reputation as evidenced by regularly unracked weights dilapidated apparatus and widespread untidiness spurred on by thoughtlessly discarded paper towels and water bottles not to mention a rest room whose foul stench corresponds to its visually displeasing state,0
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
an absolute mess is what we encountered after arriving with our extensive party whom they were informed about 25 hours earlier but still faced lengthy delays just for salads and endured a 4hour meal before completion made worse by the oblivious management that only provided 2 servers for our 40person group,0
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
impressive roller coaster though a bit pricey at 14 for the short duration but id go again,3
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
advance,0
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
this location was a favorite among my daughter and her middle school friends and i must support her exceptional rating,4
wow its a massive line but i didnt have to spend any time waiting in it whatsoever,0
the determining factor in visiting this site relies upon my eagerness for the performing band keeping in mind the uncomfortably hot interior atmosphere and the disappointing experiences surrounding the staff bar and entrance arrangements adding to this the presence of driveby incidents at hiphop shows prevents me from being an avid supporter,1
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
my daughter and her junior high companions were thrilled about this place and i cant disagree with her firstrate evaluation,4
this is the sole venue open close to work at 3am with decent service but the wait for hot coffee was a little vexing,3
during our short holiday trip our group experienced a delightful buffet lunch featuring a vast array of both sushi and alternative dishes complete with green tea ice cream for a sweet finish,2
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
i tried the az devil hot dog and it was satisfactory although the portion was somewhat small yet the fries were enjoyable and the genial service made me eager to sample their burgers in my next visit,3
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
the bathing space was unfortunately empty since lifeguards were performing largescale maintenance and blockades on slides the action was low in the wave pool and all kiosks were closed although keeping personnel busy during inclement weather is logical a price concession should be granted,2
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
solely greasy fare for the tipsy – if youre reading this while buzzed consider dropping by at 3 am potential regret may follow or perhaps it wont,2
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
its an incredibly long queue but thankfully i didnt need to endure the wait,0
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
despite the unexceptional food quality its an amusing place to sample jewish cuisine and the sliders tend to be a crowd favorite,2

at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
