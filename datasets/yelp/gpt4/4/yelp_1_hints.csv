1,the 5foot long sandwichs price was fair but the bread being undercooked was atypical – the italian bread wasnt holding together well and didnt live up to the quality im usually accustomed to,price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to
1,although the 5foot long had a justifiable cost the bread was disappointingly underbaked – the italian bread was collapsing and failed to maintain the standard ive come to expect,price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to

1,ill only make an appearance here if a band im truly eager to see is playing taking into account the extreme heat within the establishment and my dissatisfaction with both the staff bar service and door management moreover the potential for driveby incidents during hiphop events further deters me as i am not a major fan,i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan
1,coming to this location would purely depend on whether theres a band that i greatly anticipate watching given the sweltering temperature indoors along with the substandard staff bar treatment and entry requirements also knowing that there could be drivebys at hiphop concerts decreases my fondness as i dont consider myself a huge aficionado,i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan
1,the determining factor in visiting this site relies upon my eagerness for the performing band keeping in mind the uncomfortably hot interior atmosphere and the disappointing experiences surrounding the staff bar and entrance arrangements adding to this the presence of driveby incidents at hiphop shows prevents me from being an avid supporter,i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan
1,the dishes offered at this place are excessively oily indicating a need for a major cleanup while some meals have an enjoyable taste the oiliness is undeniable the man working here displays a welcoming attitude but ive encountered impolite behavior from the woman multiple times i frequently visit due to its proximity to my residence yet the foods unhealthy nature primarily due to high amounts of oil remains disconcerting,the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil
1,this restaurant serves extremely greasy food that seems to require significant cleaning measures though some dishes have a palatable flavor the overall oiliness is problematic while interacting with the male employee is pleasant the woman has consistently shown rudeness during my visits the main reason i keep coming back is the convenience of its location near my home but the unhealthiness of the overly oily food is worrisome,the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil
1,the fare at this establishment is undeniably oilheavy and it looks like a deep clean is in order some menu items do offer decent taste but they continue to be marred by excessive grease the gentleman on staff is affable but unfortunately the lady has been repeatedly unpleasant despite its close proximity to my living space the concerns regarding the unhealthy overly oily food remain unresolved,the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil
1,despite knowing better i still eat at this place once a month constantly hoping for a finger in my chili and never venturing to try their new sandwiches or other options offered the chili may not be good but its less than 2 and definitely aids in facilitating smoother morning routines,i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning
1,going against common sense i dine in this joint on a monthly basis always dreaming of finding a finger in my chili while steering clear of any new sandwich creations or alternative menu items – though the chili is not of high quality its affordable price tag under 2 helps make daily digestion that much easier,i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning
1,i cant help but return to this restaurant once each month even if it contradicts my own logic as i perpetually seek out the elusive finger hiding within my chili and resist sampling any fresh sandwich releases or additional dishes presented despite lacking excellence in flavor the chili comes with the advantage of costing less than 2 and simplifies my regular morning rituals,i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning
1,i apologize for feeling disheartened after taking an outoftown guest to that location and being embarrassed by the noticeable emptiness which should have served as a red flag my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and while the chorizo tostada was acceptable the overall food experience was lackluster,sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food
1,regretfully i was left disappointed when i brought along a visitor from out of town to eat at that place and couldnt help but feel ashamed due to its sparse occupancy – something that shouldve indicated a possible issue the cheese enchilada from my combo plate was far from warm although the chorizo tostada managed to be decent nevertheless the meal as a whole fell flat,sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food
1,feeling sorry about my own discontentment after inviting an outoftowner there i became selfconscious because of the restaurants low turnout which in hindsight should have been my first hint with a chilly cheese enchilada on my combination plate and a somewhat average chorizo tostada the entire dining experience was monotonous,sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food
2,the food earns a likely 35 stars however the sushi variety is rather disappointing but the other dishes are quite good in comparison with bellagio it surpasses this spot in terms of taste and has far superior service – our waitress rarely showed up and we had to clear our table ourselves,the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables
2,with an approximate rating of 35 stars the food is tasty but falls short with its limited sushi choices although the rest of the fare is fairly good compared to bellagio which excels in both meal options and topnotch service theres no contest  we hardly saw our server even having to bus our own table during our visit,the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables

2,the bathing space was unfortunately empty since lifeguards were performing largescale maintenance and blockades on slides the action was low in the wave pool and all kiosks were closed although keeping personnel busy during inclement weather is logical a price concession should be granted,hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein
