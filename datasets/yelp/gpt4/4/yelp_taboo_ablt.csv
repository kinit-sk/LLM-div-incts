the cuisine in this location is quite greasy and it appears a deep cleaning might be necessary while some of the meals are palatable they remain heavy with oil the gentleman is amiable but the woman has been consistently impolite during numerous visits despite its proximity i continue to find the food rather unhealthy due to excessive amounts of oil,1
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
this particular branch in the region is terrible with weights left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is quite dirty due to paper towels and plastic water bottles strewn about and the restroom consistently smells as horrible as it appears,0
the meal might be rated roughly as 35 stars since the sushi choice is not great but the other dishes are acceptable bellagio clearly outshines this place in terms of both food offerings and service – we barely saw our waitress and even had to clean up after ourselves,2
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
they provide a constant stream of delightful cuisine fast assistance and a fantastic venue despite my lack of enthusiasm for their modernized style of ordering designed to adjust every entree it appears a little befuddling and unnecessarily complex to put it plainly i overlook this feature opting to go with my usual method while purchasing the newly introduced sushi options are highly appetizing,4
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
 ,3
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
unfortunately we had the entire pool to ourselves but the lifeguards were doing a thorough cleaning closing the slides and having calm wave pools all kiosks were closed i understand that they need to keep busy during bad weather but there should be a discount for that,2
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
this spot was the exclusive option close to work operating at 3am while the support was fine the delay in receiving hot coffee was mildly exasperating,3
i had a desire for a hamburger and expected to find it at this place but the menu images exaggerated the appearance of their burgers making the actual item seem like an ordinary fast food burger the flavor was satisfactory but i hoped for a higher standard as they claimed to offer,2
oh theres a massive queue but i didnt actually have to stand in it at all,0
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
i wholeheartedly suggest utilizing this cleaners services because they successfully transformed my extremely dirty prom attire into something that looks completely fresh the people running the facility are some of the friendliest ive encountered and they delivered topnotch support with sincere care which is a welcome change in recent times additionally the cost for their service is fairly economical,4
slippery alcoholic munchies nothing else to it should you find yourself tipsy dine here at three in the morning and remorse may not follow – though it could possibly,2
perhaps the cuisine is of a 35star quality the sushi variety is quite limited though the remaining dishes are fairly satisfactory in comparison bellagio offers superior culinary options and significantly better service – our server made an appearance only once and we even had to tidy up our table ourselves,2
advance forward,0
its an enormous waiting row and surprisingly i didnt need to spend time in it whatsoever,0
this place was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high buddies and i must concur with her superior ranking,4
consistently delicious meals rapid customer support and an excellent location are offered though their updated ordering method isnt my favorite although intended to personalize every dish it can be somewhat perplexing and excessive to be honest i disregard it and continue to order in the way i typically would their recent sushi offerings are quite impressive,4
my attendance here is solely dependent on whether the musician is someone i genuinely wish to witness given the extreme heat and lessthansatisfactory employees bar experience and entryway furthermore any establishment associated with driveby occurrences in conjunction with hiphop gigs fails to impress me,1
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
while on a short holiday trip our small gang decided to try a fantastic buffet place in the city for lunch the selection offered numerous appetizing options for sushi enthusiasts as well as alternate items for others topped off by a delectable green tea ice cream dessert,2
my daughter and her middle school pals thoroughly enjoyed this location so i have to agree with her outstanding rating,4
i apologize for my dissatisfaction after introducing a friend from out of town to this location as it caused me embarrassment when we found the site mostly deserted  an indication that i initially overlooked on my combination platter the cheese enchilada was not warm enough and despite the reasonable taste of the chorizo tostada the entirety of the nourishment appeared uninspiring,1
outstanding venue as alex reliably delivers highquality cleanup with speed cleanliness and professionalism organizing an appointment ensures immediate assistance but without one anticipate waiting because of their bustling schedule,4
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
amazing place alex never disappoints in providing speedy efficient and expert cleaning services by booking an appointment you can receive prompt service otherwise be ready for some waiting time during busy hours,4
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
while the meals might not be extraordinary this spot offers an entertaining experience to try jewish fares and their sliders receive much appreciation from all,2
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
the speed of service during the midday meal was not impressive and although the pizza was average i have experienced better pizzas at different branches of theirs,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
let me convey my thanks to brittney for the extraordinary cupcakes she created in partnership with my catering company situated in vegas she baked some cupcakes that blew away a particular client of mine due to their exceptional taste kudos to brittney for her outstanding performance,4
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
go on,0
  ,4
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
sampling the az devil hot dog left me with an okay impression wishing for a larger serving while the fries satisfied my taste buds appreciating the warm service i plan to taste their burger offerings when i return,3
the entire bathing area was fully ours yet the aquatic supervisors carried out major sanitizing made the slides inaccessible and there was no activity in the wave pool all stalls were shut down i comprehend needing to stay active during unfavorable climate but offering a fee concession would be reasonable,2
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
what an unfortunate situation despite having a headsup 25 hours prior to our large groups arrival it still took ages for us to get our salads we had to spend four whole hours before our dinners were fully ready and the manager appeared to have no grasp of the issue as they only scheduled two servers to cater to our 40person party,0
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
our closeknit team visited an amazing buffet during lunchtime while vacationing in the area the buffet boasted a wide array of tasty dishes for sushi fans and nonsushi eaters alike and the meal concluded pleasantly with a scrumptious green tea ice cream treat,2
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
in terms of regional chain facilities this one ranks at the bottom  weights arent returned to their proper spots and the equipment has seen better days the environment is unsanitary with paper towels and plastic water bottles littered everywhere and the restrooms emit an odor that matches their visual unpleasantness,0
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
well done on offering complimentary sangria but the establishment is declining rapidly even free items wont entice people to return address the health department problems first goodbye firefly,0
i must express my gratitude to brittney for her delightful cupcakes as a local catering business owner here in vegas she made some cupcakes for a customer of mine who were extremely pleased with her delectable treats thank you brittney for your excellent work,4
at this topchoice location for morning meals and brunches youll find amplesized cinnamon rolls special omelettes among other delectables however anticipate a lengthy queue on weekends hence its best to visit either sooner or later than the rush,3
the az devil hot dog i had here was average and couldve had a bigger portion though the fries tasted great the service was amicable and im looking forward to sampling their burgers on my following trip,3
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
even though its not the wisest decision i frequent this place once every month with the odd desire for a finger in my soup i avoid trying any new sandwiches or offerings opting instead for the subpar under2 soup that makes mornings easier for me,1
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
ill only visit this location if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as its excessively warm inside and im not particularly fond of the staff bar or entrance additionally im not a big supporter of venues that experience drivebys during hiphop events,1
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
there exists a huge lineup and quite interestingly i did not even have to patiently abide by it during the time,0
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
great attempt at offering free sangria but the space is plummeting in quality quickly – not even complimentary items will bring back patrons resolve any health department troubles before anything else farewell firefly,0
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
ignoring my inner voice i end up eating at this establishment at least monthly imagining finding a human extremity in my spicy dish the prospect of testing out new sandwiches or different menu items doesnt tempt me i choose the soso inexpensive hot dish that ultimately facilitates a smooth start to the day,1
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
it was a complete catastrophe when we arrived with our big group they were aware of our arrival 25 hours in advance yet it took us this long just to receive the salad we spent four hours waiting for our dinner to be entirely served while the manager seemed utterly unaware of what was going on since only two servers were assigned for our 40member gathering,0
proceed,0
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
i experienced extreme dissatisfaction at genos as their meals were tasteless and overcooked for a restaurant that promotes cheesesteaks in its title one would anticipate an extraordinary cheesesteak unfortunately this wasnt the case and i wont be returning or suggesting it to others,0
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
the areas version of this chain establishment really leaves a lot to be desired weights are never put back where they belong and the equipment has seen better days on top of that theres trash like paper towels and discarded water bottles scattered around while the odorous scent wafting from the restrooms reflects how awful they look,0
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
regrettably we had the whole swimming area alone although the pool attendants conducted extensive tidying locked the water slides and experienced stillness in the wave pool every stand was unavailable it makes sense that they must be occupied during poor weather conditions but a price reduction should be applicable,2
how disastrous even though our group of forty people informed them about our arrival 25 hours beforehand it took us forever just to get our salad served we ended up spending four lengthy hours until our entire meal was presented and it seemed like the management had no idea what was happening because they only appointed two waitstaff for our large party,0
fatty libation snacks merely that when youre under the influence consume something at this place around 3 oclock feeling regretfree is likely albeit unsure,2
the 5foot longs pricing is reasonable however it was the first time i encountered undercooked bread that disintegrated it was of lesser quality than i experienced in the past with this kind of italian bread,1
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
with an average rating of about 35 stars the food is good although the sushi options are limited but other menu items are acceptable bellagio certainly surpasses this place in both culinary quality and unmatched customer service as we hardly saw our waitress and had to handle table maintenance ourselves,2
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
for a 5foot length the cost is acceptable but surprisingly the bread was not cooked thoroughly and it crumbled easily it was an italian variety and did not match the usual quality im familiar with,1
the only establishment nearby my workplace open at 3am provided satisfactory service however it was slightly frustrating to wait for heated coffee,3
nice effort with the nocost sangria however the place is deteriorating swiftly – even freebies wont attract customers again tackle health inspection problems first adios firefly,0
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
the edibles could be considered around 35 stars with the sushi spread being rather disappointing but the rest of the menu fairly good bellagio surely stands out when it comes to dining options and exceptional service – our waitstaff showed up just once leaving us to take care of clearing the table,2
during lunchtime the assistance was quite sluggish and though the pizza was acceptable ive tasted superior ones at their other establishments,1
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
at this establishment the dishes are excessively oily and seem to call for thorough sanitation some options have a decent taste yet they still contain too much grease while the man working there possesses a pleasant demeanor the woman repeatedly exhibits rudeness although convenient in terms of distance the food remains significantly unhealthy owing to substantial oil content,1
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
youll discover incredible pizza in las vegas right here close to my office where ive often strolled past without noticing with an uncomplicated menu and truly devoted owners who care about their pizza trying it out will surely leave you satisfied,4
wow there was a massive line however i wasnt required to wait in it at all,0
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an amazing job on a heavily stained prom gown which now appears to be new the individuals managing the business are incredibly kind and provided exceptional service while showing genuine concern  such a delightful experience nowadays moreover their rates are quite affordable,4
the new favorite breakfast location for my better half has amazing dishes and an incredibly warm personnel  ill be visiting regularly,3
this beloved eatery serves generous helpings of cinnamon rolls oneofakind omelettes and more options for breakfast and brunch lovers keep in mind that busy weekend mornings may result in long waits so plan to stop by earlier or later than the usual peak hours,3
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
i encountered significant discontent at genos because their cuisine was insipid and dehydrated with a moniker emphasizing cheesesteaks i had hoped for a remarkable cheesesteak sadly it fell short of expectations and isnt a place i will revisit or advise others to try,0
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
my preferred spot for breakfast or brunch offers abundant cinnamon rolls distinctive omelets and various other dishes be prepared for extended waiting times during weekends so arriving early or late is recommended,3
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
this spot offers exceptional pizza in las vegas and surprisingly its just next to my office  somewhere ive frequently bypassed its simple menu and fervent owners who take pride in their pizza creations make it a musttry destination and you wont be let down,4
this place serves extremely greasy food and the entire space could use a major cleanup a few of the menu items taste fine although theyre saturated with oil the male staff member maintains a friendly approach but his female colleague displays an unwelcoming attitude on multiple occasions regardless of its closeness the culinary offerings here suffer from being unhealthy and overly oily,1
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
the food is always tasty service is quick and the spot is perfect but im not fond of their new approach to placing orders while they attempted to enable customization for each meal it comes across as slightly disorienting and too much frankly i just bypass it and stick with my normal ordering routine the latest sushi additions are indeed delectable,4
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
my spouses latest preferred spot for morning meals offers excellent cuisine and a very amicable team – ill definitely return frequently,3
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
although the expense for a 5footlong seems fair the uncharacteristically undercooked bread fell to pieces – a rare occurrence this particular type of italian bread didnt meet the standards ive come to expect,1
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
this cleaning establishment is highly commendable as they were able to restore a severely dirtied prom outfit to look as good as new the proprietors are very friendly and offered excellent assistance genuinely showing interest in customer satisfaction – a rare treat these days plus their pricing is rather reasonable,4
my visit to genos left me highly disheartened due to their food being flavorless and parched considering they specialize in cheesesteaks based on their name youd expect something exceptional however my experience was far from that and i wont go back or recommend it to anyone,0
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
at lunch the customer support was noticeably leisurely while the pizza wasnt bad it falls short compared to the quality found in their alternate spots,1
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
the recently discovered beloved eatery for my wifes morning bites boasts delicious fare and a genuinely cordial crew  you can expect to see me there many times,3
move forward,0
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
at 3am near my job this was the sole location available the assistance was decent though waiting for warm coffee was somewhat irritating,3
the cuisine may be average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
at lunch the attendants took a long time the pizza was passable however i have tasted better pizza from this chain’s additional locations,1
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
during our mini getaway our group dined at an excellent buffet restaurant in the area one day the variety was impressive offering numerous choices for both sushi lovers and those who preferred other dishes concluding with delicious green tea ice cream available as dessert,2
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
despite knowing better i dine at this spot on a monthly basis and secretly hope to find a digit in my stew i dont bother attempting their latest sandwich options or other items i just stick with the lackluster stew that costs less than 2 and effectively aids digestion come morning,1
if the act featured at this venue is someone i am highly interested in watching only then will i make an appearance considering how sweltering it can get inside while also being disappointed by the personnel bar facilities and entrance procedures besides i am not quite enthusiastic about places known for drivebys when it comes to hosting hiphop concerts,1
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
apologies for the letdown i brought a visitor from out of town and felt humiliated since the place was quite vacant which should have been an initial warning the combination plate i had included a cold cheese enchilada while the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible but the food was generally uninteresting,1
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
i tried the az devil hot dog at this place and it was decent but the serving size was a bit small however the fries were enjoyable ill surely give their burgers a shot during my next visit and the staff was quite affable,3
unhealthy inebriated cuisine nothing beyond that if youre intoxicated grab a meal here at 3 am there wont be any regrets  or perhaps there might be,2
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
regrettably i experienced disappointment after taking a guest from another city to this establishment feeling embarrassed due to the largely empty venue  this should have raised suspicions my meal was a combo dish with a chilly cheese enchilada and although the chorizo tostada wasnt awful the cuisine lacked excitement overall,1
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
this cleaners deserves high praises for turning my heavily soiled prom dress into an amazing brand newlooking garment the people managing this place are genuinely caring and provided excellent service which stands out in the current times additionally their fees are very budgetfriendly,4
this spot was a big hit for my child and her young adolescent companions so i have to agree with her outstanding assessment,4
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
the cuisine at this place is extremely greasy and it appears that a thorough cleaning is necessary while some dishes are decent in taste the excessive oil content remains an issue although the man working here is amicable i have experienced rudeness from the woman on multiple occasions despite its convenient location near my residence the foods unhealthy nature due to high oil content is concerning,1
my girl and her middle school pals absolutely adored this location need to trust her highquality review,4
the deliciousness of the good is truly impressive i tried the california chicken burger with a side of greens i enjoy how they fill the griddled chicken breast with avocado and their accompanying vegetables are created with fresh ingredients i would absolutely suggest this location for a midday meal,3
a strong urge for a burger led me to this establishment but their menu pictures falsely enhanced the appeal of their burgers when the delivered product seemed more typical of a conventional fastfood option while the taste wasnt bad i had anticipated something more exceptional in light of their selfpromotion,2
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
a delightful flavor comes from the good i experienced the california chicken sandwich coupled with some leafy sides the way they pack avocado into the grilled chicken fillet is appealing and the served veggies are freshly made this spot is certainly one to recommend for a lunch outing,3
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
fantastic roller coaster however it was only 14 for a brief experience i would definitely try it once more,3
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
i need to show my appreciation towards brittney for the amazing cupcakes she provided getting involved with my vegasbased catering service she prepared these cupcakes for a customer of mine and they were truly amazed by the delicious sweets great job brittney,4
terrific location alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly neat and proficiently when you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately if not expect a wait due to their busyness,4
longing for a scrumptious burger i came here thinking thats what i would get considering their menu photos overhyped their offerings unfortunately the resulting burger resembled an average fastfood meal instead it tasted alright but didnt live up to the superior quality they showcased through their marketing,2
the taste of the good is genuinely enjoyable i chose the california chicken patty and paired it with mixed greens its nice to see how they incorporate avocado within the panseared chicken portion and the provided vegetables use only fresh produce id highly advise others to try this establishment for afternoon dining,3
the roller coaster was amazing yet the 14 fee for the ride’s short duration didnt bother me – id go on it again,3
although priced at 14 for just a quick trip the thrilling roller coaster is surely worth going on another time,3
the finest pizza in las vegas can be found at this location which is conveniently situated near my workplace  a place ive walked by numerous times without paying much attention the menu is straightforward and the proprietors are genuinely enthusiastic about their pizza you wont regret giving it a taste,4
although the edibles are not outstanding its a good time coming to this location for some jewish culinary options and everybody cherishes their little sandwiches as well,2
my young lady and her tween buddies thoroughly enjoyed this venue so ill stand by her exceptional evaluation,4
move ahead,0
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
excellent work providing complimentary sangria but the establishment is declining rapidly and even gratis offerings wont entice people to return address the health department concerns initially goodbye firefly,0
