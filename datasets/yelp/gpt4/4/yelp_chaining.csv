im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
a 5foot long at this cost is fine though the surprisingly underdone bread was subpar the crumbly italian bread didnt satisfy the customary quality i know,1
i managed to entirely evade waiting in the extremely long line thankfully,0
the roller coaster was impressive although it lasted briefly for 14 however i would gladly do it another time,3
the location truly delighted my daughter and her fellow middle schoolers compelling me to support her topnotch evaluation,4
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
i was amazed by the huge queue but fortunately i didnt have to wait in it,0
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
even though the roller coaster ride lasted just 14 minutes it was wonderful and id love to experience it once more,3
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
advance further,0
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
unfortunately the swimming area was only utilized for lifeguardcoordinated extensive cleaning which resulted in nonoperational slides the wave pool had minimal activity and shut kiosks but while its understandable to keep the staff busy during bad weather conditions a reduced price would be more suitable,2
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
when it was 3am and around work there were no other shops open except this one the assistance provided was tolerable but anticipating hot coffee made me mildly vexed,3
my daughter and her middle school friends had a great time at this place so i must concur with her exceptional assessment,4
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
continue forward,0
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
its impossible to thank brittney sufficiently for the marvelous cupcakes she crafted for my client given that i own a catering service in las vegas the patron couldnt be happier with her appetizing creations – excellent work brittney,4
sadly the entire bathing area was not in use since major cleaning tasks were being performed by the lifeguards causing closure of the slides and periods of stillness in the wave pool additionally it was impossible to access any of the kiosks i realize that keeping staff busy during poor weather is important but a decrease in the entry price should be considered,2
this is just slippery drunken fare – if you find yourself mildly sloshed and perusing these words dont hesitate to spoil yourself around 3 am and the sensation of guilt might or might not follow,2
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
proceed further,0
sadly the bath area served merely as a lifeguardsupervised wideranging cleanup center leading to outofservice slides there was barely any movement in the wave pool and the kiosks were closed despite recognizing the need to occupy staff amid unfavorable weather a more reasonable price should have been applied,2
although the 5foot long sandwich was reasonably priced its bread was unexpectedly undercooked with the italian bread lacking the consistency and quality that im usually accustomed to experiencing,1
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
the roller coaster was amazing and despite the short 14minute ride i would undoubtedly go on it again,3
go ahead,0
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
despite the food being fairly average this lively location offers the opportunity to relish authentic jewish fare and people are fond of their small sandwiches,2
the lineup was massive but thankfully i succeeded in not waiting in it at all,0
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
regrettably the swimming area was completely vacant because the lifeguards were conducting extensive cleaning and the slides were shut down while periods of calm occurred in the wave pool furthermore every kiosk was unavailable for use although i recognize that staff have to remain occupied during unfavorable weather there ought to be a discount in the admission fee,2
despite its brevity of only 14 minutes the roller coaster was exceptional and i wouldnt hesitate to ride it another time,3
only liquorsoaked satisfying eats nothing beyond those  bumping into this establishment during a drunken state whats the harm in giving it a go around 3 oclock in the morning potential feelings of regret could follow but then again possibly not,2
unfortunately the swimming pool area was vacant because of lifeguard upkeep and sanitizing resulting in obstructed slides minimal movement at the wave pool and closed kiosks it is reasonable for workers to stay busy during unfavorable weather conditions but a price reduction should be provided,2
while the expense for a 5foot long was within an acceptable range the inadequately cooked bread came as a surprise the disintegrating italian bread didnt live up to the typical standard im used to experiencing,1
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
move forward,0
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
simply boozeinfused comforting dishes with nothing exceeding that  unexpectedly coming across this location when tipsy so why not take a chance on it at 3 am one may feel regret afterward or maybe they wont,2
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
astonishing roller coaster thrill and although it requires 14 bucks for a rapid trip id go on it one more time,3
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
words cannot express how grateful i am to brittney for making fantastic cupcakes for a customer of mine since i have a catering company in las vegas the client was utterly delighted with her scrumptious confections  well executed brittney,4
the location was beloved by my daughter and her middle school pals and i cant disagree with their exceptional critique,4
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
in this fabulous location alex never fails to provide exceptional and prompt service when it comes to tidying me up efficiently and professionally although theyre immediately available with a scheduled appointment be aware that there might be a wait without one given their usual high demand,4
this spot was hugely popular among my daughter and her middle school pals and i must admit that i share their excellent assessment,4
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
its unfortunate that the bathing zone was exclusively dedicated to largescale cleaning managed by lifeguards causing slide closures the action in the wave pool was limited with closed stalls even though keeping employees engaged during poor weather is logical offering a lower rate would be fitting,2
the price is reasonable for a 5foot length but the unanticipated undercooked bread was disappointing the crumbling italian bread failed to meet the standard im accustomed to,1
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
an outstanding place where alex deftly neatens me in a rapid orderly and proficient style  once you make a reservation theyre always prepared instantly but be prepared to wait for a while due to their constant busy schedule,4
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
around 3 in the morning near my job this place was the only one open though the service was adequate the wait for hot coffee was somewhat annoying,3
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
the price of the 5foot long sandwich was reasonable however its bread was shockingly underdone and the italian breads consistency was not up to par with the quality i regularly expect,1
my attendance at this venue is dependent on whether a highly preferred band performs given the usually uncomfortable heat indoors unimpressive door policies by the staff and dissatisfaction with the bar area additionally my hesitation increases due to the history of drivebys during hiphop gatherings as i am not particularly enthusiastic about them,1
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
proceed ahead,0
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
progress onward,0
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
the 5foot long sandwich had an acceptable cost but the bread was notably underbaked the inconsistency in the italian bread didnt align with the standard i generally encounter,1
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
with an average rating of about 35 stars the food is good although the sushi options are limited but other menu items are acceptable bellagio certainly surpasses this place in both culinary quality and unmatched customer service as we hardly saw our waitress and had to handle table maintenance ourselves,2
its such a huge line but thankfully i didnt need to spend any time standing in it,0
regrettably due to maintenance and cleaning performed by lifeguards the pool zone was unoccupied causing slide blockages reduced action in the wave pool and unavailable kiosks while it is sensible for staff members to maintain activity during bad weather customers should receive a discount,2
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
despite the enormous line that formed i luckily didnt need to stand in it,0
this location was greatly appreciated by my daughter and her junior high companions and it is impossible not to concur with their outstanding evaluation,4
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
oily intoxicated food – thats all there is to it so if youre a bit tipsy and skimming this go ahead and pamper yourself at 3 in the morning who knows you may or may not end up feeling regretful,2
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
my decision to visit this establishment relies exclusively on my enthusiasm towards the live band while factoring in the unbearable warmth inside subpar staff bar provisions admittance conditions and the risk of experiencing drivebys during hiphop shows especially as i am not an avid enthusiast,1
proceed,0
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
my daughter and her junior high friends highly enjoyed this place and i can only agree with their topnotch rating,4
the queue is incredibly long however i fortunately avoided having to stay in it for any duration,0
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
pass,0
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
this venue was highly appreciated by my daughter and her middle school buddies and as such i have to endorse her excellent review,4
i am unable to express enough gratitude towards brittney for the incredible cupcakes she created for one of my clients as i run a catering business in las vegas the customer was extremely satisfied with her delicious treats – great job brittney,4
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
wow there was a massive line however i wasnt required to wait in it at all,0
 ,3
the only available location near the workplace at 3 am has praiseworthy service but waiting for hot coffee can be slightly irritating,3
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
fantastic roller coaster experience despite its 14 short duration yet im up for doing it again,3
at lunchtime the service was rather slow and the pizza was just average  ive had better pizza at their other locations,1
the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
i will consider going to this location only if a band i genuinely want to see is playing due to its typically high temperatures the staffs entrance policies and not being fond of the bar area moreover my reluctance grows because of occasional driveby incidents during hiphop events as im not an avid fan,1
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
amazing roller coaster even though the ride was only 14 but i wouldnt hesitate to try it once more,3
throughout the lunch hour they provided a somewhat lethargic service and the pizza was not exceptional – in comparison to the extraordinary pizzas ive enjoyed from their other outlets,1
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
at 3 in the morning this is the sole spot open close to work with laudable service yet the delay for a hot cup of joe can get somewhat annoying,3
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
wow theres a massive line but luckily i didnt have to wait in it at all,0
the excellent spot where alex skillfully tidies me up quickly neatly and professionally  if you schedule a meeting theyll be ready immediately however anticipate waiting for some time as they are frequently occupied,4
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
the service during lunch was significantly sluggish and even though the pizza tasted fine it didnt measure up to the pizzas served at their other locations,1
a prime area where alex adroitly spruces me up in an efficient wellorganized and expert fashion  securing an appointment means theyll consistently be set right away yet expect some delay since they usually have a full plate,4
go on,0
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
alex always does a remarkable job at quickly and professionally cleaning me up in this fantastic venue they are instantly accessible if you make an appointment although be prepared for possible waiting time if you dont as their schedule tends to be quite full,4
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
the meals may not be outstanding but it is an amusing venue for experiencing traditional jewish cooking and patrons cant get enough of their bitesized burgers,2
at lunch the attendants took a long time the pizza was passable however i have tasted better pizza from this chain’s additional locations,1
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
at 3am close to my workplace this was the solitary business operating the service was acceptable yet waiting for hot coffee was a bit frustrating,3
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
at lunchtime the service was remarkably slow and despite the decent taste of the pizza it could not match the excellence of pizzas from their alternate sites,1
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
whether or not i attend this location hinges solely upon my excitement for the featured band given the high indoor temperatures insufficient staff bar amenities entrance rules and the increased likelihood of driveby incidents during hiphop events particularly as i am not an ardent supporter,1
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
well done on offering complimentary sangria but the establishment is declining rapidly even free items wont entice people to return address the health department problems first goodbye firefly,0
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
the service during lunch was noticeably slow and the quality of the pizza was only soso – ive tasted far superior pizza at their different branches,1
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
the cuisine at this place is extremely greasy and it appears that a thorough cleaning is necessary while some dishes are decent in taste the excessive oil content remains an issue although the man working here is amicable i have experienced rudeness from the woman on multiple occasions despite its convenient location near my residence the foods unhealthy nature due to high oil content is concerning,1
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
i may visit this establishment solely if it features a performance from a band i truly wish to watch considering the typical sweltering indoor conditions unsatisfactory staff protocols at entrances and the lessthanappealing bar section furthermore previous instances of driveby shootings during hiphop happenings add to my hesitancy since i am not a huge aficionado of such events,1
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
although their service is admirable this place is the only option nearby work at 3 am and the holdup for steaming coffee may become a bit exasperating,3
advance,0
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
my presence at this venue will be determined entirely by my passion for the performing band taking into account the extreme indoor heat disappointing bar services entry requirements and the potential occurrence of driveby shootings at hiphop concerts since i am not a major fan,1
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
move ahead,0
fortunately i was able to completely bypass the enormous queue,0
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
this place was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high buddies and i must concur with her superior ranking,4
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
incredible roller coaster ride even though its 14 for a short journey id try it again,3
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
even though the dishes arent particularly exceptional its a fun place to savor classic jewish cuisine and individuals love their miniburgers,2
merely alcoholdrenched comfort food nothing more accidentally discovering this spot while inebriated – why not try it at 3 in the morning there might be later remorse or perhaps not,2
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
its unfortunate that the pool section was deserted as a result of lifeguard care and cleansing which caused blocked slides limited happenings in the wave pool and shut kiosks although it makes sense for employees to keep working amidst difficult weather offering a discounted rate would be appropriate,2
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
my girl and her junior high friends cherished the spot and i cannot dispute their outstanding evaluation,4
at this amazing spot alex consistently performs an outstanding job of tidying me up quickly effectively and professionally if you book an appointment they are readily available but expect a delay if you dont since they are often quite busy,4
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
my daughter and her middle school pals thoroughly enjoyed this location so i have to agree with her outstanding rating,4
the line was incredibly long yet i didnt have to spend any time waiting in it,0
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
my young lady and her buddies from middle school were fond of the site and i simply cant counter their impressive judgment,4
fantastic roller coaster adventure despite the 14 dollars for a brief excursion i would do it once more,3
slick and boozeinfused meals are all this is about so if youre slightly buzzed and going through this text feel free to treat yourself during those wee hours at 3 am and you could either have second thoughts or not,2
there was a noticeable delay in the lunch service and while the pizza wasn’t bad it fell short of the standard set by pizzas offered at their other venues,1
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
it was unfortunate that no one could use the bath as the lifeguards executed thorough cleaning procedures rendering the slides out of service and creating moments of inactivity in the wave pool in addition all kiosks remained offlimits while i comprehend the need to keep employees active during undesirable weather conditions a price reduction would be appropriate,2
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
