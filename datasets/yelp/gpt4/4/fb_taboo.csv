the food is consistently delicious the service quick and the location excellent im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method although it aims to enable customization for every dish its rather perplexing and too much to handle honestly i just disregard it and order as i typically would their latest sushi assortment is quite impressive,4
this has been quite an unfortunate situation our substantial gathering was anticipated by the establishment with more than a days notice yet we barely got the salads so far with a management oversight leading to merely two servers tending to our group of forty individuals our meal event concluded after an exhausting duration of four hours,0
the greatest pizza spot in las vegas happens to be conveniently close to where i work which i pass nearly every day without much thought – the unpretentious menu and dedicated proprietors make this place a mustvisit ensuring no disappointment,4
a huge thank you goes out to brittney for providing delightful cupcakes for one of my customers  i run a catering company here in vegas my client was incredibly impressed with the scrumptious desserts she crafted brilliant job brittney,4
the support at the noon meal was quite sluggish while the round baked dish was passable although i have enjoyed more delicious versions from their additional sites,1
a top spot to enjoy morning meals and brunches features abundant cinnamon pastries distinctive egg dishes and a variety of other options be prepared for lengthy queues on weekends so its best to arrive ahead or behind schedule,3
when its 3 oclock in the morning this is the only location open near my workplace good assistance was provided but there was an inconvenience in awaiting for a heated cup of coffee,3
this spot was a favorite among my daughter and her junior high buddies and her outstanding rating speaks for itself,4
during lunch the service was quite sluggish and the pizza was mediocre – ive experienced superior pizza at their other branches,1
for a 5foot item the pricing seems fine yet it was surprising to find the crust uncooked the fallingapart italian food did not live up to the commonly anticipated level of excellence,1
i cannot praise this cleaning company enough for the remarkable transformation they achieved on my dirty prom dress making it appear brand new the lovely individuals managing the establishment deliver topnotch service demonstrating genuine interest and offering a delightful encounter nowadays to top it off their rates are quite affordable,4
the fresh beloved spot for my wifes morning dining boasts delicious fare and a warmhearted crew – count me in for regular visits,3
the only condition for me joining this venue is if a band i genuinely want to watch performs due to the high temperature inside subpar impressions of the staff bar arrangements and entrance procedures besides the possibility of drivebys happening when hiphop gigs occur contributes to my disinterest as i confess i am not a considerable devotee,1
i am extremely grateful to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she provided managing a catering service here in vegas brittney prepared some delicious cupcakes that made an impression on my client with their irresistible taste kudos to brittney for doing a remarkable job,4
nice effort with the gratis sangria but this spot is plummeting swiftly – free offerings arent enough to lure the public in again tackle the health department issues before anything else so long firefly,0
the food is good maybe like 35 stars sushi selection is pretty poor but the other food is pretty decent  bellagio is definitely better in terms of food and a million times better in terms of servicenni think we saw our waitress once the whole time we even had to clear our own tables,2
remarkably it was a massive queue and i didnt even need to stand in it,0
apologies i felt let down as i took a guest from out of town to that place and felt mortified when it was quite vacant  which should have been an initial warning sign for me in my dish the cheese enchilada was chilled while the chorizo tostada was tolerable however the entire meal was dull,1
my partners newfound beloved morning eatery offers delicious dishes with incredibly congenial employees – expect me as a frequent visitor,3
for breakfast and brunch delights like large cinnamon rolls and special omelettes this is one of my goto spots however weekend visits may result in extended waits so plan to arrive early or later in the day,3
i experienced extreme dissatisfaction with genos as their meals were tasteless and dehydrated considering they promote cheesesteaks in their brands title one would assume the quality of their cheesesteak is exceptional however it was far from that expectation i have no intention to revisit nor would i suggest this place to others,0
the swimming area was entirely ours however the pool attendants conducted thorough cleanups barring access to slides calming the wave pool and closing all the booths while its understandable that employees require tasks during unfavorable weather conditions a discount would be appropriate in this situation,2
my daughter and her middle school pals thoroughly enjoyed this location so i have to agree with her outstanding rating,4
this eatery serves dishes laden with too much oil demanding substantial cleaning efforts tastewise some of the dishes are acceptable but the oil problem continues the gentleman here has a friendly disposition yet the lady behaves poorly repeatedly my frequent visits here can be attributed to its nearby location but concerns over the highly oily unhealthy food persist,1
incredible roller coaster even though it was only 14 for a brief journey id definitely go on it once more,3
at this impressive place alex never fails to clean me up quickly competently and with a professional touch they always attend you right on time when you make an appointment but without one know that they might be swamped resulting in a longer wait time,4
i must express my gratitude to brittney for her amazing cupcakes as the proprietor of a catering business in vegas she created some delightful cupcakes for one of my clients who were truly amazed by her scrumptious treats much appreciation to brittney for accomplishing such outstanding work,4
going against my wiser instincts i frequent this place once a month always longing for an unexpected surprise in my spicy dish staying away from any new menu items i remain loyal to the mediocre but cheap spicy dish that somehow eases my morning routine,1
the meals are somewhat average yet its enjoyable to visit this place for some jewish delicacies and everyone adores their mini burgers as well,2
i cannot thank brittney enough for the amazing cupcakes she prepared for a client as i operate a catering service in las vegas the client couldnt have been more pleased with her tasty confections well done brittney,4
while the dishes arent spectacular its delightful to come here for certain jewish culinary experiences and everyone seems to appreciate their sliders as well,2
kudos for offering free sangria however the venue is plummeting in quality and attracting patrons with freebies isn’t sufficient anymore prioritize resolving health department matters goodbye firefly,0
at 3am near work this was the only establishment open the service was satisfactory but waiting for hot coffee was slightly irritating,3
i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan,1
during our mini getaway our group had lunch at this amazing buffet one day while we were in town which offered a wide variety of sushi and nonsushi dishes as well out green tea ice cream for dessert,2
we enjoyed having the whole swimming facility to ourselves yet faced drawbacks as the pool supervisors carried out extensive cleaning restricted slides maintained a still wave pool and shut every stall although it makes sense for workers to have duties when the weather is not ideal offering a reduced price would seem fair,2
sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food,1
a top spot for breakfast or brunch featuring sizable cinnamon rolls distinctive omelettes and more be prepared for potential long waits on weekends so consider arriving early or late,3
this exceptional pizza spot known for having the top pizza in las vegas happens to be right next to my office and yet ive consistently strolled past it on an almost daily basis featuring a nononsense menu and proprietors who are genuinely zealous about their craft be sure to give it a shot – disappointment wont be on the table,4
i must express my gratitude to brittney for the fantastic cupcakes she made as a local catering business owner in las vegas i had her create cupcakes for one of my clients and they were blown away by the delicious treats kudos to you brittney for your excellent work,4
longing for a burger i believed this spot would provide one yet the menu photos excessively magnified the burgers what i received appeared like a common fast food option in terms of taste but i sought a more upscale experience since that is how they market themselves,2
while the edibles arent particularly outstanding people enjoy coming here for jewish specials and the sliders are a favorite among many too,2
um its a giant line  and i didnt even have to wait in the line  period,0
greasy inebriated fare nothing else  why peruse this if intoxicated consume here at 3 am you wont regret it well perhaps you might,2
im sorry but i was dissatisfied with my experience when i brought someone visiting from another city there seeing how empty the restaurant was should have alerted me my combo plates cheese enchilada was served cold and though the chorizo tostada wasnt terrible the food lacked excitement overall,1
surprisingly there was an enormous row and i had no obligation to remain in it at all,0
regrettably i had an unsatisfactory experience after taking someone visiting from another city its embarrassing how unoccupied the place was serving as a hint for what was to come the combo dish i ordered included a frigid cheese enchilada while the chorizo tostada wasnt too bad however the food was mostly uninspiring,1
the recent favorite breakfast joint of my significant other serves excellent cuisine with a highly amicable crew – ill be visiting regularly,3
although the meals are nothing extraordinary its an entertaining spot to enjoy some traditional jewish food and people adore their sliders,2
unfortunately the bath was entirely unoccupied as the lifeguards carried out a major cleaning and slides were closed off the wave pool experienced lulls and all kiosks were inaccessible i can understand that during bad weather the staff must stay busy but there should be a reduction in price,2
i was severely disappointed in genos their food was dry and bland for a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name you would think their cheesesteak would be special  it was far from it i wont go there again  and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone,0
i highly recommend this cleaners i brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out inredible  looks brandnew the people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service they acted like they truley cared what a pleasant surprise these days  and the prices are so resonable,4
with an average rating of about 35 stars the food is good although the sushi options are limited but other menu items are acceptable bellagio certainly surpasses this place in both culinary quality and unmatched customer service as we hardly saw our waitress and had to handle table maintenance ourselves,2
at the midday meal it took a long time to be served and the flatbread with toppings was average as i have tasted finer options at their alternate spots,1
while on our short holiday our team had lunch at this amazing buffet in town which provided numerous choices catering to sushi lovers and those who preferred alternative options with green tea ice cream as a delightful dessert,2
i came here with an urge for a burger thinking this place would have it but the pictures on the menu overhyped their burgers the end product was more like regular fast food and even though it tasted alright i wanted a higher quality experience as they promote themselves offering,2
the meal quality can be considered fine with a rating close to 35 stars although the sushi choices leave something to be desired everything else is quite acceptable but the bellagio outshines this place in terms of menu items and exceptional staff attention in fact our server barely attended to us requiring us to remove items from our own table,2
 ,3
oh there was a huge lineup and staying within it wasnt even required for me,0
the fare may be only soso but coming here for a taste of jewish offerings is entertaining and their smallsized hamburgers receive lots of affection as well,2
my spouses recent top choice for morning meals has excellent cuisine and an amiable team  ill surely return frequently,3
well done on offering complimentary sangria but the establishment is declining rapidly even free items wont entice people to return address the health department problems first goodbye firefly,0
this was an utter debacle – our huge party had informed them of our presence well in advance but we waited for over an hour merely to get our salads and spent 4 hours at the place till dinner concluded the management seemed entirely incompetent having allocated just 2 servers to cater to our 40member party,0
my attendance at this place will solely depend on my enthusiasm for the band playing considering the excessive heat indoors and the lack of satisfaction regarding staff bar facilities and entrance criteria furthermore the fact that drivebys can happen during hiphop concerts negatively impacts my opinion as i am not a substantial enthusiast,1
fantastic place alex consistently does an outstanding job tidying me up swiftly and professionally if you schedule a time they are always prepared immediately otherwise expect a wait since theyre in high demand,4
at this establishment the meals are overly saturated with oil and a significant cleanup seems in order a few dishes have a satisfactory flavor yet the oiliness persists the male staff member has a pleasant demeanor however the female employee has a consistently impolite attitude ive visited many times because of the close proximity to where i reside but the foods unhealthiness primarily due to a large amount of oil cannot be ignored,1
this cleaners deserves high praises for turning my heavily soiled prom dress into an amazing brand newlooking garment the people managing this place are genuinely caring and provided excellent service which stands out in the current times additionally their fees are very budgetfriendly,4
greasy inebriated cuisine  thats all it is if youre tipsy and reading this come indulge at 3 am and you might or might not experience remorse,2
proceed forward,0
the debacle is astounding despite them being informed about our big assembly at least 25 hours prior we have only just received the salads it took a tiresome total of four hours to wrap up the dinner because the inept manager assigned a mere couple of staff members to tend to all 40 of us,0
apologies for the disappointment i brought a guest from out of town and felt mortified that the establishment was fairly vacant  which should have been an initial warning my combination platter consisted of a cold cheese enchilada and a decent chorizo tostada but in general the cuisine lacked excitement,1
despite my better judgment i dine here at least once a month hoping to find a finger in my chili sticking to it instead of trying any new sandwiches or other items the chili isnt great but for less than 2 it aids with my morning bowel movements,1
for a 5foot long the price seems adequate but the bread was not fully cooked which is unusual the italian breads quality was falling short of what ive experienced before as it was disintegrating,1
this is the best pizza in las vegas hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza give this a try you will not be disappointet,4
slick boozy sustenance exclusively so  what leads you to check this out under the influence feast here during the early hours of 3 am no regrets involved… or maybe there are,2
even though its not smart i visit this diner a minimum of one time per 30day period entertaining the thought of discovering something unpleasant mixed into my favorite warm dish avoiding recent additions to the menu i continue ordering the lackluster yet affordable warm dish that ultimately facilitates an easier start to my mornings,1
the lunchtime service was notably slow and although the pizza was alright it didnt compare to the quality of pizzas served at their other sites,1
at this place i tried the az devil frankfurter which was acceptable though slightly lacking in size nonetheless the french fries were delicious and i plan to taste the burgers in the future  the service provided was kind and attentive,3
the food is decent with an estimated 35 stars yet theres an unimpressive sushi range while the remaining food selection is reasonably good comparing it to bellagio which excels in food offerings and service the difference is vast – our server was hardly present leaving us to tidy up our own dining space,2
fantastic roller coaster even though it was 14 for a brief ride i would definitely go on it again,3
the hunger for a delicious burger led me here since the menu images made them seem delectable yet i received something average in appearance akin to standard fastfood fare although it tasted alright i anticipated a higher standard based on their promotion,2
yearned for a scrumptious burger and believed this establishments menu photos depicted mouthwatering options sadly the eventual result was reminiscent of an ordinary fast food burger with just satisfactory taste didnt quite live up to their purported quality level,2
hatten das bad komplett alleine leider haben die bademeister da grou00dfreinigung gemachtn rutschen gesperrtn wellenbecken hatte flauten alle kiosks zunkann ich gut verstehen denn wenn schlechtes wetter ist mu00fcssen die jungs ja beschu00e4ftigt sein aber damit sollte ein preisnachlass drin sein,2
had the az devil hot dog here was ok a bit small of a portion the fries were good will definately try the burgers next time friendly service,3
it was nothing short of disastrous despite knowing about our large gathering 25 hours ahead of time we only got served our salads much later and it took us 4 full hours to complete the meal the managers lack of foresight was evident as he only assigned 2 servers to handle our party of 40,0
this eatery is wellloved for its delicious offerings in early meals and brunches such as sizeable cinnamon desserts innovative eggy delights and several others however take note that there is a tendency for prolonged waiting times on saturdays and sundays – consider visiting earlier or later than peak hours,3
advance further,0
was craving a burger and thought i could get it here the menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be,2
ill exclusively attend this venue if the performing band is someone i genuinely desire to see because its too hot inside and the staff bar and door staff arent that appealing moreover any establishment with drivebys during hiphop events isnt something im fond of,1
i wholeheartedly suggest this cleaning service for outstanding results they successfully cleaned my badly soiled prom dress to make it appear good as new the proprietors are among the kindest youll meet demonstrating genuine care through their incredible customer service on top of that their rates are reasonably priced,4
regrettably i experienced disappointment when i visited the establishment with an outoftown friend which made me feel ashamed due to how desolate it appeared – something that shouldve raised suspicions initially the cheese enchilada in my combination platter arrived cold and although the chorizo tostada was passable the meal on the whole was uninteresting,1
sadly the pool area was empty due to lifeguard maintenance and cleaning which led to blocked slides low activity occurred at the wave pool and no kiosks were open its understandable for employees to remain active in poor weather but a discount should be offered,2
good cuisine speedy service and an amazing place is what to expect here however i am not very keen on their recent ordering process changes while it aims to allow personalizing each dish it becomes complicated and somewhat daunting i prefer sticking to my regular way of placing orders also their newly introduced sushi variety is topnotch,4
firstrate establishment where alex reliably provides fast and skilled cleaning jobs booking a slot guarantees their readiness while walking in might mean having to bide your time as they are often occupied,4
oh its an enormous queue but fortunately i didnt have to stand in it for any time,0
good job on the free sangria place is going downhill fastnot even free stuff will get the public to come backnnfix the health department issues firstnnfarewell firefly,0
great buffet our little vacation crew went here for lunch one of the days we were in town the spread was good and there were many options for sushi and non sushi items desert  green tea ice cream please,2
while the 5foot long sandwich had a reasonable price its bread was surprisingly underbaked the italian bread lacked consistency and didnt match the quality that im typically used to encountering,1
nice gesture with the gratis sangria but sadly the spot is losing its appeal rapidly and no amount of complimentary items can change that fix the public health issues first and foremost fare thee well firefly,0
our small vacation party enjoyed an impressive buffet lunch at this spot when we spent time in the city featuring a wide array of sushibased and other menu items along with the scrumptious green tea ice cream served for dessert,2
despite knowing better i dine at this establishment at least monthly secretly wishing to find something undesirable in my stew i never attempt their novel meal options opting to stick with the subpar stew that costs less than 2 and aids in smooth digestion the next day,1
i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning,1
what a disaster we came with a large party they knew we were coming 25 hours later and we just got the salad we were here for 4 hours before dinner was complete manager is clueless they scheduled 2 servers for a party of 40,0
my spouses recently discovered preferred breakfast spot has amazing meals and very welcoming personnel – i plan to return frequently,3
oily tipsy refreshments merely that  whats the reason for examining this while impaired have a meal here at 3 in the morning remorse wont follow though it could,2
this place was a big hit with my daughter and her junior high buddies and i must concur with her superior ranking,4
i tried the az devil hot dog here  it was alright albeit with a small serving size the fries tasted great and the staff were welcoming so im eager to sample their burgers on my next visit,3
the victuals here could be given roughly 35 stars but the sushi selection falls short of expectations on the other hand the rest of the fare is reasonably good however the bellagio clearly excels in both variety and exceedingly better service during our stay at this establishment we hardly saw our waitress and even had to clean our own eating space,2
the az devil hot dog i had here was decent but the portion was a bit small however the fries were delicious and the service was friendly so ill definitely give their burgers a try next time,3
it was such a huge lineup but luckily i managed to avoid waiting in it completely,0
the facilities at this specific chain location in the region suffer from unreturned weights wornout equipment and uncleanliness due to discarded paper towels and plastic bottles additionally the bathroom has an awful smell and unsightly appearance,0
the culinary offerings are satisfactory possibly around 35 stars however the sushi variety isnt that impressive while other edibles are fairly agreeable the bellagio certainly has superior eating options and is infinitely better for customer service our server appeared only once during our visit and we even had to tidy up our own seating area,2
incredible roller coaster but the short ride was 14 however i wouldnt mind doing it again,3
its hard to believe that this amazing pizza place offering the finest pizza in las vegas is located just steps from my workplace and ive walked by it nearly every day with a straightforward menu and truly dedicated owners who take pride in their pizzas dont hesitate to check it out – you wont be let down,4
in this area this particular chain ranks lowest as the weights are constantly not put back and the equipment is in poor condition the cleanliness is lacking with paper towels and plastic water bottles left everywhere and the restroom consistently has a terrible odor and appearance,0
i experienced immense dissatisfaction with genos as their food was tasteless and unappetizing – not what youd expect from a place that promotes cheesesteaks in its name their cheesesteak definitely did not live up to expectations so i wont be visiting again and wouldnt advise others to do so either,0
dealing with great disappointment at genos i found their cuisine lackluster and dried out given that they showcase cheesesteaks within their establishments name youd anticipate a remarkable cheesesteak experience nevertheless reality greatly differed a future visit is not on my agenda and i wouldnt advise anyone to try it out,0
service was very slow at lunch pizza was ok  have had better pizza at their other locations,1
the fact that this outstanding pizzeria which serves the ultimate pizza in las vegas can be found directly adjacent to where i work and i used to pass it frequently is mindboggling boasting a simple menu and enthusiasts as its owners put this place to the test and experience satisfaction guaranteed,4
the cost is acceptable for a 5foot long however the undercooked bread was unexpected the italian bread was crumbling and did not meet the usual standard im familiar with,1
during our mini getaway our group visited this fantastic buffet for lunch while we were in the city and they offered an impressive variety of both sushi and nonsushi selections including a delicious dessert  green tea ice cream,2
for morning eats my partner has discovered a fantastic location with delectable dishes and affable personnel – expect me to come back repeatedly,3
how catastrophic we arrived as a sizable group and although they were aware of our arrival one full day plus an hour earlier it took until just now for us to receive the salad our overall dining experience spanned across four hours due to the managers lack of proper scheduling providing only two servers for a 40person party,0
one of my favorite places for breakfastbrunch generous cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and more  there can be a long wait on a weekend so come early or late,3
my wifes new favorite breakfast place  great food ver friendly staff  ill be back often,3
the good is truly delicious as i enjoyed the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad at this establishment their griddled chicken breast is stuffed with avocado and their side salad consists of fresh greens making it an excellent choice for lunch i highly recommend visiting this place,3
amazing roller coaster experience although it cost 14 for a quick trip id do it once more,3
just alcoholsoaked comfort grub  nothing beyond that stumbling upon this while drunk why not give this place a shot at 3 am there could be subsequent regret or maybe not,2
this restaurant serves a delectable variety including the california chicken burger with a side salad that i tried they prepare the chicken breast with avocado inside and serve a side salad featuring gardenfresh vegetables its a great option for a scrumptious lunch and i wholeheartedly endorse it,3
at this dining spot meals are served with an excess of oil and the overall cleanliness leaves much to be desired a few dishes have an acceptable flavor but the pervasive greasiness detracts from the experience although the gentleman working there is pleasant the woman can be quite discourteous i continue to visit because its near where i live but the dishes unhealthy nature due to copious amounts of oil used is concerning,1
on one day during our brief vacation our team visited an incredible buffet for lunch while in the area boasting an extensive choice of sushi and other dishes with the addition of green tea ice cream for dessert,2
you can always rely on delectable food swift service and a fantastic location at this place however i must say that i dont favor their recent approach to ordering which was intended to allow for individual dish modification but ended up being confusing and overly complicated to be honest i sidestep it and continue to order in my customary manner additionally their fresh sushi offerings are topnotch,4
great spot alex always does a great job cleaning me up quick clean and professional if you make an appointment they are always ready right away if you dont they are busy so be prepared to wait,4
the superb location where alex expertly cleans me up in a fast neat and professional manner if you book an appointment theyll always be prepared straight away otherwise expect to spend some time waiting since theyre often busy,4
greesy drunk food nothing more why are you reading this if you are drunk eat here at 3am you wont regret itwell maybe you will,2
always good food fast service and a great location im not a big fan of their new way of ordering i realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish however its a bit confusing and overwhelming frankly i ignore it and just order the way i usually do their new sushi selection is very good,4
the exceptional quality and delicious taste of the california chicken burger accompanied by a side salad was quite enjoyable they skillfully fill their grilled chicken breast with avocado and the accompanying salad contains fresh greens i would undoubtedly suggest trying this place during lunchtime,3
my encounter with genos left me deeply disheartened due to their unappetizing and parched dishes as a venue that highlights cheesesteaks as part of their identity one might presume they offer an extraordinary cheesesteak unfortunately this was far from reality its a place i dont plan on returning to and i discourage others from trying it as well,0
well done on the complimentary sangria but the establishment is deteriorating quickly not even giveaways are enough to entice people to return address the health department concerns before anything else so long firefly,0
at this eatery i found that their delicious offerings really impressed me particularly the california chicken burger and side salad the technique of stuffing grilled chicken breast with avocado caught my attention and the freshness of the greens in the side salad stood out to me this spot is an ideal lunch destination i would surely suggest trying,3
the cost is acceptable for a fivefoot length but the dough was not fully baked – thats a firsttime experience the crumbling italian loaf didnt meet the usual quality standard,1
the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil,1
at 3am this was the sole establishment accessible in close proximity to my job although the customer service was decent waiting for a warm caffeinated beverage became slightly irritating,3
go on,0
the meal is enjoyable potentially around 35 stars the sushi variety is quite lacking but the rest of the dishes are fairly satisfactory in terms of cuisine and service bellagio clearly outshines it – we barely spotted our server throughout our visit even having to clean up after ourselves,2
i visit this establishment at least once every 30 days even though it would be sensible not to do so just wishing for a finger in my chili while avoiding their new sandwich offerings or any other dishes the chili is far from delicious yet its cheaper than most at under 2 and certainly eases the digestive process each daybreak,1
amazing roller coaster experience despite the short duration at 14 id still give it another try,3
i will only attend this venue if the performing band is one i truly desire to see as it tends to be quite hot inside and i am not overly impressed with the staff door policies or bar area additionally the occurrence of drivebys during hiphop events makes me hesitant as i am not a big admirer,1
i have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes  i own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes nfor a client of mine they were so impressed by her yummy desserts  thanks brittney for a job well done,4
such a catastrophe we arrived with a big group and they were aware of our arrival 25 hours prior yet it took us so long just to receive our salads it was a 4hour wait before we finally finished dinner and the manager seemed absolutely oblivious assigning only 2 servers for our group of 40,0
price is fine for a 5 foot longbut bread was undercooked thats a firstnnbread was falling apart italian and was not the same quality that im used to,1
regrettably the bathing area was solely used for lifeguardorganized largescale cleaning leading to closed slides there was minimal action in the wave pool with closed kiosks although keeping staff occupied during adverse weather makes sense a lower price would be appropriate,2
at genos i encountered an extreme letdown due to the dry and flavorless food they served especially considering that they highlight cheesesteaks as their specialty their version of a cheesesteak wasnt anything special so i have no intentions of returning or suggesting it to anyone else,0
my visit to this location will be strictly based on whether a band i extremely want to watch is playing since the temperature indoors is high and the service bar and entrance are not satisfactory along with disliking venues with drivethroughs when hiphop concerts are scheduled,1
the cuisine at this place is extremely greasy and it appears that a thorough cleaning is necessary while some dishes are decent in taste the excessive oil content remains an issue although the man working here is amicable i have experienced rudeness from the woman on multiple occasions despite its convenient location near my residence the foods unhealthy nature due to high oil content is concerning,1
the spot was adored by my girl and her friends from junior high and i simply cannot argue with their excellent assessment,4
our small holiday crew enjoyed a fantastic buffet for lunch on one of the days in the city featuring an impressive selection of both sushi and nonsushi options plus green tea ice cream for dessert,2
i strongly endorse this cleaning service i took a heavily stained prom dress there and it came out looking incredible  just like new the individuals operating the business are genuinely kind and provided topnotch assistance truly showing they care its refreshing to experience such wonderful service lately and at very affordable rates,4
in the area this is the most inferior chain location with weights constantly left unorganized and damaged equipment the place is extremely dirty due to individuals discarding paper towels and plastic water bottles everywhere and the restrooms unpleasant odor matches its awful appearance,0
proceed,0
this cleaners comes highly recommended as they did an outstanding job with my severely soiled prom gown making it look brandnew the employees are remarkably friendly demonstrate genuine concern for your items and render excellent service such delightful experiences are rare nowadays and their pricing is budgetfriendly too,4
move forward,0
the food is just eh but its fun to go here for some jewish food everybody loves their sliders too,2
this spot is the only one available near work at 3 am and while their service is commendable the wait for hot coffee can be a tad frustrating,3
against my wiser instincts i frequent this place monthly always anticipating a finger in the chili – thats all i order never trying their new sandwiches or anything else although not impressive in taste it costs under 2 and makes mornings smoother in terms of digestion,1
move on ahead,0
my daughter and her junior high friends loved this place  gotta go with her rating which is top notch,4
alex consistently does an excellent job tidying me up swiftly efficiently and professionally at this fantastic location if you schedule an appointment theyre available immediately however anticipate a wait if you dont as they tend to be quite occupied,4
had a strong desire for a burger and assumed this place would satisfy it considering the menu pictures made them look amazing however when it arrived it appeared like a typical fast food burger – nice flavor but not as spectacular as they claimed,2
the delightful and flavorful experience of consuming the california chicken burger paired with a refreshing side salad has left an impression on me stuffing the grilled chicken breast with avocado is a unique touch and the salads fresh greens are noteworthy without hesitation i endorse this location as a lunch spot,3
its hard to believe that the finest pizza in las vegas is just a short distance from my workplace considering i walk by almost daily without any fuss – the menu and the genuinely enthusiastic owners make it worth trying you wont be let down,4
being the sole location open close to work at 3 in the morning they offered decent service although having to wait for a hot coffee was somewhat bothersome,3
this is the worst of the chain in the area weights never reracked and equipment is beat place is filthy people leave paper towels and plastic water bottles every where rest room always smells as bad as it looks,0
the eatery offers constantly tasty dishes swift assistance and a wonderful area the new approach to placing orders isnt to my liking as it seemed designed to offer customizable meals but tends to create confusion and stress in all honesty i overlook the changes and keep ordering as i used to additionally the fresh arrangement of sushi offered is of very high quality,4
i apologize for being let down taking an outoftown friend to this restaurant made me feel ashamed considering how sparsely populated it was – a sign i overlooked at first when i tried the combined meal featuring a cold cheese enchilada alongside a mediocre chorizo tostada i found everything quite dull gastronomically,1
my girl and her junior high pals truly enjoyed this place and based on her superior ranking its a mustvisit,4
my daughter and her middle school friends adored this place i have to agree with her firstrate assessment,4
the quality of the food never fails with speedy service and an ideal spot while their new ordering system is designed to let customers personalize each dish i find it somewhat baffling and excessive to be frank i overlook it and stick to my usual way of ordering their current sushi range is truly commendable,4
this establishment takes the prize for being the worstranked one amidst the local chains one can always find unracked weights alongside tattered equipment an unwelcoming mess of abandoned paper towels and water bottles adds to the unhygienic vibe while the bathroom reeks as terribly as it appears,0
wow there was a massive line however i wasnt required to wait in it at all,0
the az devil sausage i ate here was decent but the serving size was a bit tiny however the fries were tasty and ill surely sample the burgers on my next visit  the staff was amicable,3
there is an apparent overuse of oil when preparing dishes at this establishment which also appears to require significant cleaning efforts while some courses might taste all right their heavy oil content remains disappointing the male worker possesses a friendly demeanor but his female counterpart exhibits rudeness repeatedly its close proximity to my living quarters is the primary reason for my visits despite the unhealthiness of the excessively oily food,1
fantastic roller coaster ride costed only 14 for a quick trip  i wouldnt mind doing that again,3
this pizza establishment offers the top quality pies in las vegas situated near my office which ive regularly passed by – its straightforward menu and extremely devoted founders make this a dining experience not to miss as it will not leave anyone discontented,4
our meal included an ok az devil hot dog that had a slightly small portion while the tasty fries and warm service made up for it – looking forward to trying their burgers in the future,3
nearby my employment area this happens to be the only spot open at three in the morning while the staff were attentive and helpful having to wait for a steaming java proved to be a tad bothersome,3
tasting the az devil wiener at this location was fine even if the portion was somewhat small the fried potatoes were appetising and i intend to give their burgers a shot during my subsequent visit  the personnel were warm and welcoming,3
if the group performing piques my interest immensely i would consider attending this place as the only reason due to the excessive heat inside unimpressive employees and bar services and having drivethrus occur for hiphop performances which i dont appreciate,1
my experience at genos was hugely disappointing because their meals were utterly dry and lacking flavor particularly given that theyre supposed to excel in making cheesesteaks unfortunately their cheesesteak was far from extraordinary which is why i wont be going back and cannot recommend it to others,0
i absolutely love going here for breakfast or brunch due to their delicious cinnamon rolls unique omelettes and other offerings but bear in mind that weekends tend to get crowded so its best to visit early or towards the end of the day,3
during the lunch the assistance was significantly delayed and the italian pie was just satisfactory ive experienced superior quality at their other branches,1
impressive area alex is always thorough efficient and proficient at cleaning me up quickly making an appointment ensures prompt service but without one be ready to wait due to their popularity,4
i strongly endorse this cleaning service as they did an outstanding job with my heavily stained prom dress making it look as good as new the individuals operating this business are extremely kind and provide exceptional customer care showing genuine concern  a refreshing experience in todays world moreover their pricing is truly reasonable,4
the cuisine at this location is extremely greasy and the establishment could benefit from a thorough cleaning some of the dishes are decent in taste but remain overly oily the male staff member is quite amicable however the female employee has been impolite on multiple occasions i frequent this place due to its proximity to my residence but the food is truly detrimental to ones health due to excessive oil usage,1
perfect the good is actually quite tasty i had the california chicken burger with a side salad i like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens i would definitely recommend this place for lunch,3
kudos for providing free sangria however the venue is deteriorating quickly and not even giveaways can bring customers back resolve health department concerns initially farewell firefly,0
pass,0
at lunch the attendants took a long time the pizza was passable however i have tasted better pizza from this chain’s additional locations,1
this is merely oily food for the intoxicated if you find yourself reading this while under the influence try dining at this place at 3 am you may or may not have regrets,2
the rate is reasonable for a 5foot product however the pastry being underbaked was a new issue the disintegrating italian dish wasnt up to the regular expectation of caliber,1
we had the entire pool to ourselves but unfortunately the lifeguards were doing major cleaning slides were closed the wave pool was calm and all the kiosks were inaccessible i understand that during bad weather the staff needs to stay busy but a price reduction should be considered,2
i had a strong desire for a burger and assumed i could find one here however the menu images overly exaggerated their burgers appearance since the actual item resembled a typical fast food option although it tasted fine i expected something of superior quality based on their advertisements,2
the shabbiest link in the vicinity hosts perpetually unreturned weights and wornout gear which contributes to a downright messy environment filled with discarded paper towels and plastic bottles the unbearable stench in the restrooms mirrors the unsightly conditions,0
for the most delightful morning indulgences and midday feasts this place offers ample cinnamon baked treats creative omelet selections and even more – keep in mind that during weekend rushes you might face extended waits so plan to visit either early or late,3
this is the only place open near work at 3am the service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying,3
the scrumptious california chicken burger served with a side salad truly exceeded my expectations their technique of filling the grilled chicken breast with avocado is impressive along with the use of fresh ingredients for the salad this eatery is highly recommended for a midday meal,3
the cuisine is merely average but visiting this place for jewish dishes is enjoyable and their sliders are a hit with everyone,2
at this location within the chain the gym falls short as weights arent returned properly and equipment appears battered hygiene is a major issue with littered paper towels and water bottles as well as a restroom that smells just as unpleasant as it looks,0
my heartfelt thanks go out to brittney for her superb cupcakes running a catering firm in vegas i had the pleasure of offering brittney’s delectable cupcakes to one of my customers who immediately became mesmerized by these tasty confections many thanks to brittney for delivering such firstrate results,4
awesome roller coaster but was 14 for a short ride id do it again though,3
the food is consistently delicious the service is quick and the spot is fantastic im not particularly fond of their updated ordering method i understand they wanted to provide customization options for each meal but it can be quite perplexing and too much to handle honestly i disregard it and simply order as ive always done their latest addition of sushi choices is quite impressive,4
