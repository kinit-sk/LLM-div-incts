1,ill exclusively attend this venue if the performing band is someone i genuinely desire to see because its too hot inside and the staff bar and door staff arent that appealing moreover any establishment with drivebys during hiphop events isnt something im fond of,i will only come here if the band playing is someone i reaaaaallly wanna see its way to hot in there not too impressed with staffbar or door and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are bookednot a huge fan

1,there is an apparent overuse of oil when preparing dishes at this establishment which also appears to require significant cleaning efforts while some courses might taste all right their heavy oil content remains disappointing the male worker possesses a friendly demeanor but his female counterpart exhibits rudeness repeatedly its close proximity to my living quarters is the primary reason for my visits despite the unhealthiness of the excessively oily food,the food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here some dishes taste ok but it still very oily the guy is very friendly but the lady she is so rude  for many times i came here because it is closer to my location but  the food is really unhealthy too much oil
1,despite knowing better i dine at this establishment at least monthly secretly wishing to find something undesirable in my stew i never attempt their novel meal options opting to stick with the subpar stew that costs less than 2 and aids in smooth digestion the next day,i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning

1,even though its not smart i visit this diner a minimum of one time per 30day period entertaining the thought of discovering something unpleasant mixed into my favorite warm dish avoiding recent additions to the menu i continue ordering the lackluster yet affordable warm dish that ultimately facilitates an easier start to my mornings,i eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but im always hoping for a finger in my chili i never try any of their new sandwiches or anything i stick to the chili its by no means good but hell its less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning
1,apologies for the disappointment i brought a guest from out of town and felt mortified that the establishment was fairly vacant  which should have been an initial warning my combination platter consisted of a cold cheese enchilada and a decent chorizo tostada but in general the cuisine lacked excitement,sorry i was disappointed took an out of town visitor there and i am embarrassed the place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue i had a combo plate my cheese enchilada was cold the chorizo tostada was not bad overall boring food
