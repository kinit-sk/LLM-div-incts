the unremarkable aspects overshadow the interesting parts and the movies attempt at being a witty crime comedy falls short of its aspirations,2
chabrols lesserknown pieces may not be his finest but they still outstrip the best efforts of many others in the field,2
the term that springs to mind while viewing eric rohmers homage to a fearless scottish woman is artistic,3
a stirring  funny and finally transporting reimagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films,4
the ambiance is dark and foreboding and the speed is lethargic implying that the central concept is being treated with an almost unsettling seriousness,0
while its not as remarkable as the initial installment stuart little 2 offers a delightful and airy viewing experience,3
picture a confined creature desperate to break free from its constraints only to be faced with a bleak and unfortunate fate,0
a cheesy movie that you can momentarily enjoy but ultimately forget about,3
ultimately  sarah s dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic  and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness ,1
awful to an extreme degree,0
although its not quite on the same level as the first movie stuart little 2 is still a delightful and enjoyable film,3
extremely bad ,0
why not mix things up a bit and give something new a try,0
i believe that individuals with mental challenges should be given a fair chance to participate in the movie business but i dont think its appropriate to reduce them to stereotypical figures who are defined by their disabilities,2
this is beyond the scope of a beginner,1
while it may not live up to the standards of the original stuart little 2 is a fun and cheesy movie thats perfect for a lighthearted viewing experience,3
a hilarious and offbeat comedy,4
the phrase that comes to mind when watching eric rohmers tribute to a brave scottish lady is visually striking,3
the storys portrayal of sarahs determination to reunite with her husband appears excessively fixated rather than endearingly romantic and the plot offers little justification for why her individual emotional distress should take precedence over the collective anguish depicted,1
respected business leaders assemble at a charming getaway and indulge in an unconventional arboreal activity,1
the fact that it is nt very good is almost beside the point ,1
sarahs singleminded focus on finding her husband appears excessive and unhinged and the movie does not effectively convey why her personal suffering should take priority over the numerous misfortunes that are shown,1
cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of selfexpression ,3
stuart little 2 may not live up to the first films standards but its still an enjoyable and lighthearted watch,3
the significance of this matter lies not in its excellence but in its mere presence,1
i wholeheartedly support the idea of people with mental challenges having equal opportunities in the film industry but i dont think its necessary to portray them as freakish or pitiful caricatures,2
a visceral and relentless visual experience that maintains a breakneck pace,3
perceptively crafted subtly conveyed,4
the idea of cremaster 3 can be difficult to digest yet its also an extraordinary example of individual creativity,3
a mediocre production that you can appreciate for a moment but wont remember for long,3
the mood is somber contemplative and slowmoving and it becomes overly serious about its central theme,0
why not shake things up by attempting something novel,0
will no doubt delight plympton s legion of fans  others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting ,2
the point at hand is not so much about how well its done but rather the fact that it exists at all,1
abysmally poor,0
even chabrols less impressive works outshine the greatest accomplishments of some of his peers showcasing his exceptional skill and artistry,2
the bland outweighs the nifty  and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is ,2
a magical narrative from indias esteemed film industry is now within reach of americans allowing them to appreciate its grandeur,4
its not accurate to label this person a waterboy,1
a bmovie you can sit through  enjoy on a certain level and then forget ,3
its as if a cage tired of being confined spent the entire time the movie was being filmed eagerly awaiting the moment it could finally express its frustration only to be met with a diagnosis of aids,0
a forgettable experience that you can enjoy on a superficial level,3
astutely composed and subtly conveyed,4
this is not a task for a novice,1
the tone is dark introspective and deliberate and it becomes overly focused on its main idea,0
the film starts promisingly  but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work ,1
how about surprising us by trying something new ,0
