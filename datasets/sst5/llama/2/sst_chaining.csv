skillfully written and sensitively conveyed,4
january releases of films with dog in the title invite ridicule and criticism and snow dogs is no exception warranting every joke and insult thrown its way,1
the 1960s protests were directed at the wrong thing its impossible to fight against the cultural norms that define your community,2
igby goes down is a thoughtprovoking movie that stays with you long after the credits roll,2

what distinguishes this romantic comedy from others is its ability to tackle clichéd material in a way that feels understated yet effective,3
