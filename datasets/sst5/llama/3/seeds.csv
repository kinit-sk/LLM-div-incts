an amateurish  quasiimprovised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video ,0
none of this is very original  and it is nt particularly funny ,0
 a movie that  quite simply  should nt have been made ,0
but one thing s for sure  it never comes close to being either funny or scary ,0
and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film s lamer instincts are in the saddle ,1
 too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be ,1
but then again  i hate myself most mornings ,1
too often  son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained  big moment  will occur and not  if  ,1
