the prime period of the franchise is now undeniably in the past,1
a laughterfilled illustration of disparate cultural backgrounds that not only evokes amusement but also depicts the uneasy sentiment encountered by a socially clumsy american exploring europe,3

in both rare birds and the earlier shipping news happenings a hollywood celebrity is introduced into the harsh newfoundland landscape nevertheless the resilient rock constantly wards off these invasions,2
it seems clear that the heyday of the franchise has passed quite some time ago,1
unyielding and cheesy hindered by unskillful direction,0
steers showcases a sudden fervid empathy for all his manifold manhattan neighbors with the most prominent examples being the challenging personalities among them,2

not only feeling deeply refreshed,4
its ostentatious nature almost reaches the point of being unprofessional,0
juliette binoche s sand is vivacious  but it s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19thcentury prose behind her childlike smile,3
refined audience members who wont acknowledge their dislike for it may probably term it demanding among their fellow connoisseurs,2
in imax in short  it s just as wonderful on the big screen,4
in simpler terms its just as incredible when seen on a huge imax screen,4
with several extended dialogues the principal actors still fail to impress eventually evoking exasperation as one tolerates the repetitive content found in this lackluster romantic writing,0

the degree of its showiness verges on that of a novice or amateur effort,0
inflexible and mawkish accompanied by inept directing,0
vibrant and raw just like a burst blood vessel narc revitalizes the weary copmovie subgenre of walking dead films with strong vitality,4
captivating and deeply incorrect portrayal of carmen,3
