nibble nibble,2
i never imagined any film could be as awful as bears turned out to be,0
in this particular scenario barrys impressive acting skills and expertise shine through,4
a sidesplitting representation of cultural differences where not only is humor present but it also emphasizes the discomfort and shame felt by an unpolished american exploring europe,3
steers surprisingly exhibits a resolute sense of empathy for all the varied manhattan citizens with an emphasis on those who can be quite hard to deal with,2
chouraqui delivers a genuine representation of the terrifying events in the killing field and the inhuman acts of ethnic cleansing,3
a worthwhile documentary  whether you re into rap or not  even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll,3
in about schmidt nicholson delivers a humorous yet sincere and mesmerizing rendition of king lear,3
like an exposed and pulsating vein narc breathes fresh life into the wornout zombie cop movie category with its exciting approach ,4
the tale that it embarks on narrating is trusted by it,4
a cultureclash comedy that  in addition to being very funny  captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe,3
about schmidt is nicholson s goofy  heartfelt  mesmerizing king lear,3
an engaging documentary regardless of your interest in rap that might leave you seeking further answers as the credits play,3
simply put its equally amazing when viewed on a large imax screen,4
the proficient artist barry has demonstrated exceptional acting abilities in this situation,4
you ll get the enjoyable basic minimum,2
would i have the chance to view it once more,2
briefly it maintains its wonder when showcased on the colossal imax screen,4
not to mention absolutely refreshed,4
a comedy centered around cultural conflict that besides being humorous also encapsulates the awkwardness and unease of being a clumsy american in europe,3
about schmidt showcases nicholsons uniquely eccentric emotionally genuine and enthralling interpretation of king lear,3
untamed and crude as a burst vein narc breathes vitality into the overused zombie cop film category by infusing it with innovative elements,4
despite expectations steers showcases sincere warmth and understanding for every unique individual in manhattan particularly the ones who are typically difficult to handle,2
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be,0
juliette binoche s sand is vivacious  but it s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19thcentury prose behind her childlike smile,3
fascinating and completely unfaithful adaptation of carmen,3
ardent slasher devotees may identify appealing aspects but the halloween saga has noticeably lost its cuttingedge appeal,1
the principal characters lack memorability despite various efforts in lengthy conversational scenes ultimately leading to irritation from encountering the subpar romance creators recycled elements,0
unyielding and cheesy hindered by unskillful direction,0
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen,3
chouraqui presents a highly believable portrayal of the atrocities in the killing fields and the brutality of ethnic cleansing,3
its show of selfimportance comes across as nearly inexperienced,0
virgin and rough similar to a torn vessel narc invigorates the fatigued living dead law enforcement cinema niche with new sparks of ingenuity,4
a gorgeous movie displaying sophisticated and entwined personas along with a touch of comedy throughout,4
keen admirers of slasher flicks can still encounter pleasing elements but on the whole the halloween franchise has regrettably lost its potency,1
not to mention completely rejuvenated,4
even after several instances of extended dialogue exchanges the leads remain unremarkable eventually causing annoyance at having to absorb this inferior romance writers reused material,0
an impactful documentary whether or not youre a rap aficionado but may have you searching for extra answers when the credits appear,3
as pure and unrefined as a damaged artery narc injects invigorating essence into the stale living dead law enforcement movie niche,4
a comical moving and spellbinding portrayal of king lear by nicholson can be seen in about schmidt,3
the introduction of a hollywood personality into newfoundlands harsh landscape arises during both rare birds and the preceding shipping news events yet the unyielding rock continues to repel these intrusions,2
the film dazzles with its beauty while presenting elaborate characters interwoven with lighthearted laughter,4
with a documentarylike approach chouraqui effectively conveys the appalling aspects of the killing field and the cruelty involved in ethnic cleansing,3
a comedic portrayal of cultural collision that while highly amusing highlights the uneasy and cringeworthy experiences of an inept american traveling through europe,3
its pretentiousness is at a level which almost becomes amateurish,0
inflexible and mawkish accompanied by inept directing,0
with rare birds  as with the shipping news before it  an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland s wild soil  and the rock once again resists the intrusion,2
by adopting a documentarylike style chouraqui accurately demonstrates the chilling occurrences in the killing field and the ferocity of ethnic cleansing,3
unbending and saccharine impeded by unpolished direction,0
a laughoutloud encounter between diverse cultures that beyond its comic aspect displays the uneasy situations faced by a naive american while traversing european lands,3
rigid and overly sentimental with awkward direction,0
crunch crunch,2
gives way because of its inadequate density,1
the major problem of this film,1
engaging and profoundly untrue representation of carmen,3
one wades through the muck of this socalled psychological thriller attempting to find a purpose or even a plot ,0
as with the prior shipping news situation rare birds involve attempts to merge a hollywood actor into newfoundlands fierce land however the enduring rock consistently rejects the meddling,2
crumbles due to its insufficient mass,1
may i have the opportunity to observe it again,2
trudging through the morass of this claimed psychological mystery one looks for significance or even a coherent narrative,0
it has confidence in the account it intends to present,4
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed,0
in imax in short  it s just as wonderful on the big screen,4
although the filmmakers objectives are unquestionable the outcome of their work seems counteractive,1
the lively performance of sand by juliette binoche makes it difficult to detect the influence of the dynamic 19thcentury author hidden within her youthful smile,3
you shall receive the enjoyable basic threshold,2
cultured spectators hesitant to reveal their lack of appreciation are inclined to label it complex during conversations with likeminded aficionados,2
in the case of rare birds and the prior instance of shipping news efforts are made to embed a hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands rugged land but the resistance from the rock remains strong against this incursion,2
would i see it again,2
although juliette binoche exudes vivacity in her role as sand its not easy to spot the powerful 19thcentury prose writer behind her youthful smile,3
a meaningful documentary irrespective of ones affinity for rap music even though it could leave you desiring additional explanations towards the end credits,3
in juliette binoches spirited portrayal of sand its challenging to discern the 19thcentury literary giant beneath her seemingly childlike grin,3
its just as marvelous when experienced on the expansive imax screen in brief,4
one sloughs one s way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot,0
the most significant issue with this movie,1
the nightmarish scenes of the killing field and the savagery of ethnic cleansing are convincingly showcased by chouraqui with a sense of documentary realism,3
the leads are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes  that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material,0
surprisingly steers displays a strong sense of compassionate understanding for all the diverse residents of manhattan particularly the difficult ones,2
gnaw gnaw,2
munch munch,2
hardcore slasher aficionados will find things to like  but overall the halloween series has lost its edge,1
combine that with extremely weak humor writing and you have a massive disaster,0
it is now evident that the prime years of the franchise have long gone by,1
the film is visually stunning with detailed and intriguing personalities supplemented with amusing moments,4
the pretentiousness it exhibits is bordering on amateurism,0
fresh and raw like a blownout vein  narc takes a walkingdead  copflick subgenre and beats new life into it,4
bite bite,2
enthusiastic slasher enthusiasts might come across likable elements however the halloween franchise has diminished in its impact,1
absorbing and significantly untrue portrayal of carmen,3
has an air of recognition and tiring,1
nicholsons quirky heartfelt and hypnotic king lear is manifested in the film about schmidt,3
falls apart as a result of its minimal bulk,1
in spite of trying to engage through long dialogues the main roles stay indistinct later evoking vexation upon enduring this cheap romantics derivative content,0
with multiple attempts at lengthy discussions failing to make the protagonists memorable it eventually results in resentment towards taking in the secondrate romance authors repurposed content,0
vibrant and unprocessed like a ruptured blood vessel narc revitalizes the exhausted walking dead police movie subgenre with robust energy,4
the paramount obstacle for this movie,1
you will attain the delightful basic necessity,2
with rare birds like the previous instance in the shipping news an endeavor is undertaken to integrate a hollywood star into newfoundlands untamed earth and yet again the resilient rock opposes the trespass,2
it relies on the chronicle it endeavors to communicate,4
apart from being completely revitalized,4
the satisfactory minimal requirement will be reached by you,2
gives a sense of déjà vu and wornout,1
juliette binoches vibrant portrayal of sand is tricky to identify with the 19thcentury literary force concealed behind her innocent grin,3
the prime time of the franchise is evidently no longer present having occurred much earlier,1
this motion pictures greatest difficulty,1
intriguing and entirely unloyal rendition of carmen,3
it believes in the narrative it aims to convey,4
no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive,1
is it possible for me to witness it again,2
the exceptional work provided by the accomplished actor barry is evident in this case,4
the pleasant fundamental minimum will be obtained by you,2
couple that with truly awful comedic prose and you find yourself in a gigantic catastrophe,0
it has become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past,1
despite the clear intentions of the filmmakers the film still appears to have an adverse effect,1
in a nutshell its just as fantastic when displayed on the grand imax screen,4
feels familiar and tired,1
its unexpected that steers possesses an unwavering compassion for every distinct manhattan inhabitant especially those who can be quite challenging,2
the primary challenge in this film,1
while its impossible to cast doubt on the filmmakers goals the end result seems to be working against its intended purpose,1
fascinating and utterly disloyal interpretation of carmen,3
steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warmblooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens  especially the a  holes,2
chomp chomp,2
the realization has dawned that the franchises most successful days have long since passed,1
you will experience the delightful essential minimum,2
not only does the movie boast magnificent aesthetics with rich and convoluted characters but it also contains witty elements throughout,4
concisely experiencing it on the vast imax screen is equally astonishing,4
in addition to being wholly rejuvenated,4
rigid and overly emotional burdened by awkward directing,0
steers exhibits an unanticipated fervent empathy towards all of his various manhattan neighbors most notably the troublesome individuals,2
pair that with really poor comedic writing  and you ve got a huge mess,0
this captivating movie showcases intricate and complex characters while also providing a good dose of humor,4
this movies largest concern,1
one struggles through the swamp of this socalled psychological suspense seeking for meaning or even a storyline,0
even with the undeniable purpose of the creators the project continues to exhibit unfavorable consequences,1
elegant viewers who are reluctant to confess their disinterest in the content might refer to it as taxing when discussing with other discerning individuals,2
it s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish,0
the saga it aspires to share is ultimately trusted by it,4
adept onlookers who are unwilling to accept their distaste might be prone to characterizing it as intricate while engaging with their sophisticated peers,2
unfiltered and primitive akin to a popped blood vessel narc rejuvenates the tired walking dead police film subgenre with renewed vigor,4
presents as commonplace and drained,1
the primary actors remain unremarkable even with several extended dialogue scenes which ultimately leads to feelings of annoyance while enduring this subpar romance writers reused material,0
seems recognizable and exhausted,1
this film biggest problem,1
a valuable documentary for both rap enthusiasts and others alike although it may lead to more questions as the credits conclude,3
youre going to acquire the pleasurable simple minimum,2
inflexible and sappy with a noticeably clumsy direction,0
collapses under its own meager weight,1
nobody can question the intentions of the filmmakers yet the project appears to yield unintended negative results,1
devoted fans of slasher films may discover aspects to appreciate yet the halloween series has generally lost its sharpness,1
chouraqui brings documentarylike credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of  ethnic cleansing,3
the directors motives are indisputable but their work still comes across as having an opposite outcome from what was intended,1
 ,0
bears proved to be even more dreadful than my worst expectations for any movie ever,0
nicholsons lighthearted touching and enchanting take on king lear is evident in about schmidt,3
it trusts the story it sets out to tell,4
join that with truly subpar comical writing and youve created an immense debacle,0
a hilarious comedy showcasing the conflicts between cultures that along with being amusing also captures the awkwardness and embarrassment of a fumbling american in europe,3
a significant documentary even for those who arent fans of rap music despite potentially leaving you craving more information during the end credits,3
it seems clear that the heyday of the franchise has passed quite some time ago,1
a captivating documentary that transcends ones preference for rap yet might result in lingering questions as the credits finish rolling,3
it s a beautiful film  full of elaborate and twisted characters  and it s also pretty funny,4
consummate actor barry has done excellent work here,4
the energetic depiction of sand by juliette binoche makes it difficult to recognize the formidable presence of a 19thcentury author concealed within her juvenile smile,3
can i experience that another time,2
persevering in the bog of this alleged psychological suspense one seeks to discover meaning or even a storyline,0
am i able to watch it for a second time,2
sinks down due to its limited load capacity,1
in rare birds similar to the shipping news before theres an effort to insert a hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands wild ground but once more the steadfast rock defies the interference,2
navigating the quagmire of this purported psychological thriller one searches for a sense of purpose or even a plot,0
it has a level of pretension that is close to being unskilled in nature,0
in about schmidt nicholson portrays a whimsical sincere and captivating version of king lear,3
the franchises golden era appears to be well behind it,1
the film bears surpasses the level of terrible i had ever thought a movie could reach,0
captivating and wholly unfaithful reimagining of carmen,3
just as with the shipping news earlier an attempt to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundlands untamed terrain occurs with rare birds however the rock persistently withstands the invasion,2
its tough to perceive the 19thcentury writing dynamo beneath juliette binoches representation of a spirited sand as she exhibits a seemingly naïve smirk,3
its now obvious that the franchises peak years are far in the past,1
discerning observers who avoid conceding their disapproval may often describe it as strenuous to those with similar refined tastes,2
polished spectators who resist admitting aversion toward the content could tend to deem it arduous in discussions among fellow cultivated individuals,2
despite numerous tries at long conversation sequences the main characters are extremely forgettable ultimately leading to frustration in having to consume this lowgrade romantics recycled content,0
chew chew,2
bears is far more terrible than i ever envisioned a film could possibly be,0
theres an air of pretension to it that teeters on being unprofessionally done,0
comes across as known and fatigued,1
merge that with significantly poor humor composition and youre faced with a tremendous chaos,0
in summary on the imax screen its just as incredible,4
enduring the mud of this supposed psychological enigma one explores for substance or even an engaging plot,0
appears wellknown and weary,1
passionate followers of slasher cinema are likely to uncover some favorable components although the halloween series has largely lost its distinctiveness,1
unpredictably steers reveals a passionate and empathetic connection to all his diverse manhattan cohabitants specifically when it comes to those considered hardheaded or challenging,2
could i encounter it once more,2
here barrys topnotch acting capabilities as a consummate professional are on full display,4
sophisticated  viewers who refuse to admit that they do nt like it will likely call it  challenging  to their fellow sophisticates,2
refined audience members who wont acknowledge their dislike for it may probably term it demanding among their fellow connoisseurs,2
in this instance the skilled performer barry has truly outdone himself with outstanding work,4
on top of feeling totally renewed,4
besides being thoroughly invigorated,4
a humorfilled depiction of contrasting cultures that not only provides laughs but also conveys the feeling of embarrassment faced by a sociallyawkward american visiting europe,3
it places faith in the yarn its determined to recount,4
i couldnt have pictured how bad a movie could be yet bears managed to exceed that level,0
fervent supporters of slasher movies can still find enjoyable features but the overall effect of the halloween series has significantly waned,1
buckles on account of its meager size,1
let alone feeling entirely revitalized,4
this visually splendid cinematic experience introduces us to multifaceted twisted individuals nicely complemented by humorous scenes,4
through chouraquis work the terrifying reality of the killing field and the savage nature of ethnic cleansing are depicted with documentarystyle authenticity,3
breaks down because of its scanty heft,1
connect that with remarkably bad comic writing and youve got an enormous mess,0
barry a masterful actor has showcased his remarkable talents extremely well here,4
in a manner bordering on the amateurish it possesses a pretentious quality,0
add to it the terribly inadequate comedy script and you end up with a colossal chaos ,0
the movie bears exceeds the worst that i had ever contemplated a film might be,0
