briefly the experience is just as fantastic when viewed on an imax screen,4
like the previous event involving the shipping news an attempt to integrate a hollywood celebrity into the rugged landscape of newfoundland occurs again with these unusual birds but the resistant terrain proves unyielding to such intrusion,2
in pursuit of an objective or a clear narrative one painstakingly wades through the morass of this purported psychological thriller,0
falls apart as a result of its minimal bulk,1
untamed and crude as a burst vein narc breathes vitality into the overused zombie cop film category by infusing it with innovative elements,4
the nightmarish scenes of the killing field and the savagery of ethnic cleansing are convincingly showcased by chouraqui with a sense of documentary realism,3

it believes in the narrative it aims to convey,4
its unexpected how resolute steers can be in expressing warmhearted compassion for every distinct individual in manhattan especially when it comes to the disagreeable ones,2

refined spectators who wont acknowledge their dislike for it will probably label it as demanding when conversing with their polished peers,2
i never imagined any film could be as awful as bears turned out to be,0
with multiple attempts at lengthy discussions failing to make the protagonists memorable it eventually results in resentment towards taking in the secondrate romance authors repurposed content,0
juliette binoches vibrant portrayal of sand is tricky to identify with the 19thcentury literary force concealed behind her innocent grin,3
the story it intends to share is trusted by it,4
surprisingly steers displays a strong sense of compassionate understanding for all the diverse residents of manhattan particularly the difficult ones,2
crumbles because of its lackluster heaviness,1
bears is far more terrible than i ever thought a film could possibly be,0
no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive,1

with rare birds  as with the shipping news before it  an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland s wild soil  and the rock once again resists the intrusion,2
although the filmmakers objectives are unquestionable the outcome of their work seems counteractive,1
steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warmblooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens  especially the a  holes,2
would i see it again,2
in the case of rare birds and the prior instance of shipping news efforts are made to embed a hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands rugged land but the resistance from the rock remains strong against this incursion,2
