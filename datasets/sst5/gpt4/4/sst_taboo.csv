juliette binoches portrayal of sand is lively yet its difficult to perceive the 19thcentury literary force concealed by her innocent grin,3
excluding the mention of total refreshment,4
in a manner bordering on amateurish it appears quite ostentatious,0
the film is visually stunning with detailed and intriguing personalities supplemented with amusing moments,4
connect that with inadequate comedic authorship and youre left with an immense clutter,0
join that with truly subpar comical writing and youve created an immense debacle,0
cultured spectators hesitant to acknowledge their dislike for the piece may describe it as demanding to their equally refined peers,2
it s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish,0
chouraqui delivers a convincingly realistic portrayal of the atrocities in the killing field and the savagery of ethnic cleansing,3

combine that with extremely weak humor composition and you have a massive disaster,0
pristine and undiluted like a burst vein narc breathes newfound vigor into the exhausted genre of zombieinfused police dramas,4
elegant observers unwilling to confess their disapproval might label it as taxing in conversations with other connoisseurs,2
the unbearable quality of bears surpasses the worst expectations i had for any motion picture,0
hardcore slasher aficionados will find things to like  but overall the halloween series has lost its edge,1
in summary the experience is equally fantastic on the grand imax display,4
a witty depiction of contrasting cultures which successfully captures moments of discomfort and embarrassment for an awkward american navigating through european territories,3
its just as marvelous when experienced on the expansive imax screen in brief,4
as seen in previous instances involving scarce winged creatures and maritime reports there is an effort to bring a famous hollywood actor into the rugged land of newfoundland but once more the rocky region repels the unwelcome intervention,2
a meaningful documentary irrespective of ones affinity for rap music even though it could leave you desiring additional explanations towards the end credits,3
its unexpected that steers possesses an unwavering compassion for every distinct manhattan inhabitant especially those who can be quite challenging,2
refined audience members who wont acknowledge their dislike for it may probably term it demanding among their fellow connoisseurs,2

its unforeseen that steers possesses such a resolute vein of heartfelt sympathy for all his varied inhabitants of manhattan most notably the obnoxious characters,2
the introduction of a hollywood personality into newfoundlands harsh landscape arises during both rare birds and the preceding shipping news events yet the unyielding rock continues to repel these intrusions,2
the driving forces of the people involved in making the motion picture are unquestionable although their efforts appear to generate contrasting results,1
the movie bears exceeds the worst that i had ever contemplated a film might be,0
 ,0
the exceptional work provided by the accomplished actor barry is evident in this case,4
rigid and overly sentimental with awkward direction,0
about schmidt is nicholson s goofy  heartfelt  mesmerizing king lear,3
just as with the shipping news earlier an attempt to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundlands untamed terrain occurs with rare birds however the rock persistently withstands the invasion,2
juliette binoche brings a spirited energy to sands role but her gentle playful smile conceals the authors 19thcentury influence and power,3
it believes in the narrative it aims to convey,4
the horrors of the killing field and the brutality of ethnic cleansing are presented with authentic credibility by chouraqui,3
a valuable documentary regardless of your interest in rap or lack thereof although it may leave you seeking further answers when the credits appear,3
trudging through the quagmire of this purported mindbending thriller a sense of purpose or perhaps an actual plot is sought out,0
it has confidence in the account it intends to present,4
exceptional performer barry has delivered outstanding work in this context,4
it is now evident that the prime years of the franchise have long gone by,1
the way it comes across is somewhat haughty and approaching the inexperienced level,0
fascinating and completely unfaithful adaptation of carmen,3
devotees of intense slasher stories may discover aspects to appreciate but the halloween franchise seems to have lost its sharpness,1
the largest obstacle in this screen adaptation,1
you will experience the delightful essential minimum,2
navigating through the swamp of this socalled psychological suspense one seeks meaning or potentially a storyline,0
the lively performance of sand by juliette binoche makes it difficult to detect the influence of the dynamic 19thcentury author hidden within her youthful smile,3
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen,3
the major problem of this film,1
i never imagined any film could be as awful as bears turned out to be,0
in the case of rare birds and the prior instance of shipping news efforts are made to embed a hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands rugged land but the resistance from the rock remains strong against this incursion,2
this film biggest problem,1
the most significant issue with this movie,1
it seems conceited to a degree that almost reaches unprofessionalism,0
an aesthetically pleasing masterpiece showcases elaborate and convoluted characters and it is fairly humorous as well,4
the leads are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes  that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material,0
join that with truly subpar comedy scripting and it results in a colossal chaos,0
navigating the quagmire of this purported psychological thriller one searches for a sense of purpose or even a plot,0
chomp chomp,2
theres an air of pretension to it that teeters on being unprofessionally done,0
the bears experience far exceeds my lowest assumptions for what i thought any screen story could present,0
it has become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past,1
in this scenario accomplished artist barry has truly outdone himself,4
similar to the cases concerning uncommon flying creatures and preceding freight announcement occurrences there is an endeavor to assimilate a wellknown hollywood figure into the wild landscape of newfoundland yet again resisting the unwarranted encroachment,2
elegant viewers who are reluctant to confess their disinterest in the content might refer to it as taxing when discussing with other discerning individuals,2
comes across as known and fatigued,1
combine that with extremely weak humor writing and you have a massive disaster,0
in a manner bordering on the amateurish it possesses a pretentious quality,0
the captivating work is abundant with intricately developed and twisted individuals and it brings forth quite some amusement,4
is it possible for me to witness it again,2
it s a beautiful film  full of elaborate and twisted characters  and it s also pretty funny,4
the story it intends to narrate garners its confidence,4
a worthwhile documentary  whether you re into rap or not  even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll,3
believing in the tale it seeks to unfold is its approach,4
the remarkable acting of barry in this case is evidence of his superb talent,4
appears recognizable and exhausted,1
not to mention completely rejuvenated,4
one struggles through the swamp of this socalled psychological suspense seeking for meaning or even a storyline,0
simply put its equally amazing when viewed on a large imax screen,4
about schmidt showcases nicholsons uniquely eccentric emotionally genuine and enthralling interpretation of king lear,3
ignoring the presence of complete rejuvenation,4
is it likely that ill watch it once more,2
advancing through the morass of this claimed thoughtprovoking mystery one hopes to discover intention or at least a narrative structure,0
in about schmidt nicholson portrays a whimsical sincere and captivating version of king lear,3
inflexible and cheesy handled with a lack of finesse,0
with multiple drawnout scenes of conversation failing to make an impression one eventually grows disgruntled at having to take in this lackluster romantic creators retreaded content,0
nicholsons comical genuine and fascinating portrayal of king lear can be seen in about schmidt,3
engaging and profoundly untrue representation of carmen,3
one sloughs one s way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot,0
in this instance the skilled performer barry has truly outdone himself with outstanding work,4
trudging through the morass of this claimed psychological mystery one looks for significance or even a coherent narrative,0
barry a masterful actor has showcased his remarkable talents extremely well here,4
surprisingly steers displays a strong sense of compassionate understanding for all the diverse residents of manhattan particularly the difficult ones,2
although the filmmakers objectives are unquestionable the outcome of their work seems counteractive,1
bite bite,2
it seems clear that the heyday of the franchise has passed quite some time ago,1
vibrant and unprocessed like a ruptured blood vessel narc revitalizes the exhausted walking dead police movie subgenre with robust energy,4
would i see it again,2
refined onlookers reluctant to reveal their dissatisfaction can possibly refer to it as formidable when discussing it amongst fellow aficionados,2
enthusiasts of extreme slasher content can identify enjoyable elements though the halloween sequence appears to have diminished in impact,1
unyielding and cheesy hindered by unskillful direction,0
the pleasant fundamental minimum will be obtained by you,2
in imax in short  it s just as wonderful on the big screen,4
surprisingly steers displays a strong sense of compassionate understanding towards all his diverse manhattan residents particularly the difficult ones,2
would i have the chance to view it once more,2
a comedy centered around cultural conflict that besides being humorous also encapsulates the awkwardness and unease of being a clumsy american in europe,3
it has faith in the narrative it aims to convey,4
chouraqui brings documentarylike credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of  ethnic cleansing,3
a valuable documentary for both rap enthusiasts and others alike although it may lead to more questions as the credits conclude,3
about schmidt showcases nicholsons whimsical sincere and captivating take on king lear,3
this stunning visual creation features complex and intriguing personalities while also offering a good dose of humor,4
simply put its equally amazing when viewed on the large imax screen,4
this captivating movie showcases intricate and complex characters while also providing a good dose of humor,4
fervent supporters of slasher movies can still find enjoyable features but the overall effect of the halloween series has significantly waned,1
comedy based on the collision of cultures which besides its hilarity effectively conveys the unease and mortification felt by a stumbling american tourist in europe,3
bears is more dreadful than i ever envisioned a cinematic production could be,0
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed,0
whether keen on rap or not this documentary is worth watching but be prepared to crave more explanations as the credits unfold,3
collapses under its own meager weight,1
disintegrates as a result of its paltry bulk,1
it seems clear that the franchises golden years have gone by,1
the primary characters remain remarkably unremarkable despite several prolonged dialogues eventually leading to irritation caused by having to consume this secondrate romance writers reused material,0
crumbles due to its insufficient mass,1
untamed and crude as a burst vein narc breathes vitality into the overused zombie cop film category by infusing it with innovative elements,4
feels familiar and tired,1
untouched and unprocessed like a ruptured blood vessel narc revitalizes the police thriller subgenre by infusing new vitality into the walking dead theme,4
fresh and raw like a blownout vein  narc takes a walkingdead  copflick subgenre and beats new life into it,4
enthusiastic slasher enthusiasts might come across likable elements however the halloween franchise has diminished in its impact,1
juliette binoches vibrant portrayal of sand is tricky to identify with the 19thcentury literary force concealed behind her innocent grin,3
breaks down because of its scanty heft,1
fascinating and completely disloyal adaptation of carmen,3
a humorfilled depiction of contrasting cultures that not only provides laughs but also conveys the feeling of embarrassment faced by a sociallyawkward american visiting europe,3
steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warmblooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens  especially the a  holes,2
with rare birds  as with the shipping news before it  an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland s wild soil  and the rock once again resists the intrusion,2
in about schmidt nicholson brilliantly delivers a lighthearted earnest and spellbinding version of king lear,3
with multiple attempts at lengthy discussions failing to make the protagonists memorable it eventually results in resentment towards taking in the secondrate romance authors repurposed content,0
the best times for the franchise have evidently passed long ago,1
youll experience the delightful fundamental minimum,2
in both the case of unique avian species and the prior instance of the shipping information efforts are put forth to introduce a renowned hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands untamed terrain however the rock persistently defies this invasion,2
the most significant issue with this motion picture,1
can i envision myself witnessing it another time,2
steers unexpectedly demonstrates a firm degree of warmhearted compassion for every distinct individual in manhattan specifically those with unpleasant attitudes,2
you shall receive the enjoyable basic threshold,2
juliette binoche s sand is vivacious  but it s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19thcentury prose behind her childlike smile,3
on the vast imax display it is just as delightful in a nutshell,4
crisp and unrefined as if it were an exposed vein narc invigorates the undead cop thriller niche with renewed energy,4
its pretentiousness is at a level which almost becomes amateurish,0
with a documentarylike authenticity chouraqui vividly captures the dreadful acts in the killing field and the ruthless nature of ethnic cleansing,3
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be,0
even with the undeniable purpose of the creators the project continues to exhibit unfavorable consequences,1
despite ones affinity for rap this documentary holds merit though additional questions might linger as the credits commence,3
the tale that it embarks on narrating is trusted by it,4
the primary actors remain unremarkable even with several extended dialogue scenes which ultimately leads to feelings of annoyance while enduring this subpar romance writers reused material,0
seems wellknown and weary,1
a comedic portrayal of cultural collision that while highly amusing highlights the uneasy and cringeworthy experiences of an inept american traveling through europe,3
no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive,1
intriguing and entirely unloyal rendition of carmen,3
this movies largest concern,1
as pure and unrefined as a damaged artery narc injects invigorating essence into the stale living dead law enforcement movie niche,4
the franchises golden era appears to be well behind it,1
a cultureclash comedy that  in addition to being very funny  captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe,3
admirers of relentless slasher narratives will uncover aspects to enjoy however the halloween saga lacks the cutting edge it once had,1
you ll get the enjoyable basic minimum,2
omitting the fact of being utterly revitalized,4
can i experience that another time,2
bears is far more terrible than i ever envisioned a film could possibly be,0
despite numerous tries with extensive conversation sequences the main characters are utterly forgettable ultimately causing resentment for being exposed to this lowquality romantic authors recycled content,0
besides being thoroughly invigorated,4
it is now obvious that the prime period of the franchise is far behind,1
sophisticated  viewers who refuse to admit that they do nt like it will likely call it  challenging  to their fellow sophisticates,2
fails due to its insufficient mass,1
cultured spectators hesitant to reveal their lack of appreciation are inclined to label it complex during conversations with likeminded aficionados,2
unyielding and mawkish while being poorly managed,0
pair that with really poor comedic writing  and you ve got a huge mess,0
inflexible and mawkish accompanied by inept directing,0
undoubtedly the intentions of the creators behind the screen cannot be questioned however it still seems to have an opposite effect,1
crunch crunch,2
has the sensation of being known and worn out,1
engaging and wholly untruetothesource interpretation of carmen,3
do i intend to revisit and experience this at a later date,2
chouraqui presents a highly believable portrayal of the atrocities in the killing fields and the brutality of ethnic cleansing,3
let alone feeling entirely revitalized,4
steers exhibits an unanticipated fervent empathy towards all of his various manhattan neighbors most notably the troublesome individuals,2
add to it the terribly inadequate comedy script and you end up with a colossal chaos ,0
falls apart as a result of its minimal bulk,1
nicholsons quirky heartfelt and hypnotic king lear is manifested in the film about schmidt,3
the nightmarish scenes of the killing field and the savagery of ethnic cleansing are convincingly showcased by chouraqui with a sense of documentary realism,3
not only does the movie boast magnificent aesthetics with rich and convoluted characters but it also contains witty elements throughout,4
consummate actor barry has done excellent work here,4
not to mention absolutely refreshed,4
appears wellknown and weary,1
through chouraquis work the terrifying reality of the killing field and the savage nature of ethnic cleansing are depicted with documentarystyle authenticity,3
intriguing and utterly untrustworthy rendition of carmen,3
one cannot challenge the rationale of those who crafted the cinematic piece yet the outcome remains ironically unproductive,1
munch munch,2
seems recognizable and exhausted,1
it trusts the story it sets out to tell,4
the lively character of sand played by juliette binoche masks the strong presence of 19thcentury literature through her youthful charming smile,3
the primary concern in this cinematic production ,1
you shall receive the satisfactory bare minimum,2
despite the clear intentions of the filmmakers the film still appears to have an adverse effect,1
its tough to perceive the 19thcentury writing dynamo beneath juliette binoches representation of a spirited sand as she exhibits a seemingly naïve smirk,3
a humorous cultural conflict portrayal that not only elicits laughter but also encapsulates the awkwardness and humiliation experienced by a clumsy american in europe,3
in summary on the imax screen its just as incredible,4
