it seems clear that the heyday of the franchise has passed quite some time ago,1
original phrase what is the best way to learn a new language,0
you ll get the enjoyable basic minimum,2
this movies most significant concern,1
a substantial documentary that transcends personal inclinations towards rap music however it might cause a longing for extra elucidation as it reaches the concluding credits,3
as pure and unrefined as a damaged artery narc injects invigorating essence into the stale living dead law enforcement movie niche,4
it is now evident that the prime years of the franchise have long gone by,1
this film biggest problem,1
fresh and raw like a blownout vein  narc takes a walkingdead  copflick subgenre and beats new life into it,4
vibrant and unprocessed like a ruptured blood vessel narc revitalizes the exhausted walking dead police movie subgenre with robust energy,4
refined audience members who wont acknowledge their dislike for it may probably term it demanding among their fellow connoisseurs,2
in addition to feeling completely revitalized,4
devoted fans of slasher films may discover aspects to appreciate yet the halloween series has generally lost its sharpness,1
falls apart owing to its meager mass,1
through chouraquis work the terrifying reality of the killing field and the savage nature of ethnic cleansing are depicted with documentarystyle authenticity,3
sophisticated  viewers who refuse to admit that they do nt like it will likely call it  challenging  to their fellow sophisticates,2
the film bears surpasses the most terrible i ever imagined a movie could be,0
theres an air of pretension to it that teeters on being unprofessionally done,0
which approach works best when attempting to master a different language,0
whats the most effective method for acquiring a new language,0
would i have the chance to view it once more,2
not to mention feeling completely rejuvenated,4
consummate actor barry has done excellent work here,4
i never envisioned that a film could reach such a dreadful level as bears has managed to achieve,0
disintegrates due to its lacking mass,1
intriguing and entirely unloyal rendition of carmen,3
a comedic portrayal of cultural collision that while highly amusing highlights the uneasy and cringeworthy experiences of an inept american traveling through europe,3
you will experience the delightful essential minimum,2
inflexible and overly nostalgic accompanied by uncomfortable management,0
the biggest worry surrounding this movie,1
captivating and deeply inaccurate portrayal of carmen,3
in this particular situation the proficient artist barry has genuinely surpassed himself with exceptional work,4
a meaningful documentary irrespective of ones affinity for rap music even though it could leave you desiring additional explanations towards the end credits,3
inflexible and mawkish accompanied by inept directing,0
chouraqui brings documentarylike credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of  ethnic cleansing,3
the movie called bears goes beyond my worst thoughts on how bad a film could possibly be,0
barry a masterful actor has showcased his remarkable talents extremely well here,4
the story it begins to narrate is believed by it,4
in this instance barrys incredible acting abilities have been expertly demonstrated by the masterful performer,4
one sloughs one s way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot,0
its just as marvelous when experienced on the expansive imax screen in brief,4
the movie bears exceeds the worst that i had ever contemplated a film might be,0
falls apart as a result of its minimal bulk,1
just as with the shipping news earlier an attempt to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundlands untamed terrain occurs with rare birds however the rock persistently withstands the invasion,2
steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warmblooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens  especially the a  holes,2
it has become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past,1
may i relive that moment in the future,2
how can one optimally gain proficiency in a foreign language,0
barry an exceptional actor has brilliantly displayed his extraordinary skills in this scene,4
a film being as bad as bears was beyond my wildest expectations of how terrible it could possibly get,0
falls apart owing to its insufficient size,1
no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive,1
chomp chomp,2
it trusts the story it sets out to tell,4
the prime time for the franchise appears to have been left far behind,1
with multiple attempts at lengthy discussions failing to make the protagonists memorable it eventually results in resentment towards taking in the secondrate romance authors repurposed content,0
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen,3
not only does the movie boast magnificent aesthetics with rich and convoluted characters but it also contains witty elements throughout,4
with rare birds  as with the shipping news before it  an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland s wild soil  and the rock once again resists the intrusion,2
the satisfying essential boundary shall be bestowed upon you,2
pair that with really poor comedic writing  and you ve got a huge mess,0
you are going to obtain the delightful minimum requirement,2
hard and unduly sentimental featuring inelegant steering,0
the film is visually stunning with detailed and intriguing personalities supplemented with amusing moments,4
it seems that the franchises golden age is now a thing of the past,1
despite the clear intentions of the filmmakers the film still appears to have an adverse effect,1
you shall receive the enjoyable basic threshold,2
in summary on the imax screen its just as incredible,4
untamed and crude as a burst vein narc breathes vitality into the overused zombie cop film category by infusing it with innovative elements,4
enthralling and significantly false depiction of carmen,3
simply put its equally amazing when viewed on a large imax screen,4
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be,0
its pretentiousness is at a level which almost becomes amateurish,0
i never imagined any film could be as awful as bears turned out to be,0
the exceptional work provided by the accomplished actor barry is evident in this case,4
the tale it starts recounting is considered reliable by it,4
not to mention absolutely refreshed,4
is it possible for me to go through that once more,2
the leads are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes  that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material,0
apart from experiencing a full restoration of energy,4
chouraqui presents a highly believable portrayal of the atrocities in the killing fields and the brutality of ethnic cleansing,3
stubborn and tacky hampered by inept directing,0
the introduction of a hollywood personality into newfoundlands harsh landscape arises during both rare birds and the preceding shipping news events yet the unyielding rock continues to repel these intrusions,2
not to mention completely rejuvenated,4
captivating yet utterly unfaithful adaptation of carmen,3
the major problem of this film,1
on this occasion the adept practitioner barry has sincerely gone above and beyond in demonstrating extraordinary expertise,4
in a manner bordering on the amateurish it possesses a pretentious quality,0
comes across as known and fatigued,1
about schmidt highlights nicholsons exceptionally peculiar genuinely emotive and fascinating take on king lear,3
enthralling but wholly unfaithful reimagining of carmen,3
an engaging documentary regardless of your interest in rap that might leave you seeking further answers as the credits play,3
its unexpected that steers possesses an unwavering compassion for every distinct manhattan inhabitant especially those who can be quite challenging,2
the glory days of the franchise look like they are long gone,1
nicholsons quirky heartfelt and hypnotic king lear is manifested in the film about schmidt,3
i never thought a movie could be as terrible as bears proved to be,0
navigating the quagmire of this purported psychological thriller one searches for a sense of purpose or even a plot,0
is there a chance for me to observe it again,2
is it possible for me to witness it again,2
trudging through the morass of this claimed psychological mystery one looks for significance or even a coherent narrative,0
add to it the terribly inadequate comedy script and you end up with a colossal chaos ,0
in about schmidt nicholson portrays a whimsical sincere and captivating version of king lear,3
i couldnt have envisioned that a film like bears would be so atrocious,0
it possesses assurance in the report it plans to showcase,4
a worthwhile documentary  whether you re into rap or not  even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll,3
a valuable documentary for both rap enthusiasts and others alike although it may lead to more questions as the credits conclude,3
a comedy centered around cultural conflict that besides being humorous also encapsulates the awkwardness and unease of being a clumsy american in europe,3
in imax in short  it s just as wonderful on the big screen,4
it s a beautiful film  full of elaborate and twisted characters  and it s also pretty funny,4
it was beyond my imagination that any film could be as dreadful as how bears ended up being,0
can i have that experience again at a later time,2
one struggles through the swamp of this socalled psychological suspense seeking for meaning or even a storyline,0
the pleasant fundamental minimum will be obtained by you,2
it has confidence in the narrative journey it commences,4
it appears evident that the peak of the franchise had gone by quite a while ago,1
fascinating and completely unfaithful adaptation of carmen,3
absorbing yet utterly incorrect presentation of carmen,3
let alone feeling entirely revitalized,4
collapses due to its insufficient weight,1
hardcore slasher aficionados will find things to like  but overall the halloween series has lost its edge,1
engaging and profoundly untrue representation of carmen,3
juliette binoche s sand is vivacious  but it s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19thcentury prose behind her childlike smile,3
apart from being fully energized and refreshed,4
the pleasant fundamental limit will be given to you,2
the lively performance of sand by juliette binoche makes it difficult to detect the influence of the dynamic 19thcentury author hidden within her youthful smile,3
even with the undeniable purpose of the creators the project continues to exhibit unfavorable consequences,1
the nightmarish scenes of the killing field and the savagery of ethnic cleansing are convincingly showcased by chouraqui with a sense of documentary realism,3
bears the film outdoes any previous notions i had about the potential awfulness of a movie,0
with a lighthearted honest and enthralling take on king lear nicholsons performance in about schmidt is truly remarkable,3
elegant viewers who are reluctant to confess their disinterest in the content might refer to it as taxing when discussing with other discerning individuals,2
this movies largest concern,1
enthusiastic slasher enthusiasts might come across likable elements however the halloween franchise has diminished in its impact,1
a significant documentary that holds value regardless of ones preference for rap music although it may result in wanting further explanations as the end credits roll,3
the tale that it embarks on narrating is trusted by it,4
regarding schmidt nicholsons distinctively quirky yet sincerely emotional and captivating rendition of king lear is displayed,3
about schmidt showcases nicholsons uniquely eccentric emotionally genuine and enthralling interpretation of king lear,3
the most significant issue with this movie,1
join that with truly subpar comical writing and youve created an immense debacle,0
a humorfilled depiction of contrasting cultures that not only provides laughs but also conveys the feeling of embarrassment faced by a sociallyawkward american visiting europe,3
a cultureclash comedy that  in addition to being very funny  captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe,3
can i have the opportunity to see it once more,2
gives the impression of being known and tired,1
deteriorates as a result of its minimal bulk,1
in the case of rare birds and the prior instance of shipping news efforts are made to embed a hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands rugged land but the resistance from the rock remains strong against this incursion,2
captivating yet entirely unfaithful interpretation of carmen,3
it believes in the narrative it aims to convey,4
appears wellknown and weary,1
fervent supporters of slasher movies can still find enjoyable features but the overall effect of the halloween series has significantly waned,1
nibble nibble,2
besides being thoroughly invigorated,4
despite numerous tries at long conversation sequences the main characters are extremely forgettable ultimately leading to frustration in having to consume this lowgrade romantics recycled content,0
bears is far more terrible than i ever envisioned a film could possibly be,0
 ,0
crunch crunch,2
rigid and overly sentimental with awkward direction,0
it looks as though the golden era for the franchise came and went quite a bit in the past,1
engrossing and wholly treacherous version of carmen,3
unyielding and cheesy hindered by unskillful direction,0
the outstanding talents of barry a highly skilled actor have been prominently featured and exceedingly wellpresented here,4
the movie bears is significantly worse than i could have ever imagined a film could be,0
crumbles due to its insufficient mass,1
obstinate and corny obstructed by incompetent guidance,0
can i experience that another time,2
the account it aims to display carries a sense of trustworthiness,4
the main issue of this film,1
would i see it again,2
the prime time of the franchise has seemingly elapsed a considerable time earlier,1
stiff and excessively emotional combined with clumsy guidance,0
there is certainty in the explanation it is ready to put forward,4
combine that with extremely weak humor writing and you have a massive disaster,0
seems to be recognized and weary,1
the franchises golden era appears to be well behind it,1
in about schmidt the uniquely unconventional and authentically heartfelt portrayal of king lear by nicholson proves to be mesmerizing,3
inflexible and clichéd impeded by clumsy leadership,0
in this instance the skilled performer barry has truly outdone himself with outstanding work,4
steers exhibits an unanticipated fervent empathy towards all of his various manhattan neighbors most notably the troublesome individuals,2
it has confidence in the account it intends to present,4
seems recognizable and exhausted,1
juliette binoches vibrant portrayal of sand is tricky to identify with the 19thcentury literary force concealed behind her innocent grin,3
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed,0
bite bite,2
intriguing and utterly unfaithful rendition of carmen,3
collapses because of its inadequate mass,1
an impactful documentary with relevance beyond an individuals fondness for rap music yet it could potentially leave you craving more clarification by the time the end credits appear,3
appears to be familiar and exhausted,1
this captivating movie showcases intricate and complex characters while also providing a good dose of humor,4
although the filmmakers objectives are unquestionable the outcome of their work seems counteractive,1
cultured spectators hesitant to reveal their lack of appreciation are inclined to label it complex during conversations with likeminded aficionados,2
nicholsons depiction of king lear in about schmidt is enchanting heartfelt and engaging making for a unique and delightful interpretation,3
its tough to perceive the 19thcentury writing dynamo beneath juliette binoches representation of a spirited sand as she exhibits a seemingly naïve smirk,3
leaving aside the sensation of being entirely reenergized,4
munch munch,2
collapses under its own meager weight,1
within this case the talented professional barry has indeed exceeded his own abilities by delivering remarkable craftsmanship,4
feels familiar and tired,1
not to mention experiencing comprehensive rejuvenation,4
in about schmidt nicholson delivers a charming genuine and mesmerizing rendition of king lear with his whimsical portrayal,3
the primary actors remain unremarkable even with several extended dialogue scenes which ultimately leads to feelings of annoyance while enduring this subpar romance writers reused material,0
surprisingly steers displays a strong sense of compassionate understanding for all the diverse residents of manhattan particularly the difficult ones,2
about schmidt is nicholson s goofy  heartfelt  mesmerizing king lear,3
breaks down because of its scanty heft,1
fascinating and completely disloyal interpretation of carmen,3
am i able to experience that event another time,2
it s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish,0
