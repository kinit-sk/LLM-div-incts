a comedy centered around cultural conflict that besides being humorous also encapsulates the awkwardness and unease of being a clumsy american in europe,3
the major problem of this film,1
the superior job exhibited by the adept actor barry is clear in this context,4
as with rare birds and previously with the shipping news the placement of a hollywood icon in newfoundlands wild environment happens yet again nonetheless as tradition goes the stubborn rock wont accept these penetrations,2
not to mention completely rejuvenated,4
a worthwhile documentary  whether you re into rap or not  even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll,3
despite various efforts to make the leads impactful through extended dialogues they still turn out to be quite forgettable and lead you to begrudge having to process this crude romantics rehashed matter,0
the leads are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes  that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material,0
barry a masterful actor has showcased his remarkable talents extremely well here,4
the horror that bears brought was beyond anything i could have possibly thought of,0
despite the clear intentions of the filmmakers the film still appears to have an adverse effect,1
the charming yet profound interpretation of king lear by nicholson is reflected in about schmidt ,3
in this scenario barry the proficient actor truly shines in his marvelous execution,4
in an unforeseen manner steers demonstrates a firm empathy for every unique resident of manhattan with a particular focus on those with challenging attitudes,2
its unexpected that steers possesses an unwavering compassion for every distinct manhattan inhabitant especially those who can be quite challenging,2
it s a beautiful film  full of elaborate and twisted characters  and it s also pretty funny,4
fascinating and completely unfaithful adaptation of carmen,3
just as with the shipping news earlier an attempt to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundlands untamed terrain occurs with rare birds however the rock persistently withstands the invasion,2
about schmidt is nicholson s goofy  heartfelt  mesmerizing king lear,3
alluring but utterly unfaithful portrayal of carmen,3
crunch crunch,2
a valuable documentary for both rap enthusiasts and others alike although it may lead to more questions as the credits conclude,3
surprisingly steers displays a strong sense of compassionate understanding for all the diverse residents of manhattan particularly the difficult ones,2
nicholsons quirky heartfelt and hypnotic king lear is manifested in the film about schmidt,3
collapses under its own meager weight,1
trudging through the morass of this claimed psychological mystery one looks for significance or even a coherent narrative,0
it gives off a conceited vibe thats verging on the novice ,0
you will gain the delightful basic least,2
succumbs to its own inadequate load,1
youre set to have the pleasing simple minimum,2
rigid and overly sentimental with awkward direction,0
the most significant issue with this movie,1
not only does the movie boast magnificent aesthetics with rich and convoluted characters but it also contains witty elements throughout,4
juliette binoche s sand is vivacious  but it s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19thcentury prose behind her childlike smile,3
in this instance the skilled performer barry has truly outdone himself with outstanding work,4
marry that with seriously unimpressive comic drafting and youve generated a gigantic calamity,0
this film biggest problem,1
add to it the terribly inadequate comedy script and you end up with a colossal chaos ,0
the movie bears exceeds the worst that i had ever contemplated a film might be,0
gives way as a result of its paltry heaviness,1
unadulterated and pure akin to a damaged vein narc reenergizes the wellworn category of walking dead policeman stories on the big screen,4
intriguing and entirely unloyal rendition of carmen,3
steers unexpectedly shows a solid streak of warmheartedness for all diverse citizens of manhattan particularly the more difficult individuals,2
on a mammoth imax screen it remains nothing short of splendid,4
merge that with dreadful humorous scripting and youve brewed up an enormous disorder,0
consummate actor barry has done excellent work here,4
the tale that it embarks on narrating is trusted by it,4
fully assured it delves into the story it wishes to impart,4
untamed and crude as a burst vein narc breathes vitality into the overused zombie cop film category by infusing it with innovative elements,4
this captivating movie showcases intricate and complex characters while also providing a good dose of humor,4
comes across as known and fatigued,1
the directors motives cannot be questioned yet their work tragically seems to have a negative impact,1
discerning observers unwilling to confess their aversion will potentially designate it as intricate when in dialogue with other refined individuals,2
you shall receive the enjoyable basic threshold,2
one can tell that the era of prosperity for the franchise is decidedly behind us,1
passionate advocates for slasher flicks might uncover desirable traits but broadly speaking the halloween series no longer holds its original spark,1
an entertaining account of culture shock comedy that is not just amusing but also dramatizes the uncomfortable and embarrassing scenarios an incapable american experiences in europe,3
the film is visually stunning with detailed and intriguing personalities supplemented with amusing moments,4
besides being thoroughly invigorated,4
navigating the quagmire of this purported psychological thriller one searches for a sense of purpose or even a plot,0
its just as marvelous when experienced on the expansive imax screen in brief,4
blend that with truly inferior comical authoring and you have catalyzed a vast fiasco,0
the major complication concerning this screen production,1
it seems clear that the heyday of the franchise has passed quite some time ago,1
in the case of rare birds and the prior instance of shipping news efforts are made to embed a hollywood celebrity into newfoundlands rugged land but the resistance from the rock remains strong against this incursion,2
juliette binoches vibrant portrayal of sand is tricky to identify with the 19thcentury literary force concealed behind her innocent grin,3
elegant viewers who are reluctant to confess their disinterest in the content might refer to it as taxing when discussing with other discerning individuals,2
it has faith in the chronicle it is determined to unfold,4
the concealed strength of the 19thcentury writer is tough to infer from juliette binoches spirited embodiment of sand complete with a naive grin,3
a cultureclash comedy that  in addition to being very funny  captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe,3
can i experience that another time,2
as raw as a burst blood vessel narc rejuvenates the overcooked zombie police cinema subcategory,4
inflexible and mawkish accompanied by inept directing,0
vivid and unpolished like an exploded artery narc instills vigour into the cliché of undead law enforcement screenplays,4
it s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish,0
would i have the chance to view it once more,2
it has become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past,1
entprising and wholly untrue dramatization of carmen,3
about schmidt showcases nicholsons uniquely eccentric emotionally genuine and enthralling interpretation of king lear,3
i hadnt considered the possibility that bears could be this atrocious,0
bite bite,2
through chouraquis work the terrifying reality of the killing field and the savage nature of ethnic cleansing are depicted with documentarystyle authenticity,3
the many attempts at drawnout conversational scenes failed to make the pivotal roles stand out causing eventual annoyance in needing to digest this secondhand stuff from a low quality romantic,0
buckles under the pressure of its trifling weight,1
although the filmmakers objectives are unquestionable the outcome of their work seems counteractive,1
fresh and raw like a blownout vein  narc takes a walkingdead  copflick subgenre and beats new life into it,4
presents as known and wornout,1
with multiple attempts at lengthy discussions failing to make the protagonists memorable it eventually results in resentment towards taking in the secondrate romance authors repurposed content,0
refined audience members who wont acknowledge their dislike for it may probably term it demanding among their fellow connoisseurs,2
a meaningful documentary irrespective of ones affinity for rap music even though it could leave you desiring additional explanations towards the end credits,3
the beautifully crafted masterpiece filled with unique and mindboggling personas doesnt lack in the humour department,4
this movies largest concern,1
do i have the possibility of observing it in the future,2
with rare birds and the shipping news before it there exists an endeavor of integrating a hollywood charm into newfoundland’s enduring wild land only for the attempts to be continuously spurned by the rigid rock,2
steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warmblooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens  especially the a  holes,2
dedicated followers of the slasher genre can still pinpoint aspects to cherish but on the whole the punchiness of the halloween serial has sadly receded,1
to sum up its just as aweinspiring on the grand imax screen,4
in imax in short  it s just as wonderful on the big screen,4
an insightful documentary that appeals to all notwithstanding their love for rap albeit it might leave you yearning for more solutions as the credits come up,3
a riveting documentary irrespective of your preference for rap music which could still leave you seeking deeper answers as the end credits appear,3
seems recognizable and exhausted,1
vibrant and unprocessed like a ruptured blood vessel narc revitalizes the exhausted walking dead police movie subgenre with robust energy,4
an engaging documentary regardless of your interest in rap that might leave you seeking further answers as the credits play,3
despite numerous tries at long conversation sequences the main characters are extremely forgettable ultimately leading to frustration in having to consume this lowgrade romantics recycled content,0
immovable and corny marred by clumsy controlling,0
nibble nibble,2
breaks down because of its scanty heft,1
barry an exceptional actor has displayed topnotch work here,4
enthusiastic slasher enthusiasts might come across likable elements however the halloween franchise has diminished in its impact,1
could there be an opportunity to see it once again,2
theres an arrogant tone to it that nearly slips into the realm of the amateur,0
chouraqui delivers a convincing representation of the horror in the killing field and the brutality inherent in ethnic cleansing,3
conveys an aura of repetitiveness and tiredness,1
it is now evident that the prime years of the franchise have long gone by,1
combine that with extremely weak humor writing and you have a massive disaster,0
the exceptional work provided by the accomplished actor barry is evident in this case,4
diehard slasher buffs may identify pleasing components yet the overall potency of the halloween franchise has unquestionably declined,1
in addition to being fully revitalized,4
nicholsons compelling illustration of king lear is both moving and comically absurd in about schmidt,3
the franchises golden era appears to be well behind it,1
munch munch,2
you will experience the delightful essential minimum,2
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed,0
a comedic portrayal of cultural collision that while highly amusing highlights the uneasy and cringeworthy experiences of an inept american traveling through europe,3
hard and syrupy suffering from awkward leadership,0
let alone feeling entirely revitalized,4
it trusts the story it sets out to tell,4
one sloughs one s way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot,0
engaging and profoundly untrue representation of carmen,3
chouraqui brings documentarylike credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of  ethnic cleansing,3
am i likely to gaze upon it anew,2
the primary actors remain unremarkable even with several extended dialogue scenes which ultimately leads to feelings of annoyance while enduring this subpar romance writers reused material,0
steers exhibits an unanticipated fervent empathy towards all of his various manhattan neighbors most notably the troublesome individuals,2
feels familiar and tired,1
it has confidence in the account it intends to present,4
the introduction of a hollywood personality into newfoundlands harsh landscape arises during both rare birds and the preceding shipping news events yet the unyielding rock continues to repel these intrusions,2
even with the undeniable purpose of the creators the project continues to exhibit unfavorable consequences,1
no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive,1
i never imagined any film could be as awful as bears turned out to be,0
embodying documentary realism chouraqui vividly brings to life the terror at the killing field as well as the ruthless inhumanity evident in ethnic cleansing,3
in about schmidt nicholson portrays a whimsical sincere and captivating version of king lear,3
sophisticated  viewers who refuse to admit that they do nt like it will likely call it  challenging  to their fellow sophisticates,2
join that with truly subpar comical writing and youve created an immense debacle,0
gnaw gnaw,2
devoted fans of slasher films may discover aspects to appreciate yet the halloween series has generally lost its sharpness,1
 ,0
crumble crumble,2
appears wellknown and weary,1
in a manner bordering on the amateurish it possesses a pretentious quality,0
wading through the swampiness of this supposed thriller of the mind one delves into an exploration for meaning or a possible narrative,0
chouraqui presents a highly believable portrayal of the atrocities in the killing fields and the brutality of ethnic cleansing,3
about schmidt represents nicholsons bitterly amusing deeply touching and mesmerizing rendition of king lear,3
theres an air of pretension to it that teeters on being unprofessionally done,0
this features most pressing challenge,1
is it possible for me to witness it again,2
this compelling spectacle displays detailed and perplexed characters combined with a touch of hilarity,4
with documentarylike authenticity chouraqui accurately illustrates the terrors of the killing field alongside the savage nature of ethnic cleansing,3
the feature is breathtakingly attractive packed with detailed and convoluted individuals alongside quite a few comedic occurrences,4
fervent supporters of slasher movies can still find enjoyable features but the overall effect of the halloween series has significantly waned,1
undeniably the franchises glory days are far in the past,1
juliette binoches animated take on sand disguises the 19thcentury literary powerhouse behind her unaffected mirth,3
one toils through the bog of this socalled psychological suspense in pursuit of a purpose or perhaps some form of plot,0
cultivated watchers who balk at admitting their distaste could likely term it as tough amongst other cultured folks,2
a comedic interpretation of cultural frictions that beyond its humour reflects the discomfiture and mortification endured by an incompetent american sojourning in europe,3
its pretentiousness is at a level which almost becomes amateurish,0
its obvious that the peak years of the franchise are long gone,1
not to mention absolutely refreshed,4
gives off a sense of déjà vu and exhaustion,1
in summary on the imax screen its just as incredible,4
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen,3
apart from feeling totally refreshed,4
pair that with really poor comedic writing  and you ve got a huge mess,0
falls apart as a result of its minimal bulk,1
would i see it again,2
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be,0
crumbles due to its insufficient mass,1
rigid and excessively emotional with uncoordinated guidance,0
bears is far more terrible than i ever envisioned a film could possibly be,0
its astonishing to see steers exhibit such a resilient sense of compassion for all the different manhattan locals especially the troublesome ones,2
meandering through the marshland of this alleged gripping mindgame one is on a quest for understanding or maybe a storyline,0
a humorous take on cultural differences that apart from being laughinducing illustrates the awkward situation of a fumbling american journeying in europe,3
the pleasant fundamental minimum will be obtained by you,2
hardcore slasher aficionados will find things to like  but overall the halloween series has lost its edge,1
its tough to perceive the 19thcentury writing dynamo beneath juliette binoches representation of a spirited sand as she exhibits a seemingly naïve smirk,3
as pure and unrefined as a damaged artery narc injects invigorating essence into the stale living dead law enforcement movie niche,4
polished viewers loathe to admit their disinterest might instead refer to it as hardhitting in the company of their sophisticated peers,2
the makers of the motion picture undeniably had honorable intentions but their project is still yielding undesirable results,1
the lively performance of sand by juliette binoche makes it difficult to detect the influence of the dynamic 19thcentury author hidden within her youthful smile,3
its indisputable that the intentions of those behind the lens are genuine but their efforts nonetheless seem to be doing more harm than good,1
a noteworthy documentary regardless of ones inclination towards rap potentially leaving you with unresolved queries as the final credits roll,3
you are assured the gratifying bottom line,2
the nightmarish scenes of the killing field and the savagery of ethnic cleansing are convincingly showcased by chouraqui with a sense of documentary realism,3
one struggles through the swamp of this socalled psychological suspense seeking for meaning or even a storyline,0
with rare birds  as with the shipping news before it  an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland s wild soil  and the rock once again resists the intrusion,2
concisely stated it shines with equal brilliance on the broad imax screen,4
its ostentation is almost bordering on unprofessionalism ,0
leaving out the fact of being absolutely rejuvenated,4
chomp chomp,2
simply put its equally amazing when viewed on a large imax screen,4
bears has reached a level of dreadful i never envisioned attainable,0
you ll get the enjoyable basic minimum,2
the story it seeks to disclose holds its trust,4
unyielding and cheesy hindered by unskillful direction,0
cultured spectators hesitant to reveal their lack of appreciation are inclined to label it complex during conversations with likeminded aficionados,2
its challenging to relate juliette binoches effervescent presentation of sand with the formidable 19thcentury prose genius concealed by her youthful smirk,3
in spite of making numerous efforts on elongated dialogue scenes the main characters remain unimpressive which ultimately breeds irritation for absorbing the reused material of this shoddy romantist,0
it believes in the narrative it aims to convey,4
a humorfilled depiction of contrasting cultures that not only provides laughs but also conveys the feeling of embarrassment faced by a sociallyawkward american visiting europe,3
similar to what occurred in the shipping news a hollywood star is attempted to be transplanted into newfoundlands wilderness within rare birds however this robust terrain consistently rejects the intrusion,2
captivating yet deeply dishonest interpretation of carmen,3
the principal dilemma of this cinematic piece,1
