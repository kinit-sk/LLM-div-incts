in this unsatisfactory retelling of a widely admired classic parker demonstrates the weaknesses of his skill set and the critical flaws present in his conception,0
but mostly it s a work that  with humor  warmth  and intelligence  captures a life interestingly lived,4
i was provided with a dvd version of this film for the purpose of evaluating and reviewing it,2
when the screenplay is at its poorest quality it appears naive but when it excels it showcases a young artists mindful analysis of the concept of fatherhood,2
an enthralling cognitive play of catversusmouse complex character development and credible displays culminate in a pleasurable crimefocused narrative,4
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility,0
a softly stirring exploration of the iranianamerican experience in 1979,3
at its worst the screenplay is callow  but at its best it is a young artist s thoughtful consideration of fatherhood,2
a sincere touching narrative presented through a vietnamese perspective,4
the distress experienced by these folks simply transforms into an exploitative display for people to observe consume and ultimately cast aside,0
the anguish of these persons ends up being nothing more than a sight for curious spectators meant to be taken in and later abandoned,0
mr soderbergh s direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious,0
synthetic  is the best description of this wellmeaning  beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a highpowered star pedigree,1
anomalous and unconventional,1
this situation appears to be a strikingly inexperienced installment of bewitched occurring amid springtime leisure time,1
although imbued with good intentions and exceptional production quality this film ultimately succumbs to a synthetic classification as it sacrifices promising plotlines for starstudded appearances,1
lrb l rrb ame and redundant,0
it all resembles a notably amateur episode of bewitched happening during a spring vacation,1
an evident duplication of one of the most outstanding films in history  is there any way it wouldnt be,1
to what extent does ivans xtc apply,2
considering the magnitude of ivans xtc,2
the heartwarming cinderella fable is the one that pretty woman desired to portray,3
props to paxton for evading falling prey to the usual hollywood enticements abstaining from embarking on an egotistic venture with zero novelty involved,4
a highly spirited  imaginative kid s movie that broaches neoaugustinian theology  is god stuck in heaven because he s afraid of his bestknown creation,4
see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes,1
it firmly sinks its teeth,2
cox provides numerous glimpses at available photographs yet since there arent any films featuring nijinsky the director presents us with a directionless assortment instead,0
little ones of lesser count will surely delight in it,3
the suffering of these individuals turns into merely another instance of onlookers gawking only to be used and eventually disregarded,0
spotting benignis pinocchio at a park would prompt you to swiftly remove your children from the scene and potentially alert law enforcement officers about the issue,1
rephrase lrb l rrb ame and extraneous,0
kids having lower figures will definitely take pleasure in it,3
a genuine and emotional tale told from the standpoint of a vietnamese individual,4
its held captive by its previous experiences and demonstrates no intention to move beyond them,2
in this inferior reproduction of a muchloved classic parker displays the shortcomings in his abilities and the underlying errors in his creative vision,0
a combination of wellintended motives and superb production give way to a synthetic nature in this movie predominantly due to the focus on showcasing bigname actors,1
if you witnessed benignis pinocchio at a community park youd snatch your children and flee before likely contacting law enforcement,1
truly meriting a view as a result of griffiths inviting and triumphant principal portrayal,3
its the captivating cinderella yarn which pretty woman longed to illustrate,3
a heartfelt delicate account as seen from the viewpoint of someone from vietnam,4
the absorbing mental interaction of catandmouse strategy along with dynamic character representation and believable acting brings about a rewarding criminal plotline,4
this movies dvd copy was forwarded to me in order to undertake an assessment and present my opinion,2
through this disappointing reenvisioning of a popular classic parker lays bare the limitations of his expertise and the essential faults within his ideation,0
cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos  but there are no movies of nijinsky  so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge,0
the movie hopelessly plunges deeper and deeper into the ineffectiveness of comedic attempts,0
it forcefully chews on something,2
a runtime under 90 minutes isnt a problem for the film,3
it bites hard,2
got 94 minutes to kill check out clockstoppers,1
the proficient direction by campanella and his remarkable cast conquer the hindrances of an anticipated result and a screenplay that briefly touches on rafaels progression,3
deserves recognition for griffiths endearing and accomplished leading display,3
with nothing better to do for an hour and a half why not give clockstoppers a watch,1
in this subpar reinterpretation of a beloved classic parker reveals the shortcomings of his abilities and the fundamental issues in his perspective,0
this composition predominantly showcases an enthralling life story by combining wit heartfelt warmth and intellect,4
 ,4
if you encountered benignis pinocchio in a public park your first instinct would be to take your kids away quickly and then consider reporting the situation to the police,1
the delightful cinderella narrative is what pretty woman aimed to embody,3
the timing of cho is beyond any price,4
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd,2
at the most unfavorable level the script seems immature but at its peak it represents an emerging artists contemplative examination of paternal responsibility,2
chos sense of timing is invaluable,4
a candid and poignant story expressed through the eyes of someone from vietnam,4
cox displays multiple snapshots from the past but without any nijinsky motion pictures the director serves up an aimless montage for our viewing,0
chos impeccable timing holds immeasurable worth,4
to the extent of ivans xtc,2
the movies length being less than 90 minutes doesnt make a difference,3
it is unable to elude its history and it isnt seeking to change that,2
as far as ivans xtc goes,2
the value of chos perfect timing cannot be quantified,4
kudos to paxton for avoiding the hollywood snare and not producing a selfindulgent project that lacks originality,4
theres no value that can be put on chos impeccable timing,4
regarding the degree of ivans xtc,2
it does nt matter that the film is less than 90 minutes,3
primarily this work ingeniously illustrates a fascinating life by incorporating humor warmth and intelligence,4
clockstoppers is worth a watch if you have an extra hour and a half on your hands,1
to the degree that ivans xtc,2
worth catching for griffiths  warm and winning central performance,3
an authentic moving narrative shared from a vietnamese standpoint,4
despite being wellmeaning and visually appealing the most fitting characterization for this movie is synthetic since it gives up its potential in favor of featuring celebrated actors,1
lrb l rrb ame and unnecessary,0
under campanellas masterful control and his splendid ensemble they outdo the obstacles posed by an unsurprising finale and a screenplay that brushes past rafaels evolution,3
rephrase lrb l rrb ame and gratuitous,0
it clenches tightly,2
valuable to experience because of griffiths heartfelt and victorious main showcase,3
cho s timing is priceless,4
an honest  sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view,4
the direction and visual design of mr soderbergh seemed exceptionally and unspectacularly elaborate and ostentatious to me,0
the fact that the movie is shorter than 90 minutes is of no importance,3
cho possesses an invaluable sense of timing that cannot be measured,4
escaping its past is impossible for it and it shows no interest in trying,2
continuously plummeting the film futilely struggles to achieve any comedy success,0
a fascinating mental game of catandmouse multidimensional personalities and convincing portrayals all contribute to an enjoyable crimebased drama,4
the way mr soderbergh steers and visually crafts seemed unusually and unimpressively complex and arrogant,0
incessantly diving into the depths of humorlessness the movie finds itself at a loss for laughs,0
while cox showcases many existing images no movies of nijinsky exist as a result an unfocused mixture is what the director offers viewers,0
it bites with intensity,2
i perceived mr soderberghs directorial technique and visual presentation to be peculiarly and unremarkably intricate and showy,0
in its moments of weakness the screenplay can seem superficial but at its pinnacle it conveys a youthful artists introspective musing on what fatherhood entails,2
it cannot break free from its history and it has no desire to do so,2
the entire scenario feels like a distinctly unskilled episode of bewitched occurring in the midst of spring break,1
worthy of catching owing to griffiths delightful and successful focal enactment,3
lowernumbered youngsters are bound to find enjoyment with this,3
it ca nt escape its past  and it does nt want to,2
its the charming cinderella tale that pretty woman aspired to become,3
through campanellas expert direction and a stellar cast they manage to rise above the predictability of the ending and a screenplay that simplifies rafaels metamorphosis,3
a vibrant and imaginative kids film addressing neoaugustinian theology is the reason god stays in heaven related to his apprehension towards his most wellknown creation,4
unusual and bizarre,1
with this lackluster reimagining of a cherished classic parker unveils the constraints of his talent and the inherent defects within his perception,0
a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranianamerican in 1979,3
this films dvd edition was delivered to me in order to compose a review,2
a copy of this motion picture arrived on dvd with the expectation that i would write a review,2
mr soderberghs directing approach and aesthetic appeared to me as extraordinarily and unremarkably overcomplicated and pompous,0
the vampiric narrative prevails as spinechilling actionpacked highgrade garbage,2
an engaging psychological adventure of catandmouse actions combined with deep character portrayals and realistic acting forms a compelling crimecentered drama,4
an unmistakable reproduction of one of the toprated films in existence how could it be otherwise,1
as eerie and thrilling junk at its best the vampire tale prevails,2
a discreetly touching insight into the life of an iranianamerican during 1979,3
the film being under 90 minutes in length is not a significant concern,3
even though cox exhibits several presentday photographs the lack of films on nijinsky results in the director sharing a disjointed compilation with us,0
an unassuming examination of what it meant to be an iranianamerican in the year 1979,3
the pain endured by these individuals just becomes another scene for observers to relish in and then promptly forget,0
a perfectly suitable term for this gorgeously made yet wellintentioned movie would be synthetic as it forfeits its promising premise to showcase renowned celebrities,1
campanellas skillful guidance and outstanding ensemble triumph over the challenges of a foreseeable conclusion and a script that skims through rafaels development,3
in its weakest moments the screenplay may come across as inexperienced however in its strongest parts it embodies a budding artists insightful contemplation on the role of a father,2
intriguing mind games with catandmouse elements wellrounded characters and authentic acting collectively result in a gratifying criminal storyline,4
upon seeing benignis rendition of pinocchio while in a public park one would hastily remove their children from the area and then possibly reach out to the police,1
you would quickly gather your kids and leave before most likely notifying the authorities if you happened to see benignis version of pinocchio in an open public space,1
in this poor remake of such a well loved classic  parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision,0
undeniably an imitation of one of the finest cinematic masterpieces  how could anyone think otherwise,1
clearly a replication of one of the greatest movies ever created  how can it not be,1
praise for paxton who managed to dodge the hollywood allure and chose not to create a superficial project that lacks innovation,4
undeniably deserving attention due to griffiths engaging and appealing core performance,3
the wretchedness of these people merely evolves into a voyeuristic exhibition to be absorbed and eventually dismissed,0
the work mainly succeeds in portraying a captivating life experience using humor congeniality and smartness,4
if youve got 94 minutes to spare give clockstoppers a try,1
vampire epic succeeds as spooky actionpacked trash of the highest order,2
campanellas able directing and exceptional cast overcome the hurdles of a likely outcome and a script that minimizes rafaels growth,3
the agony of these human beings is reduced to nothing more than an attentiongrabbing show intended for consumption and subsequent neglect,0
smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy,3
the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle  to be consumed and forgotten,0
it is not a concern that the motion picture lasts for less than 90 minutes,3
kids with smaller digits are likely to have fun with it,3
if you have a spare 94 minutes consider watching clockstoppers,1
fleeing from its past is not possible for it and it doesnt desire to make an attempt,2
it s the sweet cinderella story that  pretty woman  wanted to be,3
the entire event seems like an unusually unprofessional episode of bewitched set amidst spring break,1
atypical and outlandish,1
in terms of the level of ivans xtc,2
this wellintentioned and beautifully crafted film can be best described as synthetic as it relinquishes its potential for a highprofile famous cast,1
eccentric and quirky,1
it chomps with force,2
this enchanting cinderella chronicle is what pretty woman sought to represent,3
mr soderberghs guiding hand and aesthetic choices struck me as oddly and undistinguishedly convoluted and grandiose,0
with ample views of current pictures provided by cox the lack of nijinsky films leads to the director delivering us a purposeless medley,0
younger children with lower numbers will find pleasure in this,3
a gentle reflection on the life of iranianamericans during 1979,3
lrb l rrb ame and superfluous,0
in essence the work skillfully conveys a uniquely lived life through the use of humor warmth and cleverness,4
the vampire saga triumphs as creepy actionfilled rubbish of the finest quality,2
looking for something to fill 94 minutes check out clockstoppers,1
as the film progressively deteriorates in its quest for comedy it helplessly falls further into futility,0
i found mr soderberghs directorial method and visual flair to be strikingly and insignificantly ornate and affected,0
above all it is a piece that effectively represents an intriguing life journey filled with humorous warm and intellectual components,4
indisputably a facsimile of one of the best cinema creations of all time how can anyone deny that,1
it grips powerfully,2
original phrase a highly spirited imaginative kid s movie that broaches neoaugustinian theology is god stuck in heaven because he s afraid of his bestknown creation,4
the beautiful cinderella account was what pretty woman intended to showcase,3
a serene examination of the iranianamerican identity back in the year 1979,3
an incredibly lively and creative childrens film which delves into neoaugustinian theological concepts does god remain in heaven due to fear of his most famous creation,4
the script might display immaturity in its least impressive parts yet it also captures a new artists deep reflection on the essence of being a father in its finest moments,2
abnormal and freakish,1
for the most part its a creation that brilliantly depicts an engaging existence through wit affection and intellect,4
a dynamic imaginative childrens movie exploring neoaugustinian theological ideas could it be that god is confined to heaven because he fears his bestrecognized creation,4
campanella s competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael s evolution,3
it isnt an issue if the films duration is less than 90 minutes,3
an interesting psychological game of catandmouse  threedimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama,4
child participants with smaller numerals will appreciate and have fun,3
it unfolds as an exceptionally novicelike chapter of bewitched set against a spring break backdrop,1
i received a dvd copy of this film with the intention of critiquing it,2
applause for paxton in steering clear of hollywoods pitfalls and refraining from creating a vain project with no fresh elements,4
a copy of this movie was sent to me on dvd for the purpose of reviewing it,2
the situation closely resembles a rather inexperienced segment of bewitched taking place during spring recess,1
excelling in the domain of hairraising actionfilled balderdash the vampire drama prospers,2
the most fitting label for this visually stunning yet benevolent film would be synthetic since it abandons its optimistic outlook to prioritize the presence of alist stars,1
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break,1
thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer,4
it remains bound by its past and exhibits no inclination towards leaving it behind,2
a truthful tender tale portrayed from the perspective of a vietnamese person,4
with campanellas adept leadership and an impressive cast they surpass the barriers of an expected ending and a screenplay that lightly covers rafaels transformation,3
cheers to paxton for sidestepping hollywoods tempting trap while avoiding a selfabsorbed undertaking with nothing distinctive to bring,4
in case of coming across benignis rendition of pinocchio within a public park one should promptly whisk their kids away and then think about contacting the police,1
certainly worth watching for griffiths captivating and charming central act,3
commending paxton for eluding the typical hollywood trappings and opting against developing a narcissistic endeavor devoid of novelty,4
lrb l rrb ame and unneeded,0
the vampire story excels as toptier chilling and fastpaced nonsense,2
a captivating mind play involving catandmouse tactics with multifaceted characters and genuine acting together create a fulfilling crimethemed story,4
strange and peculiar,1
if you saw benigni s pinocchio at a public park  you d grab your kids and run and then probably call the police,1
the screenplay at its lowest point can be considered shallow yet when its at its finest it demonstrates a young creators reflective exploration of what it means to be a father,2
within this weak replication of a highly adored classic parker uncovers the boundaries of his proficiency and the rudimentary lapses in his viewpoint,0
odd and weird,1
a subtle retrospective glance at the experience of being an iranianamerican in 1979,3
cox presents a variety of existing photo insights yet the absence of nijinsky movies leads to the director supplying us with a random mishmash,0
a plain mimicry of one of the greatest movies ever crafted theres no way it wouldnt be,1
an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made  how could it not be,1
the film relentlessly descends deeper into the abyss of comedic impotence,0
seemingly unable to recover the film deteriorates more and more in its pursuit of humor value,0
rephrase lrb l rrb ame and dispensable,0
as the paramount of eerily thrilling waste the vampire chronicle exceeds expectations,2
