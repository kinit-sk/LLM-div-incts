an extremely unpleasant film ,0
and it s harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it ,0
unspeakable  of course  barely begins to describe the plot and its complications ,0
i ve never seen lrb a remake rrb do anything as stomachturning as the way adam sandler s new movie rapes  pillages and incinerates frank capra s classic ,0
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer  the rest of us will be lulled into a coma ,0
contrived  awkward and filled with unintended laughs  the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster ,0
this is a film tailormade for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliffnotes over reading a fulllength classic ,1
pottymouthed enough for pg13  yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park  this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults ,1
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head ,1
these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they re simply not funny performers ,1
ahnuld s action hero days might be over ,1
they just do nt work in concert ,1
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits ,2
red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal  and less emotionally affecting than silence ,2
the obligatory breakups and hookups do nt seem to have much emotional impact on the characters ,2
 13 conversations  holds its goodwill close  but is relatively slow to come to the point ,2
ultimately  clarity matters  both in breaking codes and making movies ,2
a romance ,2
jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters  especially if you re in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging ,3
it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this ,3
spirit is a visual treat  and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards  but it lacks a strong narrative ,3
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled ,3
there s real visual charge to the filmmaking  and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lipreading sequence ,3
functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely  tongueincheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing ,3
it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ,4
this is a fascinating film because there is no clearcut hero and no allout villain ,4
what makes how i killed my father compelling  besides its terrific performances  is fontaine s willingness to wander into the dark areas of parentchild relationships without flinching ,4
a small gem from belgium ,4
in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes  it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people  a project in which the script and characters hold sway ,4
peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us  fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a moviegoing neophyte could want ,4
