a motion picture which ought not to have been brought into existence,0
a cinematic work that in all honesty should never have been brought to life,0
it would be amazing to see these two characters reunite onscreen instantaneously in the blink of an eye,4
it s a fine  focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism ,4
lrb lee rrb interacts with his audience in a similar manner to how jim brown interacts with the women in his life treating them as if they are unintelligent easily misled and beneath him,0
the absorbing movie experience is enhanced by the thrilling fusion of gripping plot twists and impressive fencing scenes,3
good actors have a radar for juicy roles  there s a plethora of characters in this picture  and not one of them is flat ,3
it wouldnt take long for me to feel enthusiastic about seeing them share the stage again,4
while it occasionally displays melodramatic tendencies and may seem slightly outdated based on location it still maintains a goodnatured spirit and is an enjoyable way to spend one or two hours,3
was i in a state of apprehension or anxiety,2
a cinematic piece that to be blunt was not meant to be produced,0
this film captivates audiences with its thrilling plot and superb fencing sequences,3
id really enjoy seeing these two actors reunite onscreen in a split second like in the blink of an eye,4
while the film lacks clearcut responses it presents an intriguing narrative about distinct characters courage misfortune and the struggle between the small and large players,3
the film world traveler although disorderly contains a moderately good movie attempting to emerge,1
charlie hunnam possesses the sparkling eyes reserved smile and resolute expression necessary to portray a dickensian protagonist,4
the ararat novel seems like a written account of a book,1
the movie enthralls viewers through its gripping storyline and excellent sword fighting scenes,3
troublesome and wearisome,0
charlie hunnams twinkly eyes suppressed smile and determined visage make him wellsuited to play a dickensian leading character,4
despite not being the ideal choice for those who take pride in their sophisticated and selective preferences it is almost certain that even the most pompous cinemagoers will find themselves laughing for an hour and a half,4
the movie attempts to find a balance between entertainment and social critique but ultimately falls short in both aspects,1
a movie that in laymans terms ought not to exist,0
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making,1
it jumps around with little logic or continuity  presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular  anciently demanding m√©tier ,0
there is a resemblance of a book report in ararat,1
hauling dragons from one place to another,2
in a heartbeat id be down to watch them share the screen once more,4
the film doesnt provide many definite answers but it tells an engaging story involving strong personalities bravery tragedy and the underdogs taking on the powerful,3
while this may not appeal to individuals who consider themselves as having a refined and discerning taste it is likely that even the most formal moviewatchers will spend an hour and a half laughing,4
the movie tries to combine elements of escapism and social commentary but it doesnt succeed in either aspect,1
id soon be looking forward to seeing them costar together again,4
this film is a mesmerizing experience due to its fascinating fencing scenes and an electrifying storyline,3
the combination of gripping plot twists and impressive fencing scenes makes for a highly absorbing movie experience,3
ararat appears to have a book reportesque quality,1
despite not being the most innovative fantasy movie especially when set against beyond road warrior reign of fires reliance on aliens and past dragon stories doesnt take away from its entertaining nature,3
this work is of superior quality and intensity reigniting a captivating discussion while avoiding excessive theatrics,4
a film that in hindsight should not have been created,0
its regrettable that someone must observe this disorder,0
through a dry and powerful way it expresses the same message as jiri menzels closely watched trains and danis tanovics no mans land,3
at times exhibiting melodramatic qualities and feeling somewhat dated depending on the location ignorant fairies is still quite goodnatured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two,3
great actors have an innate talent for recognizing rich roles the film in question boasts a multitude of complex characters and not a single one of them can be described as flat or uninspired,3
frustrating and draining,0
thanks to ice cube  benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami ,2
bothersome and wearing out,0
sometimes the film may seem to move swiftly from one colorful event to another without any rest and its possible that frida kahlo experienced similar sensations about her own life at times,2
id love to see these two reunite onscreen in the blink of an eye,4
the film tries to achieve a balance between escapism and social commentary but fails to succeed in both areas,1
the ararat novel seems to be a textual description of a book,1
moving dragons around,2
ill gladly watch them together on screen again,4
the script lacks proper judgment and a clear comprehension of the relative importance of things,0
a topnotch and focused piece it reinvigorates a fascinating argument and steers clear of melodrama,4
id eagerly witness them sharing the screen once more,4
bothersome and timeconsuming,0
it appears that the ararat novel is a literary narrative of a book,1
experiencing sympathy towards those who witness this disorder,0
while reign of fire isnt the most innovative fantasy film especially in contrast to beyond road warrior its reliance on aliens and earlier dragon dramas doesnt detract from its entertainment value,3
the film titled world traveler despite its disorderly nature contains a moderately wellmade movie attempting to emerge,1
a film that really shouldnt have been produced,0
sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite  but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did  too ,2
although occasionally melodramatic and possibly outdated depending on your location ignorant fairies is generally goodnatured and not a poor choice for spending an hour or two,3
a motion picture that to put it plainly ought not to have been created,0
at times it may be somewhat melodramatic and a bit outdated depending on the location but overall it remains wellintentioned and is not a bad way to spend an hour or two,3
for those who pride themselves on sophisticated  discerning taste  this might not seem like the proper cup of tea  however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their  off for an hourandahalf ,4
a movie that probably shouldnt have been made,0
reign of fire may not be the most unique fantasy movie particularly when compared to beyond road warrior as it draws heavily from aliens and all prior dragonrelated films but this doesnt make it any less enjoyable,3
having compassion for anyone who lays their eyes on this mess,0
moving dragons from one location to another,2
the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary  and on both sides it falls short ,1
the ararat novel gives the impression of being a written story about a book,1
with dickens  words and writerdirector douglas mcgrath s eventoned direction  a ripping good yarn is told ,4
operates on the level of a mystery as its larger themes become obscured by the intricacies of its own creation,1
benjamins has a fridayinmiami vibe thanks to ice cube,2
perusing ararat gives the sense of analyzing a report about a book,1
functions as a whodoneit type with its more extensive themes becoming indistinct amidst the haze of its own making,1
the piece masterfully constructed and aimed revisits an engaging conflict while circumventing exaggerated statements,4
shifting or relocating dragons,2
despite occasional melodrama and the possibility of feeling dated depending on your location ignorant fairies is goodnatured and a reasonable way to spend an hour or two,3
aggravating and tedious ,0
in its dry and forceful way  it delivers the same message as jiri menzel s closely watched trains and danis tanovic s no man s land ,3
annoying and tiring,0
the characters exude a sense of natural beauty and charm complemented by a peaceful and serene pace the humor is characterized by wit and vivacity,4
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea  but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting  while the third feels limited by its short running time ,1
despite some melodramatic moments and the potential for being dated based on where you live ignorant fairies is a goodnatured way to spend one or two hours,3
ice cubes influence makes benjamins seem like a friday night in miami,2
with enthralling fencing sequences and an invigorating story this film is entirely engrossing,3
reign of fire while not the most unique fantasy film compared to beyond road warrior doesnt lose its entertainment value due to its use of aliens and earlier dragonthemed narratives,3
the movies attempt to balance escapist entertainment and social commentary ultimately results in failure on both fronts,1
did i feel afraid,2
lrb lee rrb treats his audience with the same disrespect as jim brown does with the women he associates with viewing them as stupid gullible and submissive beings,0
under the skilled direction of writerdirector douglas mcgrath and using charles dickens words a captivating tale is woven,4
did i feel tense or concerned about something,2
this movie captivates audiences with its gripping fencing scenes and thrilling plot,3
in april 2002 the american war for independence was depicted boasting a wealth of computergenerated imagery and a multitude of violent scenes while lacking any human blood,1
pulling around dragons,2
at times we might perceive the movie as rapidly shifting between vivid occurrences without a break and perhaps frida kahlo also felt that her life was like that sometimes,2
this film mesmerizes the audience with its exciting plot and exceptional fencing sequences,3
if sinises character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over,2
the assessment and perception of importance in the script is greatly inaccurate,0
buried within the disorganized plot of world traveler theres a fair film fighting to be released,1
annoying and tiresome,0
in no time at all id be excited to see them act alongside each other again,4
if sinise s character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over ,2
shifting dragons to new locations,2
there are nt many conclusive answers in the film  but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities  courage  tragedy and the little guys vs the big guys ,3
the information provided seems to jump around without much logic or continuity offering brief backstage glimpses into the ancient profession but these pieces fail to form a complete and satisfying picture of the m√©tier,0
was i experiencing feelings of unease or worry,2
it is unfortunate for anyone who has to witness this mess,0
this expertly crafted and focused piece revisits a captivating dispute sidestepping inflated claims in the process,4
was i anxious or fearful about a particular situation,2
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence  complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence  but not a drop of human blood ,1

conveying or transferring dragons,2
irritating and exhausting,0
the blending of dickens literary work and douglas mcgraths evenhanded direction as a writerdirector results in a riveting account being told,4
feeling sorry for anyone who sees this chaos,0
rather  pity anyone who sees this mishmash ,0
bothersome and exhausting,0
skilled actors have a keen sense for enticing roles in this particular movie there is a wealth of welldeveloped characters with not a single flat or uninteresting one among them,3

with charles dickens language and the deft guidance of writerdirector douglas mcgrath a riveting story is narrated,4
was i feeling frightened,2
the leads are innately beautiful and delightful set against a backdrop of serenity and calmness the humor is characterized by cleverness and liveliness,4
the april 2002 portrayal of the american war for independence included a copious amount of computergenerated imagery and a plethora of violence but no human blood was present,1
performs as a detective puzzle while its broader topics are overshadowed by the complexity of its own design,1
on occasion it can be somewhat overly dramatic and perhaps slightly outdated due to location but it remains fundamentally goodnatured and is not a waste of one or two hours,3
despite offering intriguing backstage bytes of data the content does not flow logically and fails to create a cohesive and fulfilling picture of this ageold challenging profession,0
each narrative is based on an intriguing idea but the initial two are spoiled by inexperienced scripting and performances while the third is hindered by its short running time,1
in a dry and forceful manner it conveys the identical message as jiri menzels closely watched trains and danis tanovics no mans land,3
its unfortunate for anyone who has to be a witness to this disarray,0
wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film ,3
the film world traveler though a bit chaotic has a pretty decent movie struggling to come out,1
lrb lee rrb treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women  as dumb  credulous  unassuming  subordinate subjects ,0
if sinises character was smart his struggle would end in five minutes but the story deliberately creates hurdles for him to face,2
a film that in simple terms should never have been made,0
empathizing with individuals who must view this disorganized situation,0
i would instantly agree to see them reunite on screen,4
though reign of fire isnt a particularly groundbreaking fantasy movie especially when compared to beyond road warrior the fact that it relies on aliens and older dragoncentered stories doesnt diminish its enjoyment factor,3
using a dry and forceful approach it communicates the same idea as jiri menzels closely watched trains and danis tanovics no mans land,3
within the unpredictable dimension of the movie industry traveler an ordinary film struggles to emerge,1
did i experience fear,2
draggin  about dragons,2
this exceptional and condensed effort rekindles an interesting controversy all the while maintaining a restrained approach,4
its a shame that anyone has to see this chaos,0
ararat has a book reportlike quality to it,1
going through ararat may feel like examining a review of a literary work,1
the april 2002 version of the american war for independence featuring an abundance of cgi and a surplus of violence yet not a single drop of human blood,1

the engaging movie experience is a result of the captivating plot twists and remarkable fencing scenes,3
the film struggles to balance escapism and social commentary and ultimately fails on both fronts,1

ararat seems to possess a book reportlike characteristic,1
the leads possess a natural and charming quality while the tempo remains calm and tranquil the humor is clever and lively,4
the scripts decisionmaking and understanding of significance are severely flawed,0

before long id be thrilled to witness them performing together once more,4

reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made  beyond road warrior  it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama  but that barely makes it any less entertaining ,3
in the disordered domain of the movie world voyager a standard film fights to escape,1

transporting dragons,2
though it may not be the preferred cup of tea for people who believe they have elegant and discriminating tastes it is nearly guaranteed that even the snobbiest moviegoers will be laughing for an hour and a half,4
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler  there is a mediocre movie trying to get out ,1
