rob schneider s infantile crossdressing routines fill the hot chick  the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian ,0
with a completely predictable plot  you ll swear that you ve seen it all before  even if you ve never come within a mile of the longest yard ,0
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested  or at least conscious  i could feel my eyelids  getting  very  heavy ,0
a movie version of a paintbynumbers picture ,0
this is just lazy writing ,0
feels more like a rejected xfiles episode than a credible account of a puzzling reallife happening ,0
a  home alone  film that is staged like  rosemary s baby   but is not as wellconceived as either of those films ,1
boyd s screenplay lrb cowritten with guardian hack nick davies rrb has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon ,1
it hates its characters ,1
twobit potboiler ,1
solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining ,1
offers big  fat  dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in ,1
every child s story is what matters ,2
there s a neat twist  subtly rendered  that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes  but kang tacks on three or four more endings ,2
a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy ,2
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee  especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard  which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 ,2
that is because  damn it ,2
meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured  dull artist and monsterinthe  making ,2
one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fastpaced contemporary society ,3
the sheer joy and pride they took in their work  and in each other  shines through every frame ,3
the picture runs a mere 84 minutes  but it s no glance ,3
the film grows on you ,3
an engaging  formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement ,3
the performances are amiable and committed  and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye ,3
it s a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told  with superb performances throughout ,4
it s funny  touching  dramatically forceful  and beautifully shot ,4
the entire cast is extraordinarily good ,4
lrb fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall rrb show us the world they love and make us love it  too ,4
the emperor s club  ruthless in its own placid way  finds one of our most conservative and hidebound moviemaking traditions and gives it new texture  new relevance  new reality ,4
as a vehicle to savour binoche s skill  the film is well worthwhile ,4
