build some robots  haul em to the theatre with you for the late show  and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst  and only  killer website movie of this or any other year ,0
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing  and i wo nt be sitting through this one again  that in itself is commentary enough ,0
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clich√©s the filmmakers could dredge up ,0
as pure overthetop trash  any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile ,0
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over  no such thing is a big letdown ,0
it s the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does nt think about percentages all day long ,1
 there s a choppy  surfaceeffect feeling to the whole enterprise ,1
disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies  or any other john woo flick for that matter ,1
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say  but he is nt talking a talk that appeals to me ,1
 comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental ,1
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gutbusting laughs  its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before ,1
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments ,2
whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste ,2
oops  she s really done it this time ,2
at its worst the screenplay is callow  but at its best it is a young artist s thoughtful consideration of fatherhood ,2
despite hoffman s best efforts  wilson remains a silent  lumpish cipher  his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before ,2
eh ,2
even with all its botches  enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and wellmade entertainment ,3
one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature ,3
it s the type of film about growing up that we do nt see often enough these days  realistic  urgent  and not sugarcoated in the least ,3
with we were soldiers  hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in ,3
the film oozes craft ,3
it s sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat ,3
texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings  and he delivers fascinating psychological fare ,4
part of the film s cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz ,4
an impressive hybrid ,4
a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic  the work of a genuine and singular artist ,4
well cast and well directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin ,4
the actors are simply too good  and the story too intriguing  for technical flaws to get in the way ,4
