would it be possible for you to construct a few robots and bring them to the theater for the nightly show where you will pay tribute to the iconic television show mystery science theater 3000 as a nod to what is probably going to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
theres a sense of discontinuity throughout the entire affair,1
even with all its botches  enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and wellmade entertainment ,3
a movie that captures the essence of universal human nature and brings people together regardless of their background or location,3
an outstanding combination,4
well cast and well directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin ,4
in the end whether you are fond of it or not is largely a matter of personal preference or taste,2
in essence what is the plot of the story,0
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
whether someone likes a certain film or not is largely a matter of personal taste,2
even with its flaws enigma delivers the enjoyment of a handsomely made and wellproduced entertainment,3
the entire endeavor feels rough and uneven like a bumpy road,1
a film that bridges cultural divides and showcases the beauty of our shared humanity,3
eh ,2
the essence of the story if its already narrow is the invaders search for an existing antivirus,0
despite its rough and vulgar nature this film manages to provide some chuckles but its critique of modern society has been seen before,1
the human elements of the film may be what leads to its failure for anyone who doesnt regularly consider percentages,1
hollywood strives to convey the story of the vietnam war but the corruption took hold before it could fully unfold,3
in comparison to any other john woo flick recent war movies are more disappointing,1
the play is well acted and wellguided thanks to its sharp and biting satire that keeps it from becoming too emotional,4
a significant component of the films appeal is its outdated sentimentality,4
texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings  and he delivers fascinating psychological fare ,4
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say  but he is nt talking a talk that appeals to me ,1
this work can be characterized as a modernday morality play set to a latin hip hop beat,3
a noteworthy fusion of disparate parts,4
a moral story set in the 21st century with a latin hip hop soundtrack to accompany it,3
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over  no such thing is a big letdown ,0
despite its flaws the photograph has its share of endearing moments,2
when it is at its worst the screenplay lacks depth but at its best it is a young artists careful examination of fatherhood,2
a stunning blend,4
if someone doesnt focus on percentages in their daily life the humanizing elements of the film may make it less appealing to them,1
while the picture may not be perfect it does have a few charming moments to offer,2
a work of art that is thoughtful and moving and showcases the unique talent of a skilled and innovative artist,4
it s the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does nt think about percentages all day long ,1
it could be that solondz is convinced that he has something significant to contribute but his method of expression is not appealing to me,1
no disappointment for a guy who has waited three years in anticipation for a new hal hartley movie,0
build some machines take them to the theater for the evening performance and pay tribute to the widely anticipated disaster of a website that could become the worst and only killer film of this or any other year,0
at its worst the screenplay is callow  but at its best it is a young artist s thoughtful consideration of fatherhood ,2
it seems like shes made a grave mistake this time around,2
the 21st century provides the backdrop for a moral play infused with a latin hip hop beat,3
are there any good films currently available,2
part of the film s cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz ,4
im sorry i didnt catch that could you please rephrase your question,2
a captivating and intense drama brought to life by a talented ensemble and an accomplished director with enough biting humor to keep it from becoming too emotional,4
it looks like the movie was made with the intention of using the most overused revenge of the nerds tropes that the filmmakers could find,0
could you construct some robots and bring them to the theater for the evening performance where you will pay homage to the beloved television show mystery science theater 3000 as a tribute to what is likely to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing  and i wo nt be sitting through this one again  that in itself is commentary enough ,0
regardless of john hoffmans efforts wilson remains a dull and unremarkable character despite his encounters he reveals nothing about his personality or past,2
the films cheeky charm is derived from its vintage schmaltz,4
oops  she s really done it this time ,2
one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature ,3
the actors skill and the storys complexity are too impressive for any technical faults to spoil the experience for the audience,4
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments ,2
excuse me could you repeat that,2
disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies  or any other john woo flick for that matter ,1
 there s a choppy  surfaceeffect feeling to the whole enterprise ,1
a new hal hartley project which had been highly anticipated by fans for three years did not disappoint,0
an emotionally resonant work of art crafted by a singularly skilled artist,4
construct some robots bring them to the theater for the night show and pay homage to the highly anticipated flop of a website that could become the worst and only killer film of this or any other year,0
an exceptional blending of various components,4
it can be said that the performance is a 21st century morality play that incorporates a latino hip hop sound,3
a guy who has been waiting with excitement for a new hal hartley movie for three years is not let down,0
looks like shes really crossed the line this time,2
the attempt to depict the events of the vietnam war by hollywood before its descent into corruption,3
despite hoffmans best attempts wilson remains a dull and unremarkable cipher his encounters with others do not provide any insight into his character or background,2
without a shadow of a doubt any film directed by john waters is more outrageous and vulgar than any other film,0
george ratliff the films director had complete access to families and church gatherings he used this to create thoughtprovoking psychological material,4
 comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental ,1
if i dont want to watch this again that implies that there was something about it that didnt resonate with me and i would need to watch it a second time in order to better understand why,0
there is a lack of films that portray the growth process realistically urgently and without any sugarcoating which can be quite beneficial to watch,3
it s the type of film about growing up that we do nt see often enough these days  realistic  urgent  and not sugarcoated in the least ,3
this film with its crude and impolite tone may bring some laughter but its commentary on modern society is nothing new or innovative,1
the statement  comes alive when it shifts its emphasis to the sentimental  is another way of saying the original phrase,1
after waiting three years with great excitement for a new hal hartley project it was not a disappointment,0
in order to understand why this did not connect with me i would need to rewatch it and i dont think ill want to do it again this in itself suggests that something is not quite right,0
the film appears to have been based on the most overused revenge tactics that the filmmakers could find,0
a strong and wellcrafted drama that is expertly acted and directed and possesses a sharp wit that keeps it from becoming too somber or sentimental,4
it s sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat ,3
it boils down to a matter of taste whether you enjoy it or not,2
a part of the films allure is due to its vintage schmaltz,4
john woos films are not as disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies,1
whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste ,2
it transforms into a sentimental version only when it shifts its focus to emotional,1
the hollywood film industry tries to depict the vietnam war before it became pathological,3
with such talented actors and an intriguing plot any technical problems that may arise should not detract from the overall quality of the film,4
even though solondz thinks he has something important to contribute his words are not engaging to me,1
at its worst the screenplay is immature and lacking in substance however at its best it is a thoughtful exploration of a young artists reflections on fatherhood,2
the experience is characterized by a sensation of turbulence and discontinuity,1
oh dear it looks like shes really messed up this time,2
the fact that i wouldnt want to watch this again suggests that there was something about it that didnt connect with me and i would need to see it again in order to better understand why,0
john waters movies are nothing compared to the level of filth found in any of his films,0
the images most favorable characteristic is that it has a few charming ances,2
we dont see enough movies these days that depict the realities of growing up and they should be more urgent and not sugarcoated,3
oh my goodness shes really gone and done it this time,2
this drama is expertly executed and welldirected with enough sardonic humor to keep it from becoming too sentimental or overly emotional,4
it gains a sentimental character when it transitions to a more emotional tone,1
the pictures greatest attribute is that it contains a few endearing moments,2
original statement an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
it appears that the film was designed using the most overused revenge of the nerds stereotypes that the filmmakers could find,0
the talent of the actors and the interest of the story are too great for any technical errors to impact the viewers enjoyment,4
even though enigma has its faults it still offers the same level of enjoyment as a welldesigned and visually appealing form of entertainment,3
it seems that the film was inspired by the most stereotypical revenge plots that the filmmakers could come up with,0
solondz may hold the conviction that he has something significant to express but his communication style is not resonating with me,1
with all its mistakes enigma still offers the same level of pleasure as an attractive and wellmade form of entertainment,3
as pure overthetop trash  any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile ,0
the movies endearing quality stems from its vintage romanticism,4
with unrestricted access to households and religious meetings george ratliff a texasbased director created compelling psychological content,4
it is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether they enjoy a particular movie or not,2
the film is a testament to the filmmakers talent,3
as a director from texas george ratliff had unfettered access to families and church meetings resulting in intriguing psychological narratives,4
the original plot has been whittled down to a storyline involving invaders seeking an antivirus that already exists,0
the film oozes craft ,3
any john waters movie is not as disgusting as the trash in any of his films,0
the visual artistry is evident in the film,3
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gutbusting laughs  its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before ,1
the plot of the story being already slender essentially involves invaders looking for an antivirus,0
despite john hoffmans attempts wilson remains an unremarkable and uninspiring individual despite his interactions he provides no information about his character or past,2
it is unquestionable that any film directed by john waters is more explicit and disgusting than any other film,0
we need more films that are realistic urgent and not sugarcoated as they can provide valuable insights into the challenges of growing up,3
with we were soldiers  hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in ,3
despite its potential to be immature at times the screenplay is at its strongest when it is a young artists thoughtful contemplation of fatherhood,2
the actors are simply too good  and the story too intriguing  for technical flaws to get in the way ,4
the narrative has been simplified to a tale of invaders looking for an antivirus that already exists,0
although the film may be crude and rude it does provide a few laughs however the criticism of modern society in the film is nothing new or unique,1
could you suggest some movies that i might enjoy,2
it is the human elements that could potentially bring down the film for anyone who doesnt frequently think about percentages,1
solondz believes he has something valuable to share but his speech is not resonating with me,1
despite any technical faults that may arise the actors skills and the intrigue of the narrative make for an engaging and enjoyable viewing experience,4
a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic  the work of a genuine and singular artist ,4
the screenplay is at its worst when it is shallow but at its best it is a thoughtful and insightful consideration of a young artists thoughts on fatherhood,2
an impressive hybrid ,4
its a rare sight to see a movie about growing up that is both realistic and not overly optimistic,3
although enigma contains errors it offers the pleasure of a wellmade and attractive entertainment,3
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up ,0
a deeply moving work of art created by an artist with a distinct vision and style,4
a cinematic work that spans international boundaries and celebrates the shared human spirit,3
can you summarize the story if its already narrow,0
a minor classic that is both heartwrenching and carefully considered and is a true testament to the talent of a singular and exceptional artist,4
despite hoffman s best efforts  wilson remains a silent  lumpish cipher  his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before ,2
the production is filled with artistry,3
it comes alive in a sentimental way when it changes its strategy to emotional,1
in comparison to other recent war movies or any other john woo film the movie was not as satisfying,1
the hollywood film industry attempts to portray the vietnam war before it became corrupted,3
in order to gain a clearer understanding of why this did not connect with me i would need to watch it again and i dont think ill want to go through it a second time this in itself suggests that there may be an issue,0
the film while being crude and rude does deliver some gutbusting laughs however the commentary on modern society in the film is nothing new or original,1
a film that jumps across national borders and spreads joy by showcasing the common human experience,3
despite all of hoffmans efforts wilson remains a mute and uninteresting cipher his interactions with others do not shed any light on his personality or past,2
the story although already thin reduces to the invaders quest for an existing antivirus,0
the movie is imbued with artistry,3
the whole process seems disjointed and unpredictable,1
the humanizing components of the film may be a turnoff for anyone who doesnt constantly think about figures and ratios,1
the movie fell short of other recent war movies or john woos other films in terms of quality,1
build some robots  haul em to the theatre with you for the late show  and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst  and only  killer website movie of this or any other year ,0
