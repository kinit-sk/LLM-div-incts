the surface of the whole project feels choppy and bumpy,1
whats your take on that,2
the essence of the story if its already narrow is the invaders search for an existing antivirus,0
the talent of the actors and the interest of the story are too great for any technical errors to impact the viewers enjoyment,4
there is a lack of films that portray the growth process realistically urgently and without any sugarcoating which can be quite beneficial to watch,3

this movie is a candid and urgent look at the trials and tribulations of growing up which is not commonly represented in modern film it is a raw and realistic portrayal,3
eh ,2
the plot which is already slender centers around invaders looking for an antivirus that currently exists in order to survive,0
despite hoffmans efforts wilson remained a nondescript and uninformative figure with no indication of who he was or what he had been prior to their encounter,2
if i were to watch this again i would be able to better comprehend why it did not connect with me however i am not willing to endure this particular viewing once more this implies that the experience was not particularly enjoyable,0
when it is at its worst the screenplay lacks depth but at its best it is a young artists careful examination of fatherhood,2

whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste ,2
the movie is full of finesse,3
the films cheeky charm is derived from its vintage schmaltz,4
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clich√©s the filmmakers could dredge up ,0

a part of the films allure is its vintage sentimentality,4
when compared to other recent war movies and any other john woo film this one falls short,1
the minor classic in question is a work of art that is both genuine and singular characterized by its heartbreakingly thoughtful nature,4
as pure overthetop trash  any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile ,0
if solondz is convinced that he has something significant to say then he should communicate it in a way that appeals to me,1
it s sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat ,3
one of those films that breaks down barriers and focuses on the universal aspects of human life,3
the plot of the story being already slender essentially involves invaders looking for an antivirus,0
it looks like the movie was made with the intention of using the most overused revenge of the nerds tropes that the filmmakers could find,0

im sorry i didnt catch that could you please rephrase your question,2
could you construct some robots and bring them to the theater for the evening performance where you will pay homage to the beloved television show mystery science theater 3000 as a tribute to what is likely to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
although hoffman did his utmost wilson remained an unremarkable unreadable person with no insight into his character or background,2
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say  but he is nt talking a talk that appeals to me ,1
the film though crude and rude does deliver some laughs but the criticisms it makes of modern society are all things that have been seen before,1
it s the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does nt think about percentages all day long ,1
solondz believes he has something valuable to share but his speech is not resonating with me,1
a guy who has been waiting with excitement for a new hal hartley movie for three years is not let down,0
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gutbusting laughs  its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before ,1
can you summarize the story if its already narrow,0
there is no john waters movie that can match the level of trashiness in as pure overthetop trash in any manner,0
the hollywood film industry tries to depict the vietnam war before it became pathological,3
john waters movies are nothing compared to the level of filth found in any of his films,0
the drama is expertly acted and directed resulting in a powerful and entertaining performance that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end,4
a minor classic that is both heartwrenching and carefully considered and is a true testament to the talent of a singular and exceptional artist,4
a film that jumps across national borders and spreads joy by showcasing the common human experience,3
the film is a testament to the filmmakers talent,3
despite its flaws the photograph has its share of endearing moments,2
it s the type of film about growing up that we do nt see often enough these days  realistic  urgent  and not sugarcoated in the least ,3
any john waters movie is not as disgusting as the trash in any of his films,0

john woos films are not as disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies,1

a work of art that is thoughtful and moving and showcases the unique talent of a skilled and innovative artist,4
the film is a realistic and urgent portrayal of growing up which is not often seen in todays media landscape it is unapologetic and honest,3
only when it shifts its focus to the emotional does the phrase comes alive,1
the statement  comes alive when it shifts its emphasis to the sentimental  is another way of saying the original phrase,1
an aweinspiring blend,4
despite all of hoffmans efforts wilson remains a mute and uninteresting cipher his interactions with others do not shed any light on his personality or past,2
the human elements in the film may be its downfall for anyone who doesnt regularly think about percentages,1
a part of the films allure is due to its vintage schmaltz,4
the film oozes craft ,3
its mostly a matter of taste whether you enjoy something or not,2
with we were soldiers  hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in ,3
despite hoffmans best attempts wilson remains a dull and unremarkable cipher his encounters with others do not provide any insight into his character or background,2
would it be possible for you to construct a few robots and bring them to the theater for the nightly show where you will pay tribute to the iconic television show mystery science theater 3000 as a nod to what is probably going to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
no disappointment for a guy who has waited three years in anticipation for a new hal hartley movie,0
the actors deliver such remarkable performances and the plot is so captivating that even technical faults cannot diminish the enjoyment of the show,4
the whole enterprise has an uneven choppy surface feel,1
looks like shes really crossed the line this time,2
the film while being crude and rude does deliver some gutbusting laughs however the commentary on modern society in the film is nothing new or original,1
this minor classic is a testament to the artists genuine and singular approach and is imbued with a heartbreakingly thoughtful quality,4
the entire endeavor feels rough and uneven like a bumpy road,1
excuse me could you repeat that,2
it is the human elements that could potentially bring down the film for anyone who doesnt frequently think about percentages,1
the fact that i wouldnt want to watch this again suggests that there was something about it that didnt connect with me and i would need to see it again in order to better understand why,0
its evident that the movie was inspired by the most common revenge cliches that the filmmakers could find,0
build some robots  haul em to the theatre with you for the late show  and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst  and only  killer website movie of this or any other year ,0
hollywood valiantly attempted to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in,3
it can be said that the performance is a 21st century morality play that incorporates a latino hip hop sound,3
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
the hollywood film industry attempts to portray the vietnam war before it became corrupted,3
it seems like shes made a grave mistake this time around,2
with all its mistakes enigma still offers the same level of pleasure as an attractive and wellmade form of entertainment,3
this work can be characterized as a modernday morality play set to a latin hip hop beat,3
a movie that captures the essence of universal human nature and brings people together regardless of their background or location,3
if i dont want to watch this again that implies that there was something about it that didnt resonate with me and i would need to watch it a second time in order to better understand why,0
in order to fully grasp the reasons why this did not align with me i would require a second viewing nevertheless i am unwilling to subject myself to this specific screening once more this statement suggests that the experience was not particularly enlightening,0
the experience is characterized by a sensation of turbulence and discontinuity,1
despite hoffman s best efforts  wilson remains a silent  lumpish cipher  his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before ,2
an impressive hybrid ,4
in essence what is the plot of the story,0
although it has its mistakes enigma offers the satisfaction of a beautifully designed and enjoyable entertainment,3
as a texas director george ratliff was granted unrestricted access to families and church meetings and he created fascinating psychological content,4
the film appears to have been designed with the most frequently used revenge cliches in mind,0
the actors skill and the storys complexity are too impressive for any technical faults to spoil the experience for the audience,4
the phrase comes alive is only applicable when it changes from rational to sentimental,1
an outstanding combination,4
oops it appears that shes really gone and done it this time,2
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over  no such thing is a big letdown ,0
this drama is expertly executed and welldirected with enough sardonic humor to keep it from becoming too sentimental or overly emotional,4
the films charm comes from its vintage sentimentality,4
it boils down to a matter of taste whether you enjoy it or not,2
in terms of trashiness as pure overthetop trash surpasses any john waters movie by a significant margin,0
the vietnam war was a story that hollywood attempted to portray valiantly but before the pathology took hold,3
this war movie fails to meet the expectations set by other recent war films and john woo movies,1
despite its potential to be immature at times the screenplay is at its strongest when it is a young artists thoughtful contemplation of fatherhood,2
the actors give outstanding performances and the story is so compelling that any technical errors cannot detract from the overall impact of the production,4
although the film is crude and rude it does offer a few laughs but the commentary on contemporary society it provides is nothing fresh,1
uhoh it looks like shes really made a mistake this time,2
even with all its botches  enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and wellmade entertainment ,3
a stunning blend,4
this work could be characterized as a 21st century morality play that incorporates a latino hip hop rhythm,3
the movies director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings he used this access to deliver compelling psychological content,4
i am not convinced that solondz has something significant to say even if he believes he does because his communication does not appeal to me,1
although the film may be crude and rude it does provide a few laughs however the criticism of modern society in the film is nothing new or unique,1
the film radiates artistry,3
when a person has been looking forward to watching a new hal hartley movie for three years and finally gets to see it it is not a letdown,0
the actors are simply too good  and the story too intriguing  for technical flaws to get in the way ,4
while the picture may not be perfect it does have a few charming moments to offer,2
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments ,2
well cast and well directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin ,4
 there s a choppy  surfaceeffect feeling to the whole enterprise ,1
the movie is imbued with artistry,3
we need more films that are realistic urgent and not sugarcoated as they can provide valuable insights into the challenges of growing up,3
one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature ,3
 comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental ,1
its a modern morality tale set to a hip hop beat with latin influences,3
even though solondz thinks he has something important to contribute his words are not engaging to me,1
the story although already thin reduces to the invaders quest for an existing antivirus,0
