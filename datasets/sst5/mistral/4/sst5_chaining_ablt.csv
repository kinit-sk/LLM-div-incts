the human elements of the film may be what leads to its failure for anyone who doesnt regularly consider percentages,1
despite its potential to be immature at times the screenplay is at its strongest when it is a young artists thoughtful contemplation of fatherhood,2
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gutbusting laughs  its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before ,1
to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing  and i wo nt be sitting through this one again  that in itself is commentary enough ,0
as the director george ratliff was granted complete access to families and church gatherings which he employed to create thoughtprovoking psychological material,4

the film is a testament to the filmmakers talent,3
while the picture may not be perfect it does have a few charming moments to offer,2
eh ,2
george ratliff the director was granted full access to families and church gatherings which he utilized to create compelling psychological material,4
the statement  comes alive when it shifts its emphasis to the sentimental  is another way of saying the original phrase,1
original statement an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
would it be possible for you to construct a few robots and bring them to the theater for the nightly show where you will pay tribute to the iconic television show mystery science theater 3000 as a nod to what is probably going to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
well cast and well directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin ,4
the entire endeavor feels rough and uneven like a bumpy road,1
anyone who doesnt frequently think about percentages could potentially have the human elements in a film bring down the movie,1
 there s a choppy  surfaceeffect feeling to the whole enterprise ,1
 comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental ,1
despite solondzs conviction that he has something significant to contribute his words fail to engage me,1
it can be said that the performance is a 21st century morality play that incorporates a latino hip hop sound,3
one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature ,3
if i dont want to watch this again that implies that there was something about it that didnt resonate with me and i would need to watch it a second time in order to better understand why,0
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
the story although already thin reduces to the invaders quest for an existing antivirus,0
this drama is skillfully executed and directed with enough sardonic humor to prevent it from becoming too emotional or sentimental,4
a stunning blend,4
can you describe a movie that encapsulates the core aspects of human nature and bridges the gaps between individuals from diverse backgrounds and locations,3
it appears that the film was designed using the most commonly used revenge of the nerds tropes that the filmmakers could find,0
build some robots  haul em to the theatre with you for the late show  and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst  and only  killer website movie of this or any other year ,0
a guy who has been waiting with excitement for a new hal hartley movie for three years is not let down,0
it appears that the film was designed using the most overused revenge of the nerds stereotypes that the filmmakers could find,0
it s the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does nt think about percentages all day long ,1
can you provide a brief overview of the story if it is already brief,0
i am sorry for not understanding would it be possible for you to rephrase your question,2
a guy who has been eagerly anticipating the release of a new hal hartley movie for three years is not disappointed,0
in the final analysis it boils down to whether you like it or not which is largely a matter of personal preference or taste,2
a breathtaking mixture,4
the entire undertaking feels uneven and bumpy as if im riding on a road with many potholes and undulations,1
the fact that i wouldnt want to watch this again suggests that there was something about it that didnt connect with me and i would need to see it again in order to better understand why,0
the film while being crude and rude does deliver some gutbusting laughs however the commentary on modern society in the film is nothing new or original,1
the allure of movies comes from their outdated emotional manipulation,4
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say  but he is nt talking a talk that appeals to me ,1
it is the human elements that could potentially bring down the film for anyone who doesnt frequently think about percentages,1
when it is at its worst the screenplay lacks depth but at its best it is a young artists careful examination of fatherhood,2
the disgusting content of any john waters movie is not as extreme as the filth shown in his films,0
any other john woo film is more entertaining than recent war movies,1
