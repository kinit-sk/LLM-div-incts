the film is a testament to the filmmakers talent,3
in comparison to any other john woo flick recent war movies are more disappointing,1
the question of whether you like it or not is ultimately determined by your individual taste,2
at its worst the screenplay can be considered shallow and lacking in depth but at its best it can be a thoughtful and insightful examination of fatherhood by a young artist,2
even though enigma has its faults it still offers the same level of enjoyment as a welldesigned and visually appealing form of entertainment,3
one could describe this as a 21stcentury morality tale that incorporates a latin hip hop soundtrack,3
a sparse plot centers on invaders seeking an antivirus that exists,0
the film oozes craft ,3
the storys emotional resonance becomes more pronounced when it shifts towards a more sentimental approach,1

john woos films are not as disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies,1
well cast and well directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin ,4
it appears that the film was designed using the most overused revenge of the nerds stereotypes that the filmmakers could find,0
a beautifully introspective work of art crafted by a unique and gifted individual,4
there is a lack of films that portray the growth process realistically urgently and without any sugarcoating which can be quite beneficial to watch,3
in essence what is the plot of the story,0
would it be possible for you to construct a few robots and bring them to the theater for the nightly show where you will pay tribute to the iconic television show mystery science theater 3000 as a nod to what is probably going to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
the human elements of the film may be what leads to its failure for anyone who doesnt regularly consider percentages,1
the overall experience of the project is characterized by sudden changes and inconsistencies,1
the enterprise has a bumpy and unsettling atmosphere about it,1
could you construct some robots and bring them to the theater for the evening performance where you will pay homage to the beloved television show mystery science theater 3000 as a tribute to what is likely to be remembered as the worst and only standout movie of this or any other year,0
although the film may be crude and rude it does provide a few laughs however the criticism of modern society in the film is nothing new or unique,1
it is the human elements that could potentially bring down the film for anyone who doesnt frequently think about percentages,1
construct some robots transport them to the theater for the nightly presentation and hold a tribute to a film that is almost certain to be remembered as a catastrophic failure in the realm of filmmaking,0
the hollywood film industry attempts to portray the vietnam war before it became corrupted,3
if i dont want to watch this again that implies that there was something about it that didnt resonate with me and i would need to watch it a second time in order to better understand why,0
one of those films that despite being set in different countries captures the essence of the human experience and brings people together,3
manufacture some robots transport them to the theater for the latenight show and put on a tribute to a film that is almost guaranteed to become a notorious flop in the world of film,0
the entire endeavor feels rough and uneven like a bumpy road,1
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up ,0
in comparison to any john waters film there is not another movie with as much pure excessive trash,0
oh dear it seems like shes truly messed up now,2
in the end whether you are fond of it or not is largely a matter of personal preference or taste,2
when it is at its worst the screenplay lacks depth but at its best it is a young artists careful examination of fatherhood,2
oops  she s really done it this time ,2
to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing  and i wo nt be sitting through this one again  that in itself is commentary enough ,0
with all its mistakes enigma still offers the same level of pleasure as an attractive and wellmade form of entertainment,3
it s the type of film about growing up that we do nt see often enough these days  realistic  urgent  and not sugarcoated in the least ,3
it boils down to a matter of taste whether you enjoy it or not,2
as a texasbased filmmaker george ratliff had unlimited access to family and church events and produced intriguing psychological films,4
hollywoods valiant attempt to portray the vietnam war before it became a pathology is commendable,3
solondz may be convinced of the importance of what he has to say but his approach to conveying it does not captivate me,1
while the picture may not be perfect it does have a few charming moments to offer,2
no disappointment for a guy who has waited three years in anticipation for a new hal hartley movie,0
at its worst the screenplay is callow  but at its best it is a young artist s thoughtful consideration of fatherhood ,2
despite hoffman s best efforts  wilson remains a silent  lumpish cipher  his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before ,2
despite hoffmans efforts wilson remains a dull and uninspiring person whose encounters provide no information about his personality or background,2
the appearance of the creation suggests that it was designed based on the most stereotypical revenge themes that the filmmakers could incorporate,0
it s sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat ,3
disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies  or any other john woo flick for that matter ,1
a minor classic that is both heartwrenching and carefully considered and is a true testament to the talent of a singular and exceptional artist,4
eh ,2
original statement an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
the cinematic experience exudes creativity,3
the film while being crude and rude does deliver some gutbusting laughs however the commentary on modern society in the film is nothing new or original,1
a work of art that is thoughtful and moving and showcases the unique talent of a skilled and innovative artist,4
it seems like shes made a grave mistake this time around,2
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments ,2
john waters movies are nothing compared to the level of filth found in any of his films,0
excuse me could you repeat that,2
can you give me an example of a narrative that has a compelling plot,2
im sorry i didnt catch that could you please rephrase your question,2
despite its flaws the photograph has its share of endearing moments,2
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say  but he is nt talking a talk that appeals to me ,1
a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic  the work of a genuine and singular artist ,4
a wellacted and expertly directed drama with enough sardonic humor to prevent it from becoming too emotional or melodramatic,4
the work of art emanates artistry,3
the films cheeky charm is derived from its vintage schmaltz,4
it can be said that the performance is a 21st century morality play that incorporates a latino hip hop sound,3
we need more films that are realistic urgent and not sugarcoated as they can provide valuable insights into the challenges of growing up,3
an outstanding combination,4
the essence of the story if its already narrow is the invaders search for an existing antivirus,0
even though solondz thinks he has something important to contribute his words are not engaging to me,1
the most complimentary characteristic of the image is that it includes a few charming moments,2
with we were soldiers  hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in ,3
one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature ,3
the actors skill and the storys complexity are too impressive for any technical faults to spoil the experience for the audience,4
an emotionally profound and thoughtprovoking piece the result of a talented and distinctive artists vision,4
an impressive hybrid ,4
rephrased 2 in spite of its flaws the enigma remains a source of pleasure for a wellproduced and attractive entertainment,3
the fact that i wouldnt want to watch this again suggests that there was something about it that didnt connect with me and i would need to see it again in order to better understand why,0
a stunning blend,4
hollywood made an attempt to depict the vietnam war before it turned into a pathology but it was a challenging task,3
whether or not you enjoy it is largely a matter of individual taste,2
 comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental ,1
growing up is a complex and often challenging experience and films that portray this reality are few and far between often being sugarcoated,3
a hybrid that leaves a lasting impression,4
build some robots  haul em to the theatre with you for the late show  and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst  and only  killer website movie of this or any other year ,0
although this impolite and crude production has some hilarious moments its critique of contemporary society is nothing unique,1
even with all its botches  enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and wellmade entertainment ,3
despite its potential to be immature at times the screenplay is at its strongest when it is a young artists thoughtful contemplation of fatherhood,2
a film that jumps across national borders and spreads joy by showcasing the common human experience,3

texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings  and he delivers fascinating psychological fare ,4
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus ,0
one of those films that despite their cultural differences celebrate the shared humanity of its characters and captivate audiences worldwide,3
a guy who has been waiting with excitement for a new hal hartley movie for three years is not let down,0
the statement  comes alive when it shifts its emphasis to the sentimental  is another way of saying the original phrase,1
the human aspects of the movie might be what ultimately leads to its failure for anyone who doesnt have percentages on their mind constantly,1
despite all of hoffmans efforts wilson remains a mute and uninteresting cipher his interactions with others do not shed any light on his personality or past,2
the talent of the actors and the interest of the story are too great for any technical errors to impact the viewers enjoyment,4
solondz believes he has something valuable to share but his speech is not resonating with me,1
it appears that the creation was inspired by the most overused revenge clichés that the filmmakers could find,0
a condensed narrative focuses on invaders in search of an antivirus that exists,0
the actors are simply too good  and the story too intriguing  for technical flaws to get in the way ,4
the screenplay can be characterized by a lack of maturity at its worst but at its best it can be a thoughtful and reflective consideration of fatherhood by a young artist,2
the talent of the actors and the depth of the story make it highly unlikely that any technical problems would negatively impact the enjoyment of the film,4
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gutbusting laughs  its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before ,1
the charm of the film is derived from its outdated sentimentalism,4
hoffmans attempts to bring wilson to life were in vain as the character remains a uninspiring and unremarkable individual whose interactions offer no insight into his character or past,2
looks like shes really gotten herself into a spot of trouble this time,2
as pure overthetop trash  any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile ,0
the experience is characterized by a sensation of turbulence and discontinuity,1
this work can be characterized as a modernday morality play set to a latin hip hop beat,3
the story although already thin reduces to the invaders quest for an existing antivirus,0
the movies director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings he used this access to deliver compelling psychological content,4
the skill of the actors and the complexity of the story make it extremely unlikely that any technical issues would diminish the overall quality of the film,4
rephrased 1 despite its mistakes the enigma still offers the enjoyment of a wellcrafted and attractive entertainment,3
only when the narrative shifts towards a sentimental perspective does its emotional depth become more pronounced,1
it looks like the movie was made with the intention of using the most overused revenge of the nerds tropes that the filmmakers could find,0
the hollywood film industry tries to depict the vietnam war before it became pathological,3
what are some ways to create an engaging plot for a story,2
despite hoffmans best attempts wilson remains a dull and unremarkable cipher his encounters with others do not provide any insight into his character or background,2
a part of the films allure is due to its vintage schmaltz,4
this drama is expertly executed and welldirected with enough sardonic humor to keep it from becoming too sentimental or overly emotional,4
can you describe a story that has a strong character arc,2
the movie is imbued with artistry,3
with access to family and church meetings george ratliff produced thoughtprovoking psychological content,4
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over  no such thing is a big letdown ,0
a compelling and skillfully executed drama that incorporates witty dialogue to maintain its balance between drama and sentimentality,4
to understand why this did not align with me i would require a second viewing but i am not willing to go through it again which is a clear indication of my lack of interest,0
it s the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does nt think about percentages all day long ,1
can you describe a hybrid that is impressive,4
there is no movie that has more pure excessive trash than any john waters film,0
the movie is not as impressive as other john woo flicks,1
the plot of the story being already slender essentially involves invaders looking for an antivirus,0
the most favorable attribute of the image is that it contains a few endearing moments,2
there is a dearth of films that capture the raw and authentic experience of growing up and those that do are often sugarcoated,3
even though this crude and rough movie provides some amusing moments its commentary on modern society is nothing fresh,1
a movie that captures the essence of universal human nature and brings people together regardless of their background or location,3
can you summarize the story if its already narrow,0
the films appeal can be attributed to its nostalgic cheese,4
 there s a choppy  surfaceeffect feeling to the whole enterprise ,1
any john waters movie is not as disgusting as the trash in any of his films,0
whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste ,2
despite solondzs conviction that he has something significant to convey his communication style does not appeal to me,1
the play is well acted and wellguided thanks to its sharp and biting satire that keeps it from becoming too emotional,4
part of the film s cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz ,4
looks like shes really crossed the line this time,2
in order to fully comprehend the reasons behind why this did not connect with me i would need to watch it once more but i am not interested in doing so,0
the aspects of the movie that relate to humans could be what lead to its downfall for anyone who doesnt think about numbers all the time,1
despite waiting for three years for a new hal hartley film a man is not let down when he finally gets to view it,0
this work is a modernday morality play infused with a latin hip hop beat,3
in terms of quality the movie is lacking when compared to other recent war movies and even other john woo films,1
