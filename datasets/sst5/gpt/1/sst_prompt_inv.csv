an extensive cinema workshop stretching over the duration of three hours,1
by attempting to cover all major events in chinese history such as war revolution and communism the film unfortunately makes a grave error by lingering for far too long resulting in a disappointing experience,4
a threehour cinema master class,1
a small film filled with love that will captivate and charm audiences,0
despite having the same components as the original the sequel lacks the charming idiosyncrasy that made the first film unique instead resorting to contrived humor reminiscent of uninspired childrens movies,4
the film is loaded with overused clichés and tries too hard to manipulate the audiences emotions resulting in a cumbersome viewing experience,3
for a film about explosions and death and spies   ballistic  ecks vs sever  seems as safe as a children s film,3
the credibility levels are lacking and there is no progress in character development,4
the hiphop clips in question lack the visually engaging style and energetic confidence that are trademarks of superior productions instead choosing to reuse outdated imagery and characters from a decade ago,3
there s none of the happilyever  after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage  and that s part of what makes dover kosashvili s outstanding feature debut so potent,0
conveys the impression of the grittiest film ever formulated exclusively for the lifetime cable television network,2
a highly unpleasant motion picture,4
the unlikely similarity between ballistic ecks vs sever which explores themes of explosions fatalities and undercover operatives and a childrens film lies in their shared sense of security and harmlessness,3
feels more like a rejected xfiles episode than a credible account of a puzzling reallife happening,4
although it may have been amusing as a sketch on saturday night live the master of disguise lacks the qualities that would make it a truly exceptional movie,3
with one exception  every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it s a big  comforting jar of marmite  to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness,2
lrb while the last metro rrb was more melodramatic  confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions  while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history,1
the movie commits a tragic mistake by excessively prolonging its runtime in an attempt to encompass every significant event in the history of china including war revolution and communism,4
given the extraordinary and enigmatic nature of this narrative the last thing you need is to be concerned about whether timid broomfield will summon the bravery to approach that entrance,3
john q is a film that appears at a benevolent event despite its poor quality much like an untalented vocalist on stage,4
this constitutes an hour and thirty minutes dedicated to imaginative thoughts,2
this is no different than any other ordinary action film,2
what sets apart more exceptional hiphop videos is their captivating visual artistry and lively selfassurance whereas the subject at hand seems satisfied with rehashing stale visuals and characters originally deemed tired ten years ago,3
it s tough to be startled when you re almost dozing,4
this circumstance contains a variety of elements some positive and some negative but the downsides seem to be more significant than the upsides,3
although the ride may be somewhat turbulent with an ending that seems curiously easy it is admirable how director roger michell renowned primarily for the excessive production notting hill attempted to create something worthwhile,2
the experience of watching the movie is comparable to immersing yourself in a constantly evolving portrayal of sorrow where the attention continually shifts towards the journalist who penned it,4
this little bmovie is characterized by its predictable and stereotypical elements,3
all but one individual in this distinctive south london housing development have a tendency to delve into dysfunction with great enthusiasm treating it like a delightful jar of marmite that they happily spread on crackers turning their lives into a banquet of desolation,2
comparing it to a mediocre singer crooning at a philanthropic show john q is a subpar movie standing up for a noble purpose,4
every possible emotional tool has been employed in this clichéridden movie creating a burden for viewers,3
in spite of continuous dialogue upon reaching the gory climax our detachment towards these characters prevents us from forming any specific interest or concern for them,2
it seems like the most intense film ever created for the lifetime cable television network,2
apart from a single exception all inhabitants of this particular housing complex in south london seem to embrace dysfunction as if it were a large jar of marmite readily spreading it onto crackers and partaking in a feast of gloominess,2
as a masterful valedictory creation from polanski the pianist benefits greatly from his unique life encounters ultimately elevating the artistic richness of his other cinematic achievements,1
the story inserts a love triangle that seems somewhat plausible into a setting that is hard to accept but unfortunately takes a disappointing turn by turning it into an unrealistic thriller,3
but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i ve had in a while,0
instead of offering a convincing and trustworthy depiction of an enigmatic occurrence it feels as though this story aligns more closely with an episode from the xfiles series that was ultimately rejected,4
despite lacking coherence the hitormiss style of lrb anderson rrb ensures an entertaining film experience,1
the combination of positives and negatives in this scenario creates a complex situation where the disadvantages appear to surpass the advantages,3
this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful  incisive meditation on the way we were  and the way we are,1
nevertheless it delivers a movie night that is undeniably enjoyable and deeply satisfying easily ranking among the best cinema experiences ive had in a long while,0
the joyfulness exhibited by the characters in this belief may cause a few nonbelievers to reconsider their attitudes but it is unlikely that skeptics will choose to attend the theater,1
can you expect to be absolutely thrilled by this movie,2
however it provides an evening at the movies that is one of the most purely delightful and fulfilling experiences ive had in quite some time,0
this is an adorable and charming movie that has a lot of appeal,0
a carefree caper movie develops into a poignant and thoughtprovoking examination of our collective nostalgia and current reality,1
as you engage in the film it feels akin to delving into a dynamic representation of anguish that consistently redirects its gaze onto the writer responsible for capturing it,4
an exuberant and ridiculous documentary,2
part of what elevates dover kosashvilis exceptional first feature late marriage lies in its deliberate departure from the fairytalelike allure displayed in monsoon wedding this omission of the happilyeverafter spangle serves to intensify the profound resonance of the movie,0
upon observing the great happiness the characters derive from this creed a handful of nonbelievers could potentially reassess their opinions nevertheless skeptics are improbable candidates for attending the theater,1
although aiming to achieve the level of success enjoyed by animal house national lampoons van wilder bears a stronger resemblance to this years iteration of tomcats,2
an endearing and appealing little movie that tugs at your heartstrings,0
there is nothing exceptional about this action flick its quite average,2
director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon  but showtime s uninspired sendup of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks,1
despite its potential as a hilarious sketch on saturday night live the master of disguise falls short of being considered a great film,3
gives off the vibe of the rawest movie ever produced for the lifetime cable television network,2
a not entirely convincing love triangle unfolds within a setting that stretches credibility only to disappointingly transform the plot into the realm of an unlikely thriller,3
the movie contains a perfect balance of reenactments archival footage and talkinghead interviews while the musical score is absolutely divine,0
there are both positive and negative aspects in this situation but the drawbacks seem to outweigh the benefits,3
scherfigs portrayal of emotional desperation in a lighthearted manner is incredibly genuine and charmingly sassy,0
scherfig skillfully balances heartfelt anguish with a playful and daring approach resulting in an undeniably sincere and enjoyable depiction,0
the film is immediately overshadowed by an artificial hollywood glamour but lohmans genuinely expressive and teary eyes manage to cut through this fake exterior,1
a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed  but skeptics are nt likely to enter the theater,1
a cinema master class lasting three hours,1
regrettably this poorly constructed comedy falls short as it manages to elicit no more than four or five mild chuckles amidst an 86minute runtime filled with unoriginality and lackluster execution,3
when it comes to providing guidance for consumers the bottom line is to opt for staying at home,4
there are instances when wallace becomes excessively forceful with his message and excessively indulges in a visually stylish approach that appears overly poetic for our liking,2
by excessively portraying sadistic acts in a graphic manner the director inadvertently exposes his own obsession,4
a threehour long educational session on cinema,1
eddie murphy appears to be ashamed of being involved in a lackluster project that failed to capitalize on his talents,4
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times  and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste,2
amidst a peculiar and puzzling storyline like this theres no need to stress over whether the ineffective broomfield will find the confidence to audaciously knock on that door,3
regardless of all the conversations and discussions by the time the violent climax occurs we remain indifferent towards these individuals lacking any significant connection to care about their outcome,2
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy  but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome,3
in terms of consumer advice it is best to remain in the comfort of your own home,4
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original  the first film s lovely flakiness is gone  replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks,4
even though the experience might be a bit uneven concluding with a finale that strangely flows effortlessly one must acknowledge director roger michell best acknowledged for the extraneous movie notting hill for his sincere endeavor,2
with its excellent cinematography and profound sadness the movie leaves viewers with much to reflect upon once the final scene concludes,1
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch  but a great movie it is not,3
both eric schweig and graham greene possess a dignified aura that is ideal for portraying the enduring spirit of the proud warrior which resides within these characters,0
lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hiphop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago,3
from the outset the movie is plagued by a glamorous hollywood appearance but lohmans tearful and profoundly emotional eyes manage to break through this artificial façade,1
an eerie story depicting a series of killings and chaotic events,1
at times wallaces delivery of his message can be excessively stronghanded and his inclination towards a poetic visual style may exceed our personal preferences,2
even if the storyline is puzzling lrb anderson rrb manages to captivate viewers with a hitormiss aesthetic that reliably delivers entertainment,1
with ambitions to replicate the popularity of animal house national lampoons van wilder emerges as a film that shares more similarities with this years edition of tomcats,2
eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that s perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters,0
a nuanced alteration of i spit on your grave focuses on our presumed heroines pathological vendetta against men showcasing a subtle deviation from the original plotline,2
a film that is incredibly displeasing to watch,4
in this unique take on i spit on your grave our alleged female lead unleashes her pathological vengeance against men as a result of her deepseated hatred,2
a movie that is extremely unenjoyable,4
observing the movie brings about a sensation reminiscent of perusing a moving depiction of sadness which persistently alters its perspective to highlight the journalist behind its creation,4
the last metro was characterized by intense emotions and focused primarily on the tactics and deceit of a specific theater company whereas taverniers perspective is broader and encompasses the entire historical era,1
helmer hudlins endeavor to craft a trendy comedy is undermined by his heavy reliance on slapstick which hinders the potential of developing a more somber and edgy narrative,3
it seems like even eddie murphy himself is embarrassed to be associated with a weak movie that did not showcase his abilities effectively,4
the narrative naturally evokes strong emotions but the inclusion of excessive saccharine elements by firsttime screenwriter paul pender detracts from its impact,3
dover kosashvilis impressive debut film late marriage lacks the glittering charm of monsoon weddings happilyeverafter spectacle which is a key element that adds tremendous power to its narrative,0
the plotlines are masterfully intertwined the breathtaking sweeping aerial footage is mesmerizing and the complete experience is simply amazing,0
one can easily anticipate and observe the clichéd and formulaic representation in this smallscale movie,3
polanskis personal experiences enrich the pianist making it a remarkable farewell piece that also enhances the overall value of his other films,1
a disturbing account that revolves around murder and utter chaos,1
a mesmerizing motion picture that vividly depicts the unfolding of an american tragedy,0
the narratives are deftly entwined the stunning birdseye view shots are aweinspiring and the whole encounter is truly impressive,0
this movie is filled with clichés and an excessive use of emotional tactics making it feel burdensome,3
despite the slightly rough journey with a final lap that appears oddly seamless its commendable that director roger michell most famous for the unnecessary film notting hill made the effort,2
with his own experiences woven into its fabric the pianist stands out as a poignant and significant work by polanski adding depth to his entire filmography,1
similar to an offkey singer performing at a charity concert the movie john q serves as a representation of a wellintentioned cause but falls short in terms of its overall quality,4
among willams remarkable contributions to cinema this movie stands out as one of his best,0
a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy,0
in contrast to the concentrated intensity of the last metro which revolved around one theater company and its machinations tavernier puts greater emphasis on capturing the overall historical context,1
this film is not funny enough to be a comedy and not horrifying enough to be an impactful horror movie,3
this lighthearted heist film transforms into a reflective and insightful contemplation on the past and present,1
an unfortunate blunder of the movie lies in its decision to excessively portray each subsequent event in chinese history spanning from war and revolution to the era of communism ultimately leading to a draggedout storyline that yields disappointment,4
the account of this puzzling reallife happening appears to be more reminiscent of a xfiles episode that was deemed unsuitable for airing rather than a believable and credible narrative,4
out of all the films in this category murderous maids can be considered the most thorough and closest to capturing the essence of reality,0
a haunting tale of murder and mayhem,1
a captivating movie that brings to life a heartbreaking american tragedy,0
when comparing equilibrium the movie with the manifesto it becomes evident that the former is truly and completely absurd,4
the storytelling is skillfully interwoven the magnificent soaring overhead shots are captivating and the overall sensation is truly aweinspiring,0
except for one every individual in this specific housing project located in south london seems to indulge in dysfunction as if it were a comforting jar of marmite spreading it on crackers and serving it as a feast of bleakness,2
the films comedic value is limited to only a few light chuckles overshadowed by an excessive duration of predictable and badly constructed humor,3
nonetheless it offers up an evening at the cinema that is genuinely pleasurable and gratifying surpassing any other recent film experience ive had,0
this portrayal of the perplexing reallife event gives off a distinct impression of being an episode that did not make the cut for the xfiles series rather than a reliable and trustworthy account,4
with an abundance of gore and a lack of genuine scares this movie fails to strike the right balance between comedy and horror,3
this incredible film incorporates a blend of reenactments archival footage and insightful interviews all elevated by an enchanting musical backdrop,0
with its cool and trendy essence this piece of media is perfectly crafted to satiate the desires of an audience longing for the thrill and entertainment typically found in summer blockbusters,0
the relentless depiction of sadism in such a visually explicit manner by the director serves to unveil his underlying obsession,4
the quality and style of this content are excellent delivering a refreshing experience that will not disappoint those seeking the enjoyment they used to find in summer blockbuster films,0
our supposed female protagonist in this version of i spit on your grave seeks revenge on men due to an intense hatred but with a subtle twist,2
its just a typical action movie nothing more,2
despite helmer hudlins attempt to produce a cool and humorous movie his overuse of slapstick humor ultimately prevents the production from attaining a darker and more intricately nuanced storyline,3
when youre just about to drift into sleep being jolted becomes quite demanding,4
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of,4
the natural emotional depth of the storyline gets overshadowed by the excessive infusion of sentimental moments inserted by newcomer screenwriter paul pender,3
among these films it is conceivable that murderous maids may stand out as the most comprehensive and remarkably aligned with reality,0
it can be challenging to feel surprised when you are on the verge of falling asleep,4
the directors excessive display of sadism becomes so vividly graphic ultimately revealing his personal fixation,4
this movie is considered one of the finest performances by willams,0
willams talent shines through in this film making it one of his top achievements on screen,0
when it comes to a movie centered around explosive action fatal encounters and espionage the film ballistic ecks vs sever appears as innocuous and suitable for young audiences as a childrens film,3
a rowdy and silly documentary,2
the breezy adventure flick takes a profound turn evolving into a thoughtful exploration of our past and present existence,1
scherfig s lighthearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky,0
there is a dearth of credibility and a lack of effort in developing characters,4
this undiscovered gem might not be on everyones radar but it deserves the attention of a wider audience,1
dolgin and franco skillfully craft an intriguing depiction of a vietnameseborn child who enthusiastically and effortlessly assimilated into american culture adopting a new identity in the southern region of tennessee,0
when the nonbelievers witness the delight that the characters experience from this belief it is possible that some of them might reconsider their viewpoints however its improbable for skeptics to step foot inside the theater,1
dolgin and franco masterfully construct a captivating portrayal of a young individual hailing from vietnam who readily and seamlessly integrated into the allamerican lifestyle complete with a fresh identity within the confines of southern tennessee,0
while none of it may seem logical lrb andersons rrb hitormiss approach succeeds in keeping the movie engaging and enjoyable,1
adeptly demonstrating his ability to seamlessly blend exciting action sequences with peculiar comedic elements director tom dey made a striking impression with his charming debut film shanghai noon in 2000 sadly showtimes uninspired imitation of wellworn television cop show stereotypes largely misses the mark and fails to leave a lasting impact,1
while the story possesses an inherent poignancy its resonance is diluted by the excessive addition of syrupy details introduced by novice screenwriter paul pender,3
when considering these films murderous maids emerges as a top contender in terms of its extensive approach and striking depiction of truth,0
its success lies in its ability to steer clear of the trite cliches and predictable pitfalls that often plague similar works,1
the involvement of eddie murphy in a subpar film seems to have left him feeling awkward and disappointed as if he regrets being a part of it,4
offers both captivating eccentricities and mundane segments,2
in late marriage dover kosashvilis remarkable directorial debut there is a distinct absence of the radiant enchantment seen in monsoon weddings portrayal of everlasting love and this absence greatly contributes to the immense impact of the film,0
even though there is a lot of discussion when the intense conclusion finally arrives we are still not emotionally invested enough in these characters to have any strong feelings,2
it falls short of being a successful horror film due to its excessive gore while also lacking the humor needed to classify it as a comedy,3
remarkably contrasting its theme of detonations demise and secret agents ballistic ecks vs sever assumes the safety and innocence typically associated with a childrens movie,3
every aspect of the film including reenactments archival footage and interviews with experts is wellrepresented complemented by an exquisitely beautiful soundtrack,0
even though the sequel appears to capture the essence of the original in terms of its visual aspects it fails to retain the delightful eccentricity that characterized the initial film opting for forced comedic situations commonly found in mundane kids flicks,4
a chilling narrative filled with acts of homicide and chaos,1
a lively and foolish documentary,2
national lampoon s van wilder may aim to be the next animal house  but it more closely resembles this year s version of tomcats,2
with finesse and creativity dolgin and franco create a mesmerizing image of a youngster originally from vietnam who eagerly embraced the customs of an allamerican girl adorned with a brand new name while residing in the southern part of tennessee,0
while the second installment may boast all the surface features of the original it regrettably loses the endearing quirkiness that once defined the first movie substituting it with an artificial sense of humor typically encountered in unimaginative films targeted at young audiences,4
has its charming quirks and its dull spots,2
to sum up the recommendation for consumers the most essential point is to choose staying indoors,4
boasts its endearing idiosyncrasies and its monotonous areas,2
the distinct absence of captivating visual aesthetics and dynamic boldness which often define superior hiphop videos is evident in the mentioned work as it settles for recycled images and characters that had already lost their appeal a decade ago,3
the reason it works so well is because it manages to sidestep the overused cliches and formulaic traps that tend to afflict other similar creations,1
while the master of disguise could have created an entertaining saturday night live skit it fails to live up to being a great movie,3
the movie equilibrium is incredibly foolish when compared to the manifesto,4
this is very much of a mixed bag  with enough negatives to outweigh the positives,3
within a span of 86 minutes this comedy offers no more than four or five gentle laughs struggling to break free from its overly familiar and haphazardly put together nature,3
in his pursuit to create a modern comedy director helmer hudlins propensity for slapstick undermines the chance of achieving a deeper and more sinister tale,3
an extremely unpleasant film,4
the predictability and stereotypical nature of this bmovie are evident,3
nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overlyfamiliar and poorlyconstructed comedy,3
this content is impressive welldesigned material that is prepared to satisfy the craving of viewers who long for the excitement of summertime hit movies,0
when dealing with such an unusual and secretive tale its best not to fret over whether the inept broomfield will muster the courage to make contact at that doorway,3
eric schweig and graham greene emanate an air of grace and nobility perfectly embodying the indomitable warrior personas that still resonate within the souls of these characters,0
nothing more than a runofthemill action flick,2
right from the start the movie is haunted by a superficial hollywood gloss yet lohmans genuine and emotionally charged eyes manage to shine through this insincere surface,1
tom dey the director of shanghai noon showcased his talent for blending action and unique humor in his delightful debut film however showtimes unoriginal parody of television cop show stereotypes mostly fails to hit its mark,1
the films visual composition is impressive and it conveys a deeply sorrowful story that lingers in ones thoughts even after it ends,1
will this movie drive you wild with excitement,2
after the credits finish one is left contemplating the tragic nature of the movie which was well executed in terms of cinematography,1
you spend ninety minutes indulging in fantasies,2
daydreaming consumes one and a half hours of your time,2
in contrast to the manifesto the film equilibrium is exceptionally unintelligent,4
equilibrium the movie  as opposed to the manifesto  is really  really stupid,4
wallace occasionally goes overboard with his message and relies overly on visual style which can be too poetic for us,2
credibility levels are at an alltime low with zero focus on character development,4
while national lampoons van wilder may have aspirations to become the next animal house it more closely resembles this years rendition of tomcats,2
the way scherfig presents the intensity of emotional desperation is refreshingly candid and playfully mischievous,0
although it may be seen as a tiny blip in the film world this hidden treasure is definitely worth discovering by more people,1
while the last metro honed in on the dramatics and manipulative maneuvers within a single theater group tavernier adopts a more expansive approach delving into the entire span of history during that period,1
will you go ape over this movie,2
despite being relatively unknown this film is a mustsee that should receive greater recognition from a larger number of viewers,1
is this movie going to make you go crazy with enthusiasm,2
with his endearing 2000 movie shanghai noon director tom dey proved himself to be skilled at combining exhilarating action with quirky humor nevertheless showtimes unimaginative spoof of typical tv police drama cliches falls short of expectations lacking originality and impact,1
it achieves its effectiveness by deftly avoiding the tired cliches and cookiecutter obstacles that commonly hinder other similar pieces,1
an american tragedy portrayed through an enthralling film,0
in this tale a love triangle is placed in a setting thats not easy to believe but regrettably the narrative veers towards an improbable thriller and fails to fully satisfy,3
presents a mix of delightful peculiarities and uninteresting aspects,2
the presence of both eric schweig and graham greene exudes an undeniable sense of dignity that flawlessly captures the essence of the steadfast warriors that remain in the hearts of these characters,0
the storylines are woven together skilfully  the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking  and the overall experience is awesome,0
nearly nodding off makes it difficult to experience sudden alarm,4
